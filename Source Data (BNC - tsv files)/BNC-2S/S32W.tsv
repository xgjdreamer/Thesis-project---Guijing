S0007	high tech bite of equipment
S0018	it's very professional
S0007	mm
S0018	it give really good sound quality as well fantastic so yeah so you use to be a sport journalist
S0007	well yeah i'm still try to so i be in the loose sense of the word um i er go to university six years ago now and um yeah like er i never grow up want to be a sport journalist i want to be a a sport athlete or sport performer
S0018	yeah what what sport
S0007	football and tennis be the er
S0018	uh huh
S0007	two big ones i grow up play tennis probably before football when i be about four
S0018	uh huh
S0007	and then pick up football about at the age of about ten um but then when i get to i would say about thirteen fourteen i realize that neither be gonna be er my profession for the rest of my life i be think well what else can i do and when it come to like decide your options when you're seventeen i think
S0018	mm mhm
S0007	well what could i do
S0007	i could do journalism instead i'm perhaps if i'm not there like play on the pitch in the the the major finals well it mean i can be report on it um
S0018	get free ticket
S0007	get free ticket and like yeah just get to meet some of these these people you watch on tv
S0007	and that be like the real sell point for me so yeah i go about it and um study at university
S0018	mhm
S0007	do three years on a um honour degree and
S0018	be that a a specifically sport journalist
S0007	it be yeah that be one of the things that be a real real appeal cos er there be
S0018	yeah
S0007	quite a lot of journalism course across the country but
S0018	mhm
S0007	only a handful do do specifically sport journalism so
S0018	uh huh
S0007	um my er reflections on it be the degree itself wasn't the biggest contributor to me get a job in sport journalism i think it kind of teach you about it
S0018	mhm
S0007	didn't really hone your skills as a writer
S0018	really
S0007	only a couple of modules be really kind of specific and they be in the latter year so you could've almost compact into one year
S0018	really
S0007	but obviously er degrees be degrees and universities be the way they be it's about make money as much as anything so
S0018	it be i agree um yeah i could've do my degree in two years i think the first year be like we didn't even have to get more than forty percent
S0007	yeah
S0018	to get into the second year
S0007	that's yeah likewise and you can drop a module as well
S0018	yeah
S0007	and just essentially not turn up for it and
S0018	mm
S0007	it be like twelve hours a week and and you do have the read time to do around it which i do but you that'd be thirty hours top that they'd expect of you to really go on and i at first cos i be always kind of i've always be competitive and er academically i'd always wanna try and get the highest mark i could
S0018	mhm
S0007	so i set about try to obviously get a first and um in the end it it it wasn't about that it's about the experience you get and and
S0018	mm
S0007	unfortunately for me on the two er years that they have like have a six week work placement i have mumps the first year
S0018	oh no
S0007	so i miss out on that
S0018	oh
S0007	and then the second year i get a really good one for cos i'm i be a a lad at heart but my dad's from
S0018	uh huh
S0007	so i'm a half scouser
S0007	and um yeah i try to get a job well a work placement at their um their website and i get that one you know sort provisional sort and that fell through er a couple of days before
S0018	huh
S0007	it be really late notice
S0018	oh no
S0007	they say oh we can't we really sorry we've double book um so i be kind of leave in the lurch so
S0018	be that for er liverpool football club
S0007	yeah
S0018	tut what a shame
S0007	so when it come to me graduate i be really panic at that point think oh i've get no experience whereas everyone else have get
S0018	yeah
S0007	good good solid foundation er i be quick to get some some kind of work experience line up and it just turn out everything fall fell in place i i apply to get on a postgrad cos at first i think oh
S0018	mhm
S0007	i need to maybe have another extra qualification to make me stand out
S0018	mhm
S0007	we hadn't learn shorthand which er still to this day i've never
S0018	mm
S0007	do which i think be kind of er an essential thing of do journalism
S0018	mhm
S0007	but um yeah from that
S0018	do you do a postgrad as well
S0007	the postgrads the it be a print journalism base one there wasn't an online one
S0018	ah
S0007	which be what i really want to get into
S0018	uh huh
S0007	but i get um a work experience placement um at a website call teamtalk which be a football um site and they when i get the placement they be be buy out by sky sport
S0018	mhm
S0007	um and they be all put them in one big office with about five other websites up in and that be the thing that be surprise that it be all up in so i just go back up to after graduate and just go think oh i'll do the work placement and um the postgrads be like well that's not really what we be look for for you to get experience somewhere like an office place unfortunately cos you haven't get enough to get on the course
S0018	tut oh no
S0007	so i be
S0018	what what be they look for then
S0007	they well they be just some some kind of experience in a in a press room do print journalism
S0018	right
S0007	so i couldn't i try to er er like er here up in leeds
S0018	yeah
S0007	anywhere er
S0018	it's so difficult isn't it
S0007	and it er you have to know someone in there who who kind of just go oh put this guy in
S0018	yeah
S0007	and that's what happen to me when i be at teamtalk um i be up there and do the two weeks and just think i'll do it just because just obviously get the experience but to enjoy it and um i have a great time up there and in the first week er there be a vacancy at sky for a freelancer so the editor of teamtalk say i'm not gonna beat around the bush like there's some i've get like twenty cvs here that i've keep from other people but you're here now so this be your chance so
S0018	brilliant
S0007	put you forward
S0018	mm
S0007	so i have another two weeks at sky
S0018	mhm
S0007	and then they offer me a contract there like as a like a roll year contract and um yeah i spend two and a half years up there and some ways it be um obviously here with david lloyd er give you all all you could ever want
S0018	yeah
S0007	work on the bar but but the that give me a little bite more and
S0018	yeah
S0007	some of the stuff i get to do i i in in my wildest dream i think when i be think yeah sport journalism would be great i'd get to er write about the tennis perhaps
S0018	mhm
S0007	that'd be one of my main sport i get to write er the match report in all four grand slam finals
S0018	okay
S0007	so while i be there so
S0018	cool
S0007	then commentary as well and like a lot of it be text commentary not a lot of it be um on the radio or anything
S0018	mhm
S0007	like that cos they've get er a radio station there but but i manage to interview a couple of people as well and go to er a large football match and do a do a thing like er minute by minute commentaries
S0018	cool oh yeah
S0007	um yeah the stuff you can get on er
S0018	the up update yeah
S0007	yeah
S0018	that's how i watch the formula one now it's be sell to sky
S0007	yeah so be you a big fan of formula one
S0018	i be yeah i do like it
S0007	yeah i'm er i've i've grow to like it i i there be something about when sky get it that they kind of try and make it a bite more
S0018	tut
S0007	er er a bite more than it be shall we say
S0018	mm yeah
S0007	but
S0018	well they've pretty much double the amount of race since
S0007	since they've take it on er well they've get all
S0018	since yeah
S0007	the all the qualify now and everything
S0018	mm
S0007	um
S0018	mhm
S0007	but yeah so you know the two and a half years up there some of the other stuff i get to write be be fantastic the only
S0018	and you didn't fancy stay up there
S0007	well er the the only downside be be the pay it be um the the er the contract they have be so bind in in the sense that you couldn't write for another
S0018	mm
S0007	journalist company without their permission
S0018	right
S0007	um you be only pay six pound an hour with no pay rise
S0018	you're joke
S0007	it be er just roll or and and the
S0018	tut
S0007	worst bite of it there be no set hours
S0018	yeah
S0007	you be contract to so you be er as a freelance they could just turn round and and give you one shift a month and that be it
S0018	yeah
S0007	and when i when i first be up there i use my save to to um finance me be up there and i be er i at first it be suppose to be just a two week trial and you know six week go by and i still hadn't be pay and i be just like well you know what's go on guy what you haven't be pay oh sorry and it be kind of like so i'd be just survive on my my um save alone so when i do get my money the money back that that be owe to me i kind of it be still stuff to pay off overdrafts and
S0018	mm
S0007	and and what not but yeah and and it huh for two and a half years from where i be when i first start which i think be a really raw and kind of untrained
S0018	mm
S0007	journalist to be where i be when i when i finish work there er and i be still on the same wage and it be a bite dishearten cos er
S0018	crazy totally i mean it's
S0007	er
S0018	and also six pound an hour and not give you a set number of shift so you know how much money you're gonna earn
S0007	no so yeah
S0018	the next month and i've be in that situation with teach over in spain that you
S0007	what be that like
S0018	depend on how many students they have as to whether you get work the next month
S0007	yeah er
S0018	and well er basically that's why i move back to england cos i'd just have it up to here with not know if i be gonna be able to make my rent the next month
S0007	yeah
S0018	never know when i'd have holiday
S0007	mm
S0018	probably wouldn't have get to have a holiday cos i'd have to be work
S0007	yeah
S0018	you know just get random class here and there just to
S0007	yeah i can relate to that cos er it
S0018	make end meet
S0007	from a for a point if you wanna do well in a career and like i'd decide er after uni stuff and i love like i've always love sport but i love write as well i love the
S0018	mm
S0007	the creative aspect and i love like er when you do the commentaries i use to love the like er you could get banter with with a lot of the the the members er that come on and would read and would give you feedback and
S0018	mhm
S0007	and you'd build like rapport and like use like things like twitter you could build up like a real like kind of reputation for yourself
S0007	um but yeah it it be er it like that er aspect it be it's character build obviously not know if you're gonna have enough money to and then it make me kind of
S0018	mm
S0007	be a bite more astute cos i get a job at er the david lloyd's up up there i work at the york one for a while
S0018	uh huh
S0007	and i work at and it kind of add a lot more string to my bow and that be er a really good period but it kind of all hinge on the huh the difference from from cos i've work here for um this be my first job at this place when i be sixteen so i'm twenty five now
S0018	ah
S0007	so i kind of work here when i be study and
S0018	uh huh
S0007	come back every now and then and um i be always work on in the er food and beverage department um and i really get use to that way of of of work that you be really interactive with members
S0018	mm
S0007	and really social and at sky you'd think be a journalist you'd have like a lot of people would er would have a lot to say but it be er in especially the sky sport area section
S0018	mhm
S0007	it be very robotic would the word i'd use
S0018	really
S0007	they would um you'd get er members of the team that could happily go a whole shift without talk to you they would just sit on the computer and it be like an office base job
S0018	mhm
S0007	it be my first experience of that and there be a lot of cliques and you'd be like as a freelancer you kind of weren't
S0018	mm
S0007	respect you um you would you'd er er kind of hot desk a lot of people and a lot of people would then get er er would give you grief about
S0018	what's hot desking i've hear this expression before
S0007	hot desking be where you er it would be the you come in and er you'd be the far um desks you'd have one one desk for the editor
S0018	mhm
S0007	his deputy and then the er and er it be split into two section and all sport which er cover everything apart from football um and then you'd have two more desks where you'd have the all sport team you'd have a team of about about there be six or seven of them um and there'd be one spare that could alwaysbe occupy by by a freelancer
S0018	uh huh
S0007	but then um you'd want like obviously they'd rotate who'd be on shift they'd only need probably four each day
S0018	mhm
S0007	maybe five depend on how much sport time on that desk so you'd er go on one of theirs
S0018	oh okay
S0007	and you kind of hot desking be when you can go round on other people's and some of them would lock their computers overnight know that you'd have to turn their computer off and and it and it just it do make the whole process very kind of
S0018	tut yeah hm
S0007	so there be a lot of cliquey stuff like that and um
S0018	what a shame
S0007	a football desk be even worse to a degree cos there be a lot more in football and the football command er er er desks of about ten to twelve
S0018	mhm
S0007	um and and yeah you have to kind of almost er earn your keep so the first like year er year to eighteen months be kind of me just try to fit in um be from my background of work here i'd always be like kind of really kind of like blow my own trumpet quite bubbly compare to everyone else
S0007	and a bite more personality
S0018	mhm
S0007	and that sometimes count against me and i would never have ever have a er get tell off or have er disciplinary action but i think i have a reputation as be a bite of a a chatter
S0018	mhm
S0007	um whereas they i think the editors themselves want people to come in start you do your job
S0018	and be robots
S0007	yeah
S0018	yeah
S0007	and then that's it and um i think i think it's quite hard to to be put your personalities into your work if you're not like that in
S0018	yeah
S0007	real life as well er i dunno some people one of the guy who be the best writer by far he be a quieter guy er er and didn't talk a lot but when he do talk he be still er as equally as colourful
S0007	as when er his write be um so i don't think they get ever get the balance right but i get from my i think through be there for two and a half years and be one of the most consistent of the freelancers i get offer er a contract a better contract to er cover for one of the guy who go on a er just er i'm try to think what the word be now um tut he basically go travel for a while
S0018	uh huh
S0007	i'm er
S0018	he have a sabbatical
S0007	sabbatical that's it um
S0018	mm
S0007	and he er
S0018	sound like he's join the church or something doesn't it
S0007	yeah that's right
S0007	and i think he go to peru for i think four or five months so i be cover for him
S0018	mhm
S0007	so i have regular hours but i still have my job at david lloyd and they make it clear that once er this be my chance to impress but once that four months be up i'd go back to the what i be do before and back to the freelance and back to the wage so i wasn't gonna quit my job at the other david lloyd
S0018	mm
S0007	but i be work quite a lot of hours and you'd you'd work eight and a half hours there and then at david lloyd you do eight hours and i do quite a lot of travel and basically i be late for two shift um and they sit me down and they be like elliot we're gonna have to review the whole system we're we're not gonna keep you on as the um on this sabbatical don't think it's work for us and i be just like obviously a bite shock and stun i be like oh well kind of er can i explain and type thing er well we've we've make the decision and i be like okay er and so what about then the freelance i'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go
S0018	tut
S0007	and that be it it be just like
S0018	what a care environment
S0007	yeah and er they use word like oh it's um there's no malice in this
S0018	mm
S0007	but but we need to make an example out of you
S0018	tut oh no
S0007	so i be just like
S0018	tut
S0007	that that be er quite i be like well do you realize i say like i've be here two and a half years and
S0018	mm
S0007	you you've never once bring up me er be late and i'm the type of person that i wouldn't say i'm er punctual wouldn't be the word er one of my first things that come to mind with me but when i be at sky er i'd always make sure that i be like first in last out if you will
S0018	mhm
S0007	um there'd be odd occasion like anything that you're run late and stuff and the two occasion like the one be i do fifteen days straight from the way david lloyd work that their their rotas be do friday to thursday so
S0018	mhm
S0007	if they're gonna give you two days off it might not necessarily be like which be what they should do
S0018	yep
S0007	it might roll over into a different week
S0018	mm
S0007	so when with the way sky do it it mean that er i be do one day where i be do fifteen days one period where i do fifteen days and it be on the fifteenth day i be put on the early shift um with another guy the editor who's suppose to always be in and he book a day off so it be just me open if they'd tell me that i er might i don't know if it would've change anything but i'd always expect him to be in so it turn out that i be the only would would've be the only one open the like the website content for the all sport section and er the the main editor turn up at eight o'clock when it be suppose to be a seven a m start and be like where's my landlord who be a a full time member at sky sport in the in the in the football desk be like i don't know and he be like call me and stuff and i be just completely conk out wake up and didn't didn't hear my alarm or anything like that and
S0018	oh no
S0007	then i get in at half nine and i get um er a tell off shall we say
S0018	yeah
S0007	quite a quite a severe one and he be like okay well i'm gonna speak to the rest of the team and talk about mm mm this er because this er this be the first time i've know of you be late
S0018	mhm
S0007	um and just get on with your job type thing i have a day off er um and then another day off and then be back in on the sunday and i'd arrange to go and watch a football match back here in and my train be delay on er
S0018	oh no
S0007	like and i and i kinda take take the risk i think i'll get the train the next day
S0018	mhm
S0007	um cos i have an open return and then the next train i get in the morning it would've mean that i would've be literally two minutes late and i send an e mail out say i i know i'm on kind of on on thin ice here and i just wanna give you a head up i'm gonna be literally five minutes late
S0018	mhm
S0007	however the train itself get get stick
S0018	oh
S0007	and it get delay by an hour and a half
S0018	oh no tut
S0007	and i er come in to work and it it wasn't er er like it
S0018	uh
S0007	wasn't like er the similar situation where i um tut he be rely on me be in
S0018	uh huh
S0007	however it be just the principle and and the the all sport editor at the time be just like you he be a quite a malicious person he be just like well i'm sorry i'm gonna have to tell about it he be like you've you be late again and you better have a good story prepare
S0018	tut
S0007	and he didn't even tell them what happen he just tell them i be late he didn't say er
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0007	the situation so they be almost like okay that's the final straw do deal and um he be one of the guy who be in the who be er there be two er the main editor and him er yeah and it it be just er it be quite bitter at the time and it be just such i be so devastate and i felt like oh it be such a such a great opportunity but i be er always i plan i be gonna do er do five years there and er i'd still be there now and i realize some of the things i i've sacrifice
S0018	mm
S0007	like just without think about it
S0018	yeah
S0007	like have a disposable income like i haven't get a great one here at the moment but still much better off than i be there like i'd literally have enough
S0018	yeah
S0007	to get by if not i'd have to kind of
S0018	scrape it together
S0007	scrape yeah
S0018	and
S0007	delay rent and
S0018	spend your save
S0007	yeah and
S0018	yeah
S0007	and so it er it while it er it be like a double edge sword while it be a great job and some of the things i do there wasn't the work environment there and the
S0018	mm that sound awful for them not to be sensitive and sympathetic to
S0007	yeah
S0018	someone who they employ on a six pound an hour basis
S0007	yeah
S0018	and not let them pursue other avenues of
S0007	yeah yeah yeah
S0018	employment while work for you that's work for them pathetic it really be
S0007	well that that's bskyb and the er that company i i believe
S0018	that's rupert murdoch
S0007	yes
S0018	isn't it we don't like sky then
S0007	no so i've still get sky membership at the moment well my mum pay it but
S0007	if i could i'd change to virgin put it that way
S0007	but yeah i'm er i'm still er since i've come back cos um that be in happen in may last year
S0018	uh huh
S0007	so i'd um and it in that sense it it the time be quite well because i could quickly make a decision to come back here and i think still have my job at leeds and york david lloyd's but i think er huh i i may as well come back here cos i still have i be do one shift a month here as well
S0018	mhm
S0007	and i think um it would be so much er huh so much of a better idea to come back home er i
S0018	mm
S0007	i do make good friends up in leeds but it i always use to come back here once a month anyway
S0007	so i be never felt like i'd i'd lose my tie here as well
S0018	mm do you grow up in the area
S0007	um i grow up i i'm from originally chelmsley wood
S0018	mhm
S0007	um not the er most glamorous of place but
S0007	er i live in yardley as well so
S0018	oh right
S0007	i've and i've i've that's where i'm back at now um and then one thing be er i i lose my er you er your independence it's er it's not the same as what it be when i be up there but i still can be as independent as i like really um i've get my mum i live with my mum at the moment and she's really flexible and er

S0007	the one yes and a hundred and ninety nine nos be still a yes so um
S0018	that's a good way of look at it
S0007	well yeah er i try
S0018	i'll remember that when i send out
S0007	yeah
S0018	my er my cv again
S0007	yeah
S0018	this weekend
S0007	but yeah you sort of when you unfortunately i think if you if you dwell on the things you like in the current economic crisis you you won't get anywhere so i think you have to
S0018	mm
S0007	try and be ultra positive and
S0018	yeah
S0007	you know like i've i kind of er after er three months of do it i think well i'm gonna have a little break and and just just concentrate on work here because this be a job as well bar supervisor you know if i weren't just full time in the bar i could um afford more time to do things out er outside and i can just literally come in and do my job but
S0018	mhm
S0007	a part of me think no i'd like a new challenge and perhaps just distance myself for six months er away from the journalism to refresh myself
S0018	mhm
S0007	and and get in cos i i'd work here for so long and i i really care about this but it almost feel like i'm my second home
S0018	oh
S0007	than and
S0018	have you think about manage get into management here
S0007	i do and i er er quickly realize that it's not for me
S0018	right
S0007	um
S0007	even in my supervisor role that um it's just not my i'm not that kind of person i think i'm i while i i like to lead by example i'm struggle with the kind of the man management of people and i don't like to er i dunno it's just i you know when you just realize somethings be aren't for you or or not yet
S0018	mm
S0007	anyway
S0018	you wouldn't have sack someone for be late twice
S0007	no
S0007	definitely not yeah i'll i if if i have have their kind of er attitude i'd have sack pretty much everyone here
S0007	er but um
S0018	mm
S0007	yeah it so it like er after after think and er again with the competitive side of we wanna try and make this this department the best in the country and we're still strive for that but it it's a long a long way down the line i think you need to er be in it for the long haul like i think twelve months like if i could literally get us on the the with my manager get us on the the point where we where it almost there and then then i could could go off and do my own thing but i've realize six months in now it's it's gonna it's gonna be like er two or three years and and i'm not prepare to to
S0018	mm
S0007	and wage and stuff and as much as i love work here it's i i need to do i need to be more fulfil so i start write my own blog er a couple of weeks ago

S0007	maybe advice and stuff
S0018	you know
S0007	or yeah yeah
S0018	advice contact anything
S0007	yeah i i well um i've i've never be one to to look a gift horse in the mouth and like i've manage to speak to like work here and work at dave lloyd's generally be be a great place to
S0018	mm
S0007	to network and to meet people
S0018	mhm
S0007	and i've have a lot of people give me some stuff for market but yeah like i know that i er i i think i would be happiest if i be could get back into some kind of er sport journalism base
S0018	mm
S0007	but just just to be creative i think for me and to be write be er or or to i dunno cos i feel like i never would i dunno i always will to try anything like broadcast journalism print journalism even like present so but i dunno if there's er a
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0007	market for too many brummies there that's the only thing
S0018	aw come on your
S0007	well you get well you
S0018	dulcet tone of the brummie accent
S0018	well no present would be cool surely
S0007	well one of the guy i use to work with as well and he be in the sky sport news radio and because i be like one of the most outgo there like you er you'd talk to cos they're they'd be the most outgo people the people obviously in radio cos that's huh kind of you can't be er mute and and then do your radio show i think so i'd always
S0018	mm
S0007	talk to them and we'd have like the the coffee and stuff like that and one and i saw um a couple of weeks ago he's now on sky sport news on the telly
S0018	oh right
S0007	so i be just like fantastic for him so
S0018	that's great but you um you're not gonna touch sky with a barge pole ever again
S0007	um no i i'm never one to to really hold a hold a grudge
S0007	er but er they'd have to pay me well put it that way compensate me for
S0018	how about contact him and see if he's make any contact that you could use
S0007	that's an idea
S0018	it's always
S0007	yeah
S0018	you know it's always um i i find especially in spain that it's always more who you know
S0007	yeah
S0018	and the contact that they know than
S0007	yeah definitely like i for me like i have felt like um a good break from from do it have kind of i i just just write my blog i just felt like a bite more didn't huh er like it might be er melodramatic bite more alive again i just feel like i'm back to me again
S0018	mm
S0007	be be creative so while i think it be good to take a break out i feel perhaps now i'm just think oh why didn't i carry on i probably might've be a bite happier cos it's be quite a tough six months as well be back here but
S0018	mhm
S0007	um
S0018	yes i know the feel move back
S0007	yeah
S0018	home
S0007	how's it for you then how be you find it
S0018	yeah
S0007	well er with the weather like this
S0018	i know
S0007	i suppose it's not too bad
S0018	the when the weather's like this it's gorgeous it's no there's no problem but yeah it's the lack of er dependable income and not you know you're enjoy socialize for example but then you're always think fff
S0007	should i be out
S0018	oh i should get home
S0007	shall i try this but yeah
S0018	write my cvs
S0007	mm
S0018	i should be do this i should be do that have i really get the money to spend on a meal out or and it yeah it's
S0007	yeah i'd like the
S0018	but
S0007	the time that come when i've i'm i don't have to think about that but i always say that i want to have a a career that i enjoy and that i don't i've never be a money motivate person until
S0018	no
S0007	recently
S0018	me either hm
S0007	so um do you say you live in barcelona
S0018	yeah
S0007	cos my my girlfriend she's pretty much she doesn't say she's fluent in spanish but for
S0018	uh huh
S0007	for my opinion i think she's really good um like and um
S0018	mhm
S0007	we're talk about go to barcelona for like a little get away and
S0018	brilliant yeah definitely
S0007	i've never be i've i've never be to mainland spain so i'd love to
S0018	mm
S0007	to check that out
S0018	do it
S0007	have you be anywhere else in spain
S0018	yeah i live in barcelona for eight years and murcia for six years murcia's down south near
S0007	yeah
S0018	alicante
S0007	yeah
S0018	but barcelona's definitely a fantastic place to visit
S0007	oh huh
S0018	yeah
S0007	yeah yeah i'd love to go there and i suppose you might know um cos danielle my girlfriend she want to start do spanish class
S0018	uh huh
S0007	do you know anywhere here around like locally or
S0018	mm locally the brasshouse
S0007	brasshouse
S0018	yeah they do language class
S0007	okay
S0018	and um at the er university in where do she live
S0007	mm she she live over way so er
S0018	be that be that north east
S0007	it's
S0018	it be isn't it
S0007	um
S0018	kind of out past
S0007	yeah it's not too far from er it's by er do you know erdington
S0018	yeah
S0007	or do know
S0018	yep yep
S0007	near there
S0018	yeah so er
S0007	um
S0018	edgbaston's probably a bite too far for her isn't it
S0007	or maybe somewhere if there's like the be er brasshouse in the city centre
S0018	yeah do she want do she want a course
S0007	like well she she want ideally something that we could both go to but i be like well we're at i'm know no spanish virtually
S0007	like um s or er i dunno that's about it to be fair
S0007	but um yeah she's obviously a lot she do it for seven years and she get an a in her a level but do you think that like there be class you could go to that could cater for all or be it kind of a bite
S0018	mm er probably
S0007	cos i just think er wouldn't it be a bite
S0018	conversation
S0007	yeah
S0018	class but even conversation class class might be stream
S0007	mm
S0018	have she speak it at all over the past seven years
S0007	well yeah like and she's er up until a couple of years ago she be do it like for her a level
S0018	oh okay
S0007	so yeah yeah so
S0018	she do it for seven years sorry
S0007	yeah yeah seven
S0018	i think you say she hadn't hadn't do it for
S0007	no no
S0018	seven
S0007	yeah yeah so er er be do it for seven years
S0018	okay yeah so she'll be at er probably quite an intermediate level and you're basic
S0007	novice
S0018	you're like
S0007	amateur
S0018	goal
S0007	yeah
S0018	i can say goal
S0007	i be gonna say any word i probably know be from football base things so
S0018	yeah corner
S0007	yeah
S0018	um tut then again i mean if you if she get private class or something and you find an accommodate teacher who would like let you get along with stuff on the side
S0007	mm
S0018	while she be do her main lessons and you maybe listen to it you'd pick up stuff and
S0007	mm yeah perhaps
S0018	mm
S0007	that'd be good
S0018	you er seem to be you seem to possess all the characteristics of a good language learner it's like
S0007	mm
S0018	you know you're not afraid to talk and
S0007	well maybe that's true
S0018	um yeah no it's er a a lot of the time it's not have the confidence to speak that inhibit you when you're first learn i mean if you've get a good memory and you do a bite of study at home there's no reason why you couldn't at least you know
S0007	mm
S0018	be there when she be have a class
S0007	no definitely
S0018	i've get a friend who work at city university she's um tut half spanish half polish and she's marry to a spaniard
S0007	oh right
S0018	um yeah
S0007	so i guess she speak can speak quite a lot of languages then
S0018	yeah she speak fluent spanish fluent english fluent polish i imagine be a native um but yeah no if you're interest in a private class then
S0007	yeah well i'll cos i've
S0018	i can ask her or
S0007	we say at the start yeah this be something we can do and i know that we've be put it off so i just would like to kind of get the ball roll for her really so she can er yeah so perhaps if um i'll have a chat with her and see er what what what ideas she have if she'd rather do um something that we can both do the er emphasis or whoever it's about her keep up the spanish cos i'm happy to like i say if it it'd be sit in and just just learn bits and bob and just try to have a a ground of it
S0018	mhm
S0007	whereas if she want to be able to keep it and really use it cos i just think it be like one thing i regret be and i think's perhaps something to do largely with um the curriculum be just the the languages er and how early we we learn cos i start didn't learn er er a foreign language until i be twelve and i do i love learn german and
S0018	mm
S0007	it be great and like i really like embrace it and at first it be just like do the accent
S0007	like to be a laugh
S0007	but but it be like my german teacher would go no good
S0007	and all this
S0018	that be good ja
S0007	yeah
S0007	so we'd all like all have really get like get into it that way and yeah like i'd i'd i'd er happy like cos i'd love to have have learn like like one thing be be i remember er it always stick with me within my mind when i use to
S0018	mhm
S0007	work in when i be like sixteen seventeen get to know a couple of members um both er foreign and they both come here to er to teach
S0018	mhm
S0007	one to teach french the other to teach italian one be french and one be italian and their kid grow up here and they be all do some drink at the bar and um er the one child i think start to say something in italian and he respond in english and then the mother respond in french and they be all have
S0007	like a three way conversation with all in different languages and i just think that be just so impressive
S0007	and that be one of the first things when i meet er that really kind of make me like ah you can speak another language excellent
S0007	but um
S0018	what do she do
S0007	she's at the moment she's study fashion and retail management
S0018	oh
S0007	at uni
S0018	ah which one which uni
S0007	er the the one at the i think
S0018	uh huh
S0007	the er college of art i think it be and er
S0018	ah biad
S0007	i think it be yeah that er
S0018	ah i work there in the summer
S0007	ah
S0018	yeah
S0007	excellent
S0018	be she do er an undergrad
S0007	yeah
S0018	degree
S0007	undergrad degree at the moment
S0018	ah okay
S0007	yeah
S0018	she's probably on the course with a lot of the chinese students that i teach in the summer cos i have to prepare them er in like academic study like er study skills and
S0007	oh okay
S0018	make sure their english be brush up for them to start in september
S0007	be you er do you speak any chinese or
S0018	no
S0007	i be gonna say
S0007	i be think then you you
S0018	nothing
S0007	i er what language you spanish obviously
S0018	spanish french english and a bite of catalan which be the language they use in barcelona
S0007	oh so from barcelona yeah mm oh that's
S0018	yeah but
S0007	see i think that's just cos i think for a lot of english people it's like we don't i think the perception be that we don't think that we need to learn another language really
S0018	mm yeah
S0007	which be a shame
S0018	it be
S0007	but
S0018	people be very imperialistic about speak languages even my parent who be very communicative sympathetic people you know they go abroad and they turn into these english
S0018	i don't know er english imperialists
S0007	yeah
S0018	and my dad's favourite be scusi scusi
S0007	yeah
S0018	i don't know what language he think it come from but
S0018	he just kind of
S0007	it's a generic one just to get attention
S0018	er oh no
S0007	yeah
S0007	oh no but that's er that's something but yeah like er she do er fashion retail management and
S0018	fashion and retail management mm i'm just try to think of fashion design or fashion fashion and retail management
S0007	i think it's i er i think it's just one course i don't think it's like a split up of of two
S0018	uh huh
S0007	um but like for instance at the moment she's do um a project on three different trend that that they've be give that that be actual trend that be apparently come in the next
S0018	mhm
S0007	next season and they've gotta do like a board for it and then a presentation and then an essay and then they've gotta do like er she do one on asos as well where she have to do the whole market side of it
S0018	yeah
S0007	so it's really
S0018	mm
S0007	kind of prepping them for that and
S0018	yeah biad be fantastic for you know um vocational type
S0007	mm
S0018	train
S0007	yeah
S0018	i've get a friend there at the moment she's do a master in product design management
S0007	okay
S0018	yeah
S0007	cos they all sound like er like er they could be so
S0018	mm
S0007	open end couldn't they but
S0018	mhm
S0007	whereas like not for me like when people say er you can do a degree in sport journalism
S0007	like but they do they can be so specific as well and um yeah like and she she love that and i think but she um she's always she work as well at um nars cosmetics
S0018	uh huh
S0007	in there's a there's a a stall they've get in in the bullring in selfridges and i think she absolutely love that and she's more
S0018	mm
S0007	love love the beauty side of things like fashion be be um she love fashion but i think as a profession i think she like to do the beauty side more so she's get aspirations to to perhaps
S0018	mhm
S0007	go down to london and and and like either do like cos she she's someone as well who's quite um
S0018	mm
S0007	tut media savvy er and and can write as well
S0018	mhm
S0007	so um when we er have our our first date we talk about like what our dream job would be and we'd be like i'd be like an editor of er a successful sport website or something and she be like oh i'd be an editor of a of a magazine either a fashion or a beauty fashion magazine so we both kind of we get similar
S0018	uh huh
S0007	er career paths
S0018	how about start a start up a magazine for sport people who want to be beautiful
S0007	er the the we talk about that that's what we we er we come up with on the er after the end of the first date so we say well why don't we combine them
S0007	we'll have like in one half have yours
S0007	and then the second half and and and we'll er
S0018	how to be beautiful on the tennis court
S0007	yeah
S0007	that's it your skin'll look great while you hit an ace
S0018	there you go what with um the press slat what's her face stella mccartney
S0007	yeah
S0018	for
S0007	that's right
S0018	the design of her sport be it i can't
S0007	yeah
S0018	for the olympics
S0007	it's er all the for the olympics yeah cos
S0018	the uniform
S0007	you've get mix review yeah some people be er
S0018	yeah
S0007	be very er
S0018	i just can't believe how skimpy the female
S0007	yeah like and
S0018	uniform be get
S0007	er and some of it as well it doesn't even look like it represent britain i just think
S0018	mm
S0007	it's not you er you gotta have the colour that we that that make up the er the the flag and i think oh
S0018	yes apparently there wasn't enough red on
S0007	yeah
S0018	her uniform
S0007	mm
S0018	what do you call the wouldn't be a uniform would it the the
S0007	um on the
S0018	gear
S0007	yeah
S0018	sport gear
S0007	apparel or apparel or
S0018	uh huh i don't know
S0007	i dunno there's er um
S0018	but yeah apparently er red be psychologically helpful as well because it put the enemy off
S0018	opponent not the enemy it's not a war
S0007	well er
S0007	no as i say you be get into journalistic term there
S0007	that's what we'd do
S0007	we'd try and er dramatic
S0018	yeah like er all of my journalist friends all er all the time they're like terrorists or freedom fighters
S0007	huh
S0018	choose your word carefully
S0007	yeah
S0018	and where do you meet
S0007	um we meet it be funnily enough the the last time er i when i come back and i go
S0018	it wasn't david lloyd be it
S0007	we be on a david lloyd night out
S0018	uh huh
S0007	um er but i just meet her randomly in a a club we go to um a place call bushwhackers which be open have you be
S0018	no
S0007	yeah no but
S0018	but i've get a friend who
S0007	yeah
S0018	live opposite
S0007	where it be yeah
S0018	and er it open at two p two a m
S0007	yeah
S0018	or something
S0007	that's right um and one of her friends who she work with um
S0018	yeah
S0007	run the vip section so she get in there and i er be out with a lot of the guy here and it be like a gym night out so
S0018	mhm
S0007	traditionally the gym staff er go out and they drink quite early and they can't handle their drink
S0007	um and then they go home early and me be the a university graduate and
S0007	six years up in so i i could i'm er drink them under the table shall we say
S0007	and um only one guy who be a member here er he he be the last guy to stay out and he be just like we'll just we'll stay out
S0018	last guy stand
S0007	yeah with me yeah and um i be just kind of like i don't really wanna go and it be like er it be two o'clock and we be or about half two cos they literally we go in and when it open and they have one drink and they be all ready to go and i be just like you just pay ten pound to get in like well you you may as well stay for another
S0018	you have to pay to get in as well
S0007	a tenner mm
S0018	be it er so what be it
S0007	so it's like er
S0018	it's just a bar
S0007	it's not a bar it's er it it be big enough it's not a club but it's like kind of these hybrid these cross betweens
S0018	mhm
S0007	that's like it's big enough to have well they've get a dance floor and they've get an outdoor area and it's vip but it's not like a a big club and it they do try and make it quite exclusive
S0018	mhm
S0007	but yeah so i'm with this guy and the the member's fairly um affluent and he we weren't on the vip guestlist but he know who's 's mate and um he but he just say just like do what i do so we just kind of both go like that and just get into vip
S0007	and we be sit down and he it he be er he wasn't obviously afraid to to go and say hello to er a group of attractive girls whereas i be kind of a bite like
S0007	mm yes um and i think i my experience of vip be quite um tut snobby shall we say and er and er er kind of it's not about like when you say not not who you be it's what you own perhaps
S0018	mm
S0007	so i kind of make that presumption so i be kind of like okay we'll go in there and but i'm not really in my comfort zone right now
S0007	and then he go over there chat to them and he call me over and i i sit next to first
S0018	mm
S0007	and just introduce myself and i be just a bite like oh my god this be gonna be a
S0007	bite of an awkward conversation
S0018	painful
S0007	yeah but then when ten minutes later we're do borat impressions and
S0007	have a right laugh and and just mess around so and it just like just kind of grow from there really and i be still i be up in for another two months and um two to three months but yeah just we get to know each other and then have out first proper date when i come back in er in june and and yeah like we be talk about our own magazine and
S0007	stuff like that as a joke and yeah like we've be together now nine months so
S0018	ah super that must've make it easier to move back
S0007	yeah i think that be a definite um
S0018	pull
S0007	pull factor yes er so
S0018	sorry not that i'm say that you pull her but yeah
S0007	no
S0018	pull factor to get you back to
S0007	yes
S0007	yeah no definitely
S0018	cool and have you be back to bushwhackers since
S0007	i have have one more night back there and
S0007	to er to reminisce danielle wasn't there unfortunately but yeah i be er a a bite drunker that night actually
S0007	so i wasn't as on as er last man stand shall we say i be
S0007	probably first first faller that time so um yeah that's good
S0018	you join the gym
S0007	yeah i've er perhaps
S0018	the gym staff
S0007	yeah i've i've come down to their level unfortunately
S0018	so be they be the different er departments within
S0007	yeah
S0018	the sport centre like you er do they have different stereotype so the people who work in the gym can't drink and the
S0007	that's yeah that's a a general consensus for them you'd probably say the tennis guy in some ways but um cos i'm think of go down you know be a tennis coach
S0018	mm
S0007	if i'm stay here i'll start do um but i think the view of tennis coach be they're they perhaps earn the most money like in term of er er hourly rate if you will but they're the tightest
S0007	um and then you've get the er f and b team which be be er describe as the the louts
S0018	be that food and beverage
S0007	yeah food and beverage
S0018	be you a lout
S0007	mm apparently or or the the the party animals
S0007	as well as reception i think reception get get the similar tag
S0018	uh huh
S0007	um i'm try to think of other departments we've get
S0018	and be the management here be they quite um
S0007	sociable
S0018	er
S0007	be you gonna say or
S0018	accessible and
S0007	yeah
S0018	communicative
S0007	i'd say communication here it's it's a bite of a funny one in some ways very good
S0018	oh
S0007	but in some ways very very poor like
S0018	mm
S0007	cos i've have an experience of work at other david lloyd's
S0018	mhm
S0007	there's um tut i i dunno just er not not an elitist view but there's er er huh how to describe it like er a lot of people be quite sure of themselves in a certain position shall we say but then they don't back up with with what not a lot get
S0018	mm
S0007	do here and and i have notice as well like we have a tough crowd in in the members here there's a lot like a lot of people we er we're try to sell the er the racket dinner dance
S0018	mhm
S0007	it's an annual event we have and it's normally one of our big especially food and beverage it's our marquee event um er er there be a time cos obviously i've be here many years we use to get a hundred plus but er it it it's decrease over the years um at the moment we're only on sixty and we we need eighty really but you talk to a lot of members and er they'll they'll find anything to say why they shouldn't come
S0018	hm
S0007	but then they do turn up as well
S0007	so it's kind of i think people like to just have their say cos they can if you will
S0018	mhm
S0007	um but then er it's not really help that i don't think the management here be that proactive either so that be another thing for me what i've realize i don't
S0018	mhm
S0007	do a managementrole at this club specific be for me
S0018	yeah
S0007	cos i just don't think er i'm join in good company and it's not the right
S0018	mhm
S0007	atmosphere where when i be at york er and i go back up there last month to see um see a few friends and stuff i know straight away it'd be so i feel like i'd i'd get more do and i'd feel
S0018	mhm
S0007	better about my job so i don't really get the job satisfaction i be hop for here so
S0018	tut aw
S0007	which be a shame but i still i try and focus on the things i love like like serve er tut er huh try to think what your mum drink she have er sometimes have a latte and she'll have um
S0018	do she still have it with soya milk
S0007	soya milk
S0007	i be gonna say yeah
S0007	sometimes er decaf as well and
S0007	um your mum's very er very um what's the word
S0018	fizzy
S0007	no no no no no i be gonna say cos er clever be the or um resourceful she spot a few things on the kid's menu that look oh that look nice um er rather than pay over the odds on an adult's one
S0007	i probably won't eat all of i'll just get a kid's menu menu one and
S0007	a few time before i realize it be for your mum i'd bring kid's cutlery over
S0018	oh
S0007	here go you and she be go oh i'll eat it with the kid's ones and stuff like that
S0007	so
S0018	well she be little enough to
S0007	yeah mm
S0018	she be a sport teacher and she use to buy you know all her track suit and shell suit in
S0007	like the kid's size
S0018	kiddies' departments
S0007	really
S0018	yeah
S0007	that's brilliant
S0018	you don't have to pay vat on them either
S0007	oh excellent
S0018	then again i can't talk
S0007	mm
S0018	i only surpass her by one inch i think

S0018	uh huh
S0007	so it's not too far
S0018	that's where i'm learn to drive at the moment my drive instructor take me all round there
S0007	oh be you learn to drive
S0018	yeah
S0007	you see i'm i don't cos i don't drive yet at the moment
S0018	uh huh
S0007	i've i couldn't afford it when i be up in
S0018	mhm
S0007	so that's one thing that i'm i'm start get my provisional again now
S0018	cool well i can er recommend a brilliant um instructor
S0007	really
S0018	he's super yeah he's such a nice guy um
S0007	okay
S0018	i'm sure you'd
S0007	i'm definitely er go for that i've be wait for someone to recommend a good one to me
S0018	really
S0007	yeah so
S0018	oh brilliant then he only live up as well i think
S0007	oh wonderful
S0018	just opposite um where the old gasworks use to be
S0007	yeah yeah yeah
S0018	you know the mill pool
S0007	yeah yeah that's right
S0018	i think he live down there but no he's a lovely guy he use to be a builder and er he's a real kind of like brummie brummie kid brummie ain't it
S0007	oh yeah
S0018	and his two daughters play football and he take them out play football every weekend and he's
S0007	oh wonderful
S0018	he's a really nice guy
S0007	and how many lessons have you have so far then
S0018	i've have five five or six
S0007	have have you have you drive never before
S0018	never
S0007	no
S0018	apart from one
S0007	wow
S0018	time when i um a friend of my brother's be say oh do you want do you wanna have a go then and so i have a go and i reverse his car into a tree and er
S0018	it warp the body of the car so he couldn't open the open the passenger door
S0007	oh no
S0018	so yeah no i've never really learn to drive cos one as you say i couldn't afford it um i always prefer to spend my money on go away and
S0007	yeah
S0018	travel and
S0007	well that's be the thing for me er as well and have there
S0018	mm
S0007	be any other define factor or
S0018	no not
S0007	have you never really need to
S0018	well no that's the thing i've never really need to cos after after university i i move straight out to spain and like live in cities like barcelona you just don't need you know have a car be a liability
S0007	mm
S0018	cos you you have to pay for it to er pay for a park tut space for it and you never really use it the traffic's so bad in the city that it's easy to catch the er the metro the underground which be so convenient
S0007	mm
S0018	and
S0007	i can imagine
S0018	a good price and so no i just never really want to learn and in spain as well you have to pass the theory exam before you can even get behind a
S0007	a wheel
S0018	a wheel
S0007	i think that's a good idea in some ways
S0018	yeah i think it be although er the that put me off in spain
S0007	oh okay
S0018	just because i couldn't er
S0007	yeah you feel like a bite too much
S0018	well no it's just the motivation really
S0007	mm
S0018	if you've get the motivation of know that oh i'm actually gonna be learn the skill of drive that's quite motivate but then when you when you sign up for a twenty week course to learn how to drive but you're stick sit in front of a computer learn how to drive
S0007	mm
S0018	it's not as motivate
S0007	okay yeah
S0018	really
S0007	i suppose not
S0018	but
S0007	so why why have you why be you learn to drive now then be it just because you're move back here or
S0018	well it's basically cos i think it's a skill that if i don't use it i'll lose it if you
S0007	yeah
S0018	not but if i don't learn now i think it will be more difficult to learn in the future
S0007	mm cos my dad doesn't drive and he
S0018	really
S0007	he try when he be in his forties and he well he claim that he be just unlucky but no i know that it be just he's i think he isn't
S0018	mm
S0007	he's he's like i say he he'd lose the er appetite to learn stuff
S0018	mm
S0007	and i think he just find it a lot more challenge than he would've if he be younger and i be like i'm never go down that avenue but then i again i've er it's through i have er i've never really be someone who's i have to learn to drive type thing and i've always think well i'm quite happy use other form of transport and cycle
S0018	yeah
S0007	it's be fine but now it's i've grow so restless of
S0018	yeah
S0007	like i don't mind cycle but for me live in yardley and try to get to danielle's like tonight for instance i've gotta cycle home from here well jump on train anyway to er to cut out um some traffic and to save er save some time but then i've gotta jump on more train and it still mean even with a bike i've gotta
S0018	yeah
S0007	an hour and a half of go back home then go out to sutton
S0018	yeah it's the time
S0007	but
S0018	most of er all isn't it it's
S0007	yeah and it and it be that's the thing time's precious isn't it so it's
S0018	definitely
S0007	yeah well i'm if it what's the name of this guy then the
S0018	er
S0007	have he get like a do he
S0018	i've get his er mobile number here i'll give it to you actually wait there

S0007	no it's all good
S0018	let's see contact nuh nuh nuh nuh i nearly give you jake's number then
S0018	yeah no he's such a lovely guy i've um actually cancel this week's drive lessons cos we do emergency stop and go over a lot of speed bump last week and i've get a bite of a neck injury
S0007	oh have you
S0018	from before
S0007	from do it oh right
S0018	no from
S0007	oh from
S0018	a few a few years ago and it's be set off my neck again so i be like do you mind if we cancel what's your cancellation policy er do i still have to pay and he be like no don't worry no problem don't you don't have to pay he's a really nice guy
S0007	that's nice
S0018	okay so it's o seven
S0007	two second o seven
S0018	eight two three
S0007	eight two three
S0018	three three
S0007	three three
S0018	two eight
S0007	two eight
S0018	o four
S0007	o four
S0018	so o seven eight two three three three two eight o four
S0007	yeah
S0018	yeah
S0007	so put
S0018	er what's his surname oo
S0007	for now i'll put the drive instructor
S0018	that can be his surname
S0007	so i do er i've have one lesson and um
S0018	how do that go
S0007	i manage to turn get into second gear and turn constantly turn leave
S0007	that's start but it be so um kind of random the way it come about like i be just look into er
S0018	oh er
S0007	it be just kinda one of these things you know
S0018	that's his card i've get all my appointments on the back though but if you wanna look at it
S0007	okay um
S0018	so it's i i pay a hundred and seventy quid for ten lessons so it work out quite cheap
S0007	and that's something cos i've i've get a bite of a wager go with one of my friends who say oh he never think i'll ever drive
S0007	and and the challenge be to do it by um by the time the olympics start
S0018	uh huh
S0007	so i be gonna have ten lessons that be my plan and then perhaps do um an intensive course afterwards cos i i feel while if you could do an intensive course and pass straight away which i i i think i could do
S0018	mhm
S0007	i still think have those ten lessons over a longer period of time
S0018	yeah would you
S0007	be better
S0018	would somebody that you know be up for take you out to practice while you're have lessons
S0007	er a few of the guy here have as well they've say they'll do that so
S0018	cos er i reckon if cos some people darren be say some people can pass in ten lessons
S0007	mm
S0018	if you've get the aptitude for it and
S0007	see that that if if i could do that then that'd be great
S0018	yeah
S0007	rather than do the intensive as well
S0018	maybe you wouldn't even need to do an intensive yeah
S0007	mm
S0018	i wanna take more lessons cos i wanna get quite confident in the car
S0007	cos i think one thing i've get which would suit me cos i've cycle now for about five years i've er i've get like kind of i know roads and i know like kind of the the the highway code and i know kind of get that kind of
S0018	uh huh
S0007	instill upon me cos if if not i'd probably be dead now
S0018	yeah so you're probably quite good at manage traffic
S0007	but yeah
S0018	mm
S0007	um
S0018	that's one thing that freak me out i'm fine i'm so confident when i'm the only one on the road and then as soon as i see a car in the rear view mirror
S0007	you're just ah
S0018	i'm like huh oh no there's a car behind me
S0007	see i've not have that experience yet
S0018	yes it's call a road
S0018	there usually be more than one car on the road
S0007	no but yeah so i've gotta i've gotta pass before then as well and i just think that i'd still be someone who cycle quite a lot
S0018	mhm
S0007	cos i i i don't really do a lot of cardio upstairs if i use the gym and i play football as well now but yeah but just cycle it just mean
S0018	mm
S0007	that and i've get it's get like a purpose i don't feel like i ever i have to think i need to i need to do more cardio type thing i only
S0018	mhm
S0007	have to go up um if i wanna do weight or
S0018	mm
S0007	dunno like just get in shape for something then that's all i have to do so
S0018	do you get free membership here
S0007	you do
S0018	oh
S0007	not just for you but for another person as well
S0018	oh fantastic
S0007	so my dad's be the beneficiary for the last er nine years so
S0018	oh i bet he's happy that
S0007	yeah but um
S0018	he's get you as a son he's like no you don't wanna be a sport journalist son
S0007	yeah er
S0018	you carry on work at david lloyd
S0007	yeah well he er he's he's he's make sure that i keep sort of keep it for him as well
S0007	but yeah i mean er he's well that's the thing like this job it's i don't wanna ever feel like i'm ungrateful cos i be grateful for it but it's just you know when there come a point when you think i i need to
S0018	it's hold you back
S0007	yeah i need to i need to progress now and i think um once i get my drive underway and er er me and danielle have talk about potentially move to london and i'd happily get to start to get myself start get a job at a david lloyd's in london and
S0018	have they get er many down there
S0007	yeah they've get quite a lot actually and there's there's quite a few and some of them be really like the top exclusive ones and
S0018	oh i imagine you could network like crazy in place like that
S0007	and i i think there's er the head office be near there as well and
S0018	mm
S0007	i've never say that i i couldn't see myself forge a career like if i be kind of head of market here
S0018	mhm
S0007	for david lloyd company or like like an impact manager for the food and beverage type thing and if er part of his team like that that'd be something i'd i'd be interest in so
S0018	mhm
S0007	so we'll see but but for now it's just plod on here i host the quiz here
S0018	oh yeah
S0007	so that's why i
S0018	when's that
S0007	so i'm use er do it er every second thursday and every fourth thursday i try to get your mum to come to the last one but i think she go away to
S0018	oh
S0007	they go away so um
S0007	we um do a question of sport quiz so
S0018	she love a question of sport
S0007	so but when er the er how successful it be we're gonna do a sport quiz now every every month as well
S0018	ah cool
S0007	so we do two a month so
S0018	maybe that's something you should do online
S0007	do my own like an online
S0018	yeah
S0018	you know like pagebet and all that all the bet websites they're really take off bingo
S0007	yeah
S0018	you could do like question of sport
S0007	ah that's an idea actually
S0007	oh good stuff
S0018	do you write your own question
S0007	i do not for didn't do it for the question of sport one because that be um i manage to find one on the sport relief website
S0018	uh huh
S0007	um but yeah generally i i kind of i use like some um internet sit that some quiz sit and and just kind of tailor the question to to to the members here cos i they've have a few quizmasters over the years here and i've never think of myself as be a quizmaster but i just think well i know what the members would like to see
S0018	mhm
S0007	and read and like listen out for so i kind of make it like mentally stimulate
S0018	cool
S0007	so
S0018	have you invent your own catchphrase
S0007	not yet i'm
S0007	still work on that
S0007	so er
S0018	you haven't get any er possibles
S0007	i be just try to think of something then um
S0007	no really haven't yet i've i'm i've i think i've er this be i've do seven now er that i've be do i've of the monthly ones so i think perhaps this be the er the end zone now where you you kind of hone in your catchphrase
S0007	so i'll have to think of it
S0007	by next month
S0018	and be er this something that you propose to them or that they
S0007	it be er
S0018	kind of
S0007	it be actually who who
S0018	mm
S0007	he he come up with the idea and i think he run it by who er my manager and she be like oh actually
S0007	and then when i be ask i be like i really don't fancy that cos er just i don't know i just didn't
S0007	didn't think it'd be for me but but i do love it it's one of the best things i do here
S0018	cool
S0007	i think so
S0007	mhm
S0018	so be your manager
S0007	be kind of my opposite in the um tut er upstairs in the in the gym
S0018	uh huh
S0007	he's the um lead coach
S0018	oh okay
S0007	so like 's the sport manager and er oversee obviously all those areas where 's like food and beverage but um yeah 's kind of my my opposite in that sense so
S0018	okay
S0007	but i think er like compare to me like he er cos er as a supervisor i'm i'm i'd like to think i'm i'm very lenient and perhaps they they they take advantage of that whereas they wouldn't dare like take the mick with him
S0018	be he wuh chush
S0007	he no
S0007	he's so friendly and like so like
S0018	mhm
S0007	personable but i think he he kind of draw the the line with them so
S0018	oh right it take a strong personality to be able to do that in a
S0007	mm
S0018	nice
S0007	yeah
S0018	nice way isn't it
S0007	yeah i i salute him for that
S0018	so where be i go to be able to find
S0007	that be a good question um have you see anywhere
S0007	oh he's in a one to one there so
S0018	cool
S0007	there we be no just
S0018	what's a one to one
S0007	just to sit down and chat about he like that's probably what he's do now cos the personal trainers be very much like number base about how many um clients they get and
S0018	mhm
S0007	how much money they can bring in and 's role like he's such a good inspirational person like he'll he will like give them all a lift and give them some good feedback
S0018	ah so he's have a one to one with staff

S0018	and stuff
