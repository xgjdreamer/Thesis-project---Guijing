S0019	er then he say something about everybody who go past and i'm not sure that he know everybody that go past he be say

S0018	i hate it when people
S0019	oh so do i
S0018	speak on their er mobiles really loudly
S0019	mm
S0018	it's
S0019	and i hate it when you're on the bus and they're on their mobile phone and it's i'm on the bus
S0019	yes
S0018	mhm
S0019	urgh
S0018	so do you not think he be just try to chat you up
S0019	mm mm i wouldn't have think so
S0019	at least i desperately hope it wasn't that
S0018	you do get a lot of wierdos in
S0019	mm
S0018	not say only weirdos would try and chat you up but
S0019	thank you dear
S0019	i'm very please you make that clear
S0018	no there be there's always a crazy person walk along ruchi's road shout on his own beat his chest or
S0019	oh my goodness
S0018	yeah
S0019	mm okay
S0018	i think attract them
S0019	well i think 's always be a little bite um of a bohemian place
S0018	mm
S0019	well it's always have that reputation
S0018	yeah but i don't see the connection between bohemian and crazy
S0019	well you often get people who be a little mm challenge will congregate in a less conventional area
S0018	really
S0019	mm
S0018	er
S0019	cos i think they don't feel quite so out of place
S0018	oh i think it be because um a lot of the crazies and i'm not say crazy as a er derogatory term i'm say be people who er do actually have um something wrong with them and
S0019	mm
S0018	for that reason they're shout to the sky they tend to beg on the high street and i think it's because it's such a hub
S0019	mm
S0018	of activity there's always a lot of people there
S0019	mm could be
S0018	i'd assume that it be for that reason
S0019	well i er expect that's part of it but again the people who come to beg in all probability don't live in the area
S0018	mm
S0019	they come into that area because they know the pick be good i think that's er it's like solihull i'm sure we get an awful lot of these eastern european concertina players who really can't play at all uh there be a there be a couple two men a couple of weeks ago i've see them before one play the saxophone and one have a concertina and they be play the same tune
S0019	over and over again
S0018	on three chord
S0019	and it wasn't even quite the right tune
S0019	it be their own variation
S0019	oh dear me
S0018	aw
S0019	it be painful and there's a woman an eastern european woman who play sit and play and she can't play at all she's not play a tune she's just play a random selection of note and it uh
S0018	well
S0019	huh
S0018	i think er they do it so that you pay them to stop play
S0019	yeah it's like the guy with the bagpipes
S0019	he play outside um mark and spencers and it's quite a local joke er people go past and say we're pay you to stop
S0018	aw
S0019	he take it in very good
S0018	aw
S0018	poor lad
S0019	oh dear and he play quite well it's not that he play badly it's just that the bagpipes be not everybody's cup of tea
S0018	a bite of a drone aren't they
S0019	well it's best hear from a distance
S0019	and actually from a distance it's quite a pleasant sound but when it's right up close it isn't a pleasant sound
S0019	unless you're passionately scottish of course and then it doesn't really matter
S0018	well in spain they'd have the gypsies go round
S0019	mm
S0018	um round the streets with their what do you call it the electronic keyboards
S0019	mm
S0018	with the automate
S0019	mm
S0018	rhythms
S0019	yep you get that in
S0018	like the one i have
S0019	yeah you get it in main square
S0018	but they also get a shop trolley and make a sound system
S0018	so they have really loud loud speakers
S0019	uh
S0018	and and it be
S0019	yes
S0018	it's like the
S0018	the automatic er rhythm that i use
S0019	mhm
S0018	to have on my
S0019	mm
S0018	casio keyboard dum de de dum dum
S0019	mm
S0018	dum de de dum dum dum de de dum dum dum and uh that at eight o'clock on sunday morning and you'd get people er
S0018	lean out of their windows throw them coin and say
S0019	just to shut up
S0018	now go
S0019	oh dear talk about eastern europeans and beg do you remember when you be in paris and we come to see you and we be outside the eiffel tower and those gang
S0018	mhm
S0019	of beggar
S0018	mhm
S0019	the children they be all filthy dirty as well and i'm not sure whether that be do deliberately to gain sympathy
S0018	well anyone who have to resort to beg would get my sympathy i don't know whether they'd get my money
S0019	mm
S0018	but they'd get my sympathy
S0019	well the problem be that over here beg have become a profession it's not they don't do it because they have to do it
S0018	er no but be that through necessity cos they can't get a job
S0019	no because it's the easy option they can earn as much money mm depend on where they go in a day than they could earn in an ordinary job
S0018	well i'm not
S0019	they don't pay any tax
S0018	well i'm sure that there's a lot of people who be beg that would prefer to have a job
S0019	well i haven't do a survey so i wouldn't know but it be quite common that they earn considerably more than they would do do a er minimum wage job
S0018	mm
S0019	and of course they don't pay tax and but they still qualify they they qualify for benefit they still get benefit seem a crazy system to me but hey what do i know
S0018	well with a minimum wage job not be able to pay er for a live not to be not be huh not be a live wage i'm not surprise that people take other avenues to get the money that they need to live er and then get a bite cheeky
S0019	but there be people who do live on er on the minimum wage
S0018	well i doubt they er make end meet very comfortably
S0019	well most people who be on minimum wage qualify for benefit as well so it's not they're not totally dependent on
S0018	hm
S0019	and especially if they've get children and very often they will get house allowance and things like that which make their rent much more affordable
S0018	hm what be the minimum wage then
S0019	huh i think now it's about it's six pound something an hour
S0018	blimey
S0019	or seven pound an hour something like that
S0018	so what would that be like in a yearly figure if you
S0019	um puh depend on how many hours a week you work
S0018	like if er if you're work full time hours
S0019	if you're work a forty hour week which be about two hundred and eighty pound a week say three hundred for the sake of argument that's twelve hundred a month so it's about fourteen thousand a year and as i say it depend on your individual circumstances
S0018	mm
S0019	but there be um so people get house benefit and other benefit as well income support various other bits and piece dependent on circumstances you can't it's not a blanket thing at all i mean we at the court we only get about a pound an hour more than the minimum wage
S0018	yep yep
S0019	you know
S0018	well it's like
S0019	so
S0018	teach assistants
S0019	mm
S0018	they can be work full time and be
S0019	mm
S0018	get pay fifteen grand
S0019	mm but there be huh there be lot of job that pay that much
S0018	that little
S0019	or that little whichever way you want to look at it
S0018	mm
S0019	so but then when you think back to what you be get pay in spain
S0018	yeah but that be by no mean minimum wage because there be people on about half of what i be on
S0019	mm but compare to minimum wage earn and what you be earn
S0018	mm
S0019	there's not much difference be there
S0018	yeah but you can't really make those comparisons across culture
S0019	mm i don't know i'd be interest to know what um language teachers in the similar school to yours in this country be be pay
S0018	well they're not be pay a fix er er rate because i don't think there be many post that be year round
S0019	no
S0018	permanent
S0019	no
S0018	full time
S0019	but then yours wasn't be it really
S0018	they get out of employ you on a permanent basis by make you
S0019	mm
S0018	by because of the holiday over the summer
S0019	mm yeah so but i don't know but we've never consider um usher us usher that we're pay an awful lot i mean laura be a full time senior usher and i think she be on about seventeen thousand
S0018	yep
S0019	so the court service be not hugely pay
S0018	but it would be fine if people didn't have to fork out so much for accommodation
S0019	mm
S0018	i really do believe that
S0019	and you pay less in on a mortgage than you do in rent provide you can stump up enough of a deposit
S0018	yeah
S0019	that's the ridiculous part about it and because people can't buy house as easily as they use to be able to extra pressure on the rental market so the landlords hike the rent
S0018	yep it's not fair
S0019	it isn't fair
S0018	but hey
S0019	but unfortunately it's the law of supply and demand isn't it
S0018	no it's
S0019	be you limp
S0018	it's the er
S0019	be you limp
S0018	it's the cheekiness of some people to to er hike rent up
S0019	mm
S0018	and hike price up just because they can
S0019	mm well it's like the holiday industry that hike price in the school holiday because they know that a lot of people can only go in the school holiday so we hike the price there's no economic reason for it other than they know that a lot of people have to take their holiday in that time
S0018	well it's even more it's even worse when you're talk about house because shelter be suppose to be one of the human right so if you've get people make profit out of
S0019	mm
S0018	house people i just don't think that's right
S0019	but then on the other hand people have buy house have mortgage have to pay the mortgage so they have to charge rent to cover the mortgage they can't do it any other way unless you've get a spare
S0018	mm
S0019	three hundred thousand quid to to spend
S0018	what be your scenario again i didn't catch that er
S0019	that the people who have buy the house that people rent or the flats that people rent
S0018	uh huh
S0019	have probably buy them on mortgage
S0018	mm
S0019	so they've get to pay the mortgage so they have to pay they have the tenant have to pay the mortgage cost
S0018	so while this other guy be live comfortably in his own little house
S0019	because
S0018	why why should he
S0019	but he's still get
S0018	be able to make a profit out of
S0019	well he's he's still get overheads he's still get repair upkeep insurance
S0018	yeah fair enough
S0019	all that sort of thing
S0018	fair enough
S0019	well it's like any business you go into a business with the idea of make profit
S0018	yeah er what i'm say be that er house shouldn't be for profit
S0019	unfortunately
S0018	so it should be divorce
S0019	everything's for profit
S0018	yeah i know that's the problem
S0019	that's life
S0018	i just think it should be divorce from the idea of business there shouldn't be businesses that be make a profit from house people because they'll they'll always start hike price up to make more profit and that's just
S0019	tis in the nature of the beast unfortunately
S0018	well they need to put some restrictions and regulations in place cos i'm sure the people who rent out their house and make profit they're yeah yeah but i should be able to do that it's my it's my right it's my house i can rent it out it's yeah fair enough but when you're create the problem of hike price up and make tut you know make
S0019	mm
S0018	people homeless because they can't afford to to live in a marketplace house
S0019	i would be interest to know how much the how much profit the and the make on their house cos they rent out house to students
S0018	really
S0019	mm no i'd be very interest to know
S0018	again that need to be change as well that should be university run because the university last year um source it out to another company
S0019	mm
S0018	who be run all the student accommodation for profit because it's a business
S0019	mm
S0018	and all of a sudden the refuse collection be cut to once every two weeks and i mean once every two weeks you can imagine
S0019	mm
S0018	with like twenty students for each bin no even more because there be three house so thirty students for each bin and the bin be only collect once every fortnight it be disgust and you start get rat
S0019	mm
S0018	around and
S0019	mm
S0018	instead of have um a very basic but free internet connection
S0019	mm
S0018	they they again outsource the internet to another company who come in and put super rapid quick fire amaze internet in but then charge you
S0019	mm
S0018	per person fifteen quid um
S0019	how often fifteen quid
S0018	a month
S0019	per month
S0018	yeah per person
S0019	oo
S0018	so you're think if if ten students sign up for it in one house
S0019	mm
S0018	you know they're rake in a hundred and fifty on what they would in
S0019	mhm
S0018	a normal house probably only thirty or forty
S0019	mm
S0018	so it just become for everything be for profit
S0019	mm
S0018	you know where be the whole ethos
S0019	but i'm
S0018	of
S0019	yeah unfortunately universities now don't have the fund to do what they use to do
S0018	mm
S0019	i mean when you think back to when i be at college we pay nothing no tuition fee no board and lodge the education authority pay for all that but there be only a fraction of the number of pupils go to university or colleges as there be now
S0018	yeah
S0019	you know er you you can't have it both ways unfortunately
S0018	yep
S0019	but i i still feel that universities should go back to be centre of academic excellence
S0018	i agree
S0019	and have far more vocational course um because the majority not the majority but a large number of the people that they're send to university shouldn't be there so they have mickey mouse degrees that be worth absolutely nothing doesn't enable them to get job and saddle them with a mountain of debt where's the logic in that
S0018	there be none
S0019	it's ridiculous i'm still make up my mind to write to
S0018	oh
S0019	michael gove
S0019	i'm think about it in my oo the other thing i've get to do as well be to write my um account of miss lakka for the tomahawk newsletter
S0018	what
S0019	you remember when we go sail and we be go to go to lakka on paxos
S0018	uh huh
S0019	and normally he will navigate us everywhere
S0018	mhm
S0019	but this time he say no no no we'll see it and have do a six hour complete circumnavigation of paxos
S0019	because we miss lakka um it be rather daunt experience so i we i mean it we laugh about it now
S0018	oh so it's not a letter of complaint it's a
S0019	no no no this be my account of
S0018	oh i think you say it be a letter
S0019	oh no no no no no no my account of how we miss lakka we go afterwards and it be a very pretty place
S0018	be it on paxos
S0019	mm
S0018	then how come you miss it
S0019	well it's get a very narrow entrance and then open out into this big harbour type thing
S0018	mm
S0019	and the very narrow entrance be not easy to see um unless you're very close to it and it didn't look like an entrance
S0019	it just look like rock and things so we miss it
S0019	and i be get decidedly panicky because once you get round the tip of the island the terrain change it's sheer side um rock absolutely nowhere to stop and all i want to do be to get off the bloody boat
S0019	i just want to get off
S0018	so be you go to do it again this year
S0019	not in the same sort of boat no and i'm not sure whether the little motor boat it would be a good idea to go round that far
S0018	oh be he only get a motor boat this year
S0019	yes yeah because the proper boat be a little bite expensive
S0018	mm
S0019	so we're have the the villa melissa for two weeks and then he can hire a little motor boat
S0018	oh last time do you stay on the boat all the time
S0019	for one week yes
S0018	oh
S0019	we have a boat for a week and then a villa for the week
S0018	oh
S0019	that be when we be in talenti's house which be fantastic place right on the water he's limp again
S0018	aw
S0019	right on the water and you have somewhere to moor your motorboat so you could you could hire it for a week but i guess we can do the same we just have to go and fetch it and take it back every day cos there isn't anywhere cos we're slightly up above the the coast but it'll be fine
S0018	you'll have some fun
S0019	i just want to go away
S0018	sorry
S0019	i just want to go away
S0018	when be you go
S0019	june fourth just want to go where
S0018	miaow
S0019	i can't be get at and don't have to be concern with anybody else
S0019	huh
S0018	well you could do that here you could just er
S0019	oh no i can't
S0018	yes you can
S0019	no i can't
S0018	just pretend that you've go away
S0019	no i'm contactable unfortunately
S0018	well you could always switch your phone off and just not answer the telephone and say i've go away
S0019	yeah but people know i'm here people know i'm here
S0018	how they don't have spy out
S0019	oh they do somebody else i think of who probably would
S0018	mhm
S0019	do be um tut angie from work
S0018	okay
S0019	she's a very interest person cos she be a senior police officer
S0018	oh
S0019	it's funny cos some of the the police officer who come to court they still call her ma'am
S0018	cos they know her
S0019	yeah as er a senior police officer
S0018	ah
S0019	and of course they call all the senior police ladies ma'am
S0019	cos she be a chief inspector quite er high up
S0018	yeah well if she's up for it i'm quite happy to
S0019	so i will contact her and
S0018	have to behave myself
S0018	for the duration of an hour
S0019	cos they live in hampton in arden
S0018	ah
S0019	which be not that far away it's i think i know where she live
S0018	so why do she work at the court
S0019	because she retire from the police when she be fifty five
S0018	do she get bore
S0019	no she meet cos she hadn't be marry
S0018	mhm

S0018	mhm
S0019	and then they get marry
S0018	mhm
S0019	er and she decide that she'd get to fifty and the police can retire early much earlier than most people so she decide she would retire and enjoy marry life and then i think she's get a bite bore
S0018	that's what i mean yeah
S0019	um so she work three days a week
S0018	yep
S0019	but she's retire from that later on this year so
S0018	have enough now
S0019	well you know she say there's time to do other things and her father have just die as well and i think

S0019	he be quite a a tie
S0018	mhm
S0019	um and she have a sister whose husband die very recently um very young so cos her sister's quite a lot younger than she be and i think he be only forty seven or something like that

S0019	no but they're they're read out in the court proceed
S0018	oh right
S0019	i think fff
S0018	er yeah so she ask me to write him a witness statement to testify to his good character
S0019	but huh what them charge him with her murder
S0018	i don't know i can't work it out i've read all the police report that have be er that they publish on their blog um it's quite quite transparent
S0019	be this in in spain
S0018	no in france
S0019	in france
S0018	it happen in france
S0019	fff mm
S0018	and there be no there's no um tut no evidence of accelerants on his clothe on his hand on the car on the body on he be in er he be in the pizza place er phone the police to report her miss at the time when another three or four witness say that they saw a a fire bolt a fire er le le le le
S0019	mm
S0018	what do you call it a
S0019	explosion

S0018	and so he be actually on the phone to the police at the time give by three independent witness say that they saw this huge explosion
S0019	how long have she be miss
S0018	well he'd organize to meet her two hours before
S0019	and she hadn't turn up

S0019	mind you you see they could argue mind you if they didn't find anything on the car no evidence of an explosive device how the hell can they say he he he do it
S0018	well it's crazy then they
S0019	mind you the french judicial system be
S0018	well they're

S0018	yeah yeah and also what's worse for be that they've take cos obviously they question her before she'd see her father or know her
S0019	mm
S0018	mother have die and they er they be say what be it like at home last night um and she say oh er mummy be upset because she'd drop the remote control of the tv and she couldn't fix it back together and she get a bite upset which
S0018	you know if you ask an eleven year old what happen last night oh yeah mum drop the mum drop the remote remote control she couldn't she couldn't work out how to put it back together she be a bite
S0019	yeah i um
S0018	not
S0019	yeah
S0018	well er she use the word upset
S0019	yes mm
S0018	it doesn't mean that
S0019	i hope
S0018	and so they use that her say that it have no reference to her father it have no reference to anything um
S0019	so they use that as a cause
S0018	they use that
S0019	for him
S0018	no they use that as evidence that they have be argue where she didn't even mention an argument she just say
S0019	but she didn't mention that her father be there
S0018	not even no
S0019	do they ask her whether her father be there
S0018	i have no idea but it's what i
S0019	i i hope they have um an appropriate adult with the child but then i don't know what the rule be in france but here you cannot i um tut interview er a youth without an appropriate adult
S0018	mm well er at that point in time i don't know how good her french be cos they'd only be live there for two years
S0019	jeepers
S0018	and she be eleven
S0019	and he's be in prison all this time
S0018	no he get um tut he spend four years in prison right after it happen and then i don't know i don't understand the situation he get let out um i think there's two type of court and you get put through two like er a civil and a criminal charge and so the original civil charge he have to serve x amount of years in prison but now er it's a criminal charge cos they change it from manslaughter to premeditate murder
S0019	pff
S0018	and
S0019	dear god
S0018	i think it be last september
S0019	hm
S0018	there be a er he go to court and and they didn't they didn't um acquit him
S0019	you see in
S0018	oh i don't understand
S0019	france it's not the police who be er responsible for bring charge it's um tut can't remember the name but he's actually a lawyer
S0018	yeah
S0019	he's not a police officer
S0018	medico legal like the er equivalent of a coroner
S0019	no um it's a lawyer who decide whether somebody should be charge or not take it away from the investigate officer and the police force in france will investigate they will give their evidence to this person i can't remember what his name be tut there be a name and he be the one that decide whether charge should be bring now he's not a police officer he's a lawyer
S0018	mm
S0019	and it just strike me that it's not huh i think there be more chance of mistake be make that way
S0018	well this be a huge mistake
S0019	you're not kid
S0018	i mean they've get no evidence whatsoever that give him a motive or um
S0019	opportunity
S0018	yeah exactly er it just seem really strange he seem to think that because you know he be um
S0019	yeah mm
S0018	he be a businessman
S0019	in russian mafia
S0018	in uzbekistan and they end up leave because
S0019	mm
S0018	he couldn't do business freely
S0019	mm
S0018	it be all he be always visit by the mafia
S0019	mm
S0018	and they always make it very difficult for him to operate cleanly
S0019	mm
S0018	and so that be the motivation behind him leave and so he think that it's retribution for that
S0019	but even so how could they have do it without trace of accelerant or explosives or anything else
S0018	no idea
S0019	i mean how else do they explain the fact that the car explode
S0018	they haven't they haven't explain it but they're not try to look for alternative explanations
S0019	no they've they've get him and that's all they're interest in
S0018	because they're just interest in point the finger at him and
S0019	you see over here that would've go to forensics and they would've go over that car with a fine tooth comb to try and identify
S0018	hm
S0019	exactly what the cause of the explosion be i i i would like to think they would've do the same in france but
S0018	well i'm sure they would've do but
S0019	you never know do you but again they have to have some sort of explanation for it you can't just say oh well it explode we can't find anything but he must've do it
S0018	well exactly that that be the
S0019	you can't do that
S0018	the logic behind it or the illogic behind it
S0019	well yeah no it doesn't make any sense at all and who decide the appeal
S0018	well he er he can appeal against
S0019	yeah he appeal but who decide the result of the appeal
S0018	i don't know i don't know if it's jury
S0019	be it the judge
S0018	or
S0019	no i suspect it'd be a judge
S0018	really
S0019	cos that's usually what happen here but that's france and i don't know what the system be there
S0018	hm
S0019	but that's terrible poor girl so she's what now eighteen now
S0018	nineteen
S0019	nineteen be she still in france
S0018	yep
S0019	have she get other relatives
S0018	um not outside of russia she get the the day the day after it happen um she get whisk off and put in a foster family
S0019	bloody hell
S0018	which luckily i think be a really nice family
S0019	yeah
S0018	and have
S0019	yeah
S0018	have be able to keep her for all
S0019	mm
S0018	you know from when she be eleven to when she be eighteen
S0019	but what a traumatic experience for the poor girl
S0018	but not only lose your mother in
S0019	mm
S0018	such a freak accident or whatever it be
S0019	you lose your father as well pff
S0018	then your father be be take away from you just at the time when you need him
S0019	mm
S0018	most and
S0019	mm
S0018	imprison with no
S0019	mm
S0018	for no reason i just don't er
S0019	have she be able to see her father while he's be in prison
S0018	i think they've have um they've be allow to have one visit every month
S0019	dear god one visit a month
S0018	even when he's be out of prison he's only be like allow to visit her once a month
S0019	good grief
S0018	and he's in an awful situation cos even
S0019	poor girl
S0018	when he's out of prison he doesn't have he have no paper so he's an illegal because they've they've revoke
S0019	they've take oh
S0018	his visa and everything
S0019	mm
S0018	but he's not allow to leave france er until the whole hear
S0019	mm
S0018	have finish so he's in this completely
S0019	how do he support himself though
S0018	well that's the thing he can't cos he can't work he have they've take away his paper um his drive licence his passport everything they won't give them back to him but he's an illegal
S0019	mm
S0018	now
S0019	mm
S0018	cos they've revoke his um status
S0019	but where do that leave her
S0018	well now she's like independent cos she's over eighteen and she's at university and she live with her boyfriend and
S0019	but they haven't take her ability to to live there visa passport everything else
S0018	no i don't know what happen along those line
S0019	so if he's if they then decide that he's not guilty presumably he get all that back one assume
S0018	well i should bloody hope so
S0019	one assume have they have the press involve in france i wonder
S0018	well i've see cos 's compile a blog at the moment
S0019	mm
S0018	with all these witness testimonials and it er media coverage of it
S0019	mm
S0018	but there doesn't seem to be a lot of there seem to be quite a lot of article but they all seem to be say the same thing and they don't seem to actually be investigate it's just more sensationalist
S0019	mm
S0018	oo this man have be duddle luddle luddle luh
S0019	mm
S0018	and the lack oh sensationalist no not sensationalist but just there to amuse people as oppose to
S0019	it's not investigative journalism
S0018	no
S0019	no mm but then again i don't know what the the press do in france whether they're like our press that do a lot of i know you you hate them but they do
S0018	the daily hate
S0019	do a lot of um investigative journalism and try to change things like over gary tut mckinnon you know the one who's asperger's who the americans want to deport and send him to prison for sixty years for supposedly do something which occur in this country and be not an offence in this country and they've do a lot of campaign to try and get the government to put a stop to it
S0018	and have it work
S0019	well he still hasn't be deport this have be go on now for two years
S0018	hm
S0019	and still he's not be deport
S0018	mm
S0019	but why we sign up to this treaty with the americans and this european arrest warrant business there's a case in the paper today a guy who be accuse of um assault on a tourist um they've suppose to have throw him over a sea wall and he end up paralyse
S0018	oh my life
S0019	but he be arrest he and his friend be arrest but the descriptions that the victim give of the people who attack him be nothing like these two so they be allow to go now there's be this european arrest warrant from portugal say even though the guy
S0018	mm
S0019	didn't die they want him for murder
S0018	do this happen in portugal
S0019	yep
S0018	uh
S0019	but the guy didn't die but they still want him on the arrest warrant it's for murder
S0018	er the guy who wait there the guy that be who be let off because the victim
S0019	mm
S0018	describe
S0019	completely different people now seventeen years later
S0018	they want
S0019	they want
S0018	ow
S0019	this one guy only
S0018	the one that er be this er one of the guy that be originally arrest
S0019	mhm
S0018	for it
S0019	but only one of them they want him back after seventeen years and the charge on the arrest warrant be murder
S0018	and do the guy die
S0019	no
S0018	in the end
S0019	no
S0018	he's still alive
S0019	he's still alive
S0018	tut
S0019	so how can they possibly
S0018	mm
S0019	want him for murder when the guy's not dead it make no sense at all and but because there be this european arrest warrant we've get to comply with it and ship him out they don't have to provide any proof of anything
S0018	hm
S0019	it just seem a bite lopsided to me
S0018	it do but then again
S0019	and then you look at
S0018	be the daily mail report the facts
S0019	no no no this
S0018	facts
S0019	no no no no no no
S0018	between speech mark
S0019	no it's in the telegraph as well so it can't all be wrong
S0018	oo
S0019	but the the way the portuguese police handle the madeleine mccann
S0018	yeah no that be awful
S0019	you know and you just wonder what the police service in the in portugal be like i i urgh it make you well greece be the same their police be less than huh what shall we say honest that's probably the wrong word to use but it seem whether we look at our judiciary through rise tint spectacles or not i don't know but it seem to me that our system be fairer and less open to corruption
S0018	mm
S0019	than many others
S0018	hm
S0019	but huh i just
S0018	no i've hear the french legal system criticize before
S0019	mm
S0018	but i don't know upon
S0019	mm
S0018	what ground i don't know enough about it
S0019	i think it be because um the police have no involvement other than the investigation and all the evidence be then send to this judge i think it be um and he decide what should happen
S0018	oh wait there wait there wait there have you read you've read the kay scarpetta novels haven't you
S0019	yep
S0018	patricia cornwell
S0019	mhm
S0018	isn't there's one that take place in paris
S0019	be there
S0018	yeah when they catch the wolf man
S0019	i don't think i've read that one
S0018	haven't you
S0019	don't think so doesn't ring any bell
S0018	now i've get a feel that it's the equivalent of the kay scarpetta american woman her equivalent in paris who be in charge of put the case together not prepare the evidence but actually judge the case
S0019	well in kay scarpetta's novels the the what's her face be the medical examiner
S0018	yep
S0019	which be not the same thing at all
S0018	that's my point
S0019	she she provide the the medical evidence
S0018	mhm
S0019	and the forensic evidence
S0018	mhm but that's my point and wasn't it the same with um when they be investigate er princess diana's death that there be some criticism of um the people who be investigate it be the same people who be gonna put the case together
S0019	well that's usually that's what happen here
S0018	judge the case
S0019	oh i don't know about judge the case
S0018	sorry
S0019	i i don't know i just all i think all european judicial systems work on a very different system to ours
S0018	hm ow cat that hurt
S0019	isn't it france that it's call the napoleonic code
S0018	i have no idea
S0019	i think
S0019	i'm not absolutely sure
S0018	i might look into it
S0019	mm but hm he have a lawyer presumably
S0018	yes i think he's find a pro bono lawyer
S0019	mm
S0018	but at least he's get some support
S0019	mm
S0018	but i really don't know any detail
S0019	no
S0018	i've only have very sporadic and short contact with them
S0019	mm what a terrible position to be in
S0018	it be
S0019	now it beg the question if they agree his appeal then do they pay him compensation
S0018	well they bloody should and i really hope that
S0019	mm
S0018	i hope that that be what happen because he's
S0019	it's not fair
S0018	destitute
S0019	yeah
S0018	now
S0019	yeah
S0018	if they do acquit him you know he's
S0019	well look at the thousands of pound they pay to the um pub bombers when they decide that they weren't guilty at all
S0018	mm
S0019	and they'd spend god know how long in prison but again it's the french system and i don't understand how it work
S0018	mm
S0019	i'm begin to wonder whether the french know how it work i just find that appal that they can do that
S0018	easy tiger shh
S0018	she hasn't even come close to you
S0019	no but
S0018	stop it
S0019	she's here in the room
S0018	stop it
S0019	shh
S0019	silly girl
S0018	yeah so it must be different but i just don't know in what respect be it different
S0019	i don't know the difference the two i don't know enough of the difference between the two systems
S0019	but i oh do shush
S0018	i don't know
S0019	no i er mm
S0018	what kind of code be it here
S0019	er i don't think we have a a name for it
S0018	mm
S0019	no the huh i'm not sure whether the napoleonic code refer to the way um estates be inherit um cos there's a difference to how things be hand down between france and us
S0018	yeah
S0019	i think in france it have to be distribute amongst everybody where we have i don't know there be some i wonder if it say in the dictionary
S0018	well i i be just think oh i wish i have my laptop i be like i don't need a laptop
S0018	i've get a smartphone now
S0019	oh of course i'd forget all about that it would never occur to me to use a phone for that
S0018	what would it be french justice system
S0019	um
S0018	or penal code
S0019	i
S0018	or
S0019	oo french justice system i guess mm but huh it's i'm look for aren't i no no it doesn't actually say just give the basic reference to napoleon and napoleonic oh that's interest napoleon be a gold twenty franc piece or a nineteenth century high boot
S0018	okay unlike english speak countries which use the system of common law france have a system of civil law whatever that mean
S0019	yeah how do you mm
S0018	oh common law systems have evolve over the age civil law systems be largely base on a code of law
S0019	which mean what
S0018	i don't know
S0019	that doesn't really help us very much do it cos it doesn't really explain what this code be uh no i think you'd have to do a lot more investigation
S0018	but you're right about napoleon though it say um the basis of the legal system be lay out in a document know as know as the civil code er or the napoleonic code
S0019	mm i know there be something about napoleon in it
S0018	there be other cod include the penal code which define criminal law
S0019	yep which be what we have
S0018	yeah so you've also get public law and private law
S0019	i think we call that civil law
S0018	you see i think that's why he have to have two different um tut tribunals what do you call them
S0019	yeah
S0018	court appearances
S0019	yeah
S0018	one for er civil and one for penal oh i don't know
S0019	jeepers yeah it's ridiculous a systematic collection of statutes a body of laws so arrange as to avoid inconsistency and overlap well that system would seem to overlap cos you're do the same two different uh two different hear that cover pretty much the same evidence but then when you think all crimes go through our magistrates' court
S0018	all crimes do
S0019	yep murder will go through the magistrates' court the defendant will only be ask to give his name and date of birth and then it's immediately commit to the crown court
S0018	hm oh it's always um mostly always preside over by judge
S0019	mm
S0018	in court what's in assize court
S0019	the assize court
S0018	assize what's a
S0019	be
S0018	what's an assize court
S0019	um it's wuh it's a sort of next stage up um er no assize court now assize court be something slightly different i think or be it what we call now the crown court
S0018	i have no idea
S0019	no oh it's double s isn't it assize assize assize court sit at intervals in each county of england and wales to administer the civil and criminal law so it's our crown court
S0018	be that a local court as oppose to a national court
S0019	it's you've get the the the magistrates' court which and every sort of big town have its own magistrates' court and then things that be too serious to be deal with in the magistrates' court go up to the crown court
S0018	oh okay
S0019	and our crown court be in
S0018	oh right yeah yeah yeah
S0019	and then there's another one in um warwick
S0018	mhm
S0019	well it be in warwick it's now in leamington but it's call warwick crown court
S0018	mhm
S0019	so it go in bigger areas
S0018	i see
S0019	but it be what we use to call the assize court be but the difference now be it's not sit at intervals they sit all the time
S0018	hm hm
S0019	because i think that's probably a bite of an out of date title
S0018	i don't understand all this stuff that's i don't understand the word that they're use to explain the word that i don't understand
S0019	well it be pass from the old french feminine past participle of aseeir sit at
S0018	oh
S0019	from the latin assidere so there
S0018	you learn something new every day don't you
S0019	you certainly do the fact that it'll be forget in five minutes have get nothing to do with it
S0018	maybe it would be more informative look at penal code
S0019	well i think the penal code be just the um sort of sentence for different crimes
S0018	oh really
S0019	i think so
S0018	it's on how the process of how that be
S0019	no
S0018	go about
S0019	no i don't think so i mean check it and see i would be surprise but it's possible no i think our er penal code be just the oops be just the the different crimes and how they be treat
S0018	yeah like categorize offences
S0019	mm
S0018	hm well i don't know i have no idea how you'd look up what the process of
S0019	i've no idea either
S0018	the the whole judgement process
S0019	i suppose you could google the er french judicial system that would give you some information
S0018	ah the judicial system
S0019	mhm
S0018	as oppose to the legal system of course yeah
S0019	mm
S0018	pardon me
S0019	but you'd want it specifically for france because they're all so different
S0018	french
S0018	it's just
S0019	i don't think so
S0018	oh it's so difficult to hunt and peck the letter
S0018	with this thumb that doesn't work properly let's see what it say tut it's not say a great deal at the moment
S0019	yeah
S0019	yeah
S0018	oh look she's go asleep in the sun
S0019	soppy cat

S0019	er by and large yes um because most people tend to like um and and and they all text message they don't phone you unless there's a
S0018	yep
S0019	er they need an answer now sort of thing um but it's all text message
S0018	yep
S0019	and i'm not convince that that's a good idea
S0018	well i think it be in a way because you don't have to rely on that other person be
S0019	no
S0018	available
S0019	no
S0018	to communicate at er
S0019	no
S0018	precisely the moment that you'd wanna
S0019	but it also tend to increase the number of message you send because they'll send a message and you'll reply to the message and then they'll reply to the message
S0019	and it you know it's sort of self perpetuate circle of message
S0019	drive you round the bend
S0018	which could be deal with in
S0019	yeah
S0018	a short phone conversation
S0019	on a phone call yeah exactly
S0018	yeah i actually prefer text message though cos the amount of time it take me to knock out a text message isn't actually
S0019	no
S0018	that much
S0019	no
S0018	so i don't mind
S0019	no
S0018	i actually prefer text message i don't like speak on the phone especially when tut i don't mind speak on the phone but when people expect you to pick the phone up at all time
S0019	mm
S0018	like when you're in the supermarket or when you're
S0019	mm
S0018	just come out of work or
S0019	mm
S0018	and you just don't have it in your head to be able to
S0019	no
S0018	make arrangements or something
S0019	mm
S0018	i just
S0019	but i always work on the principle that if it's important enough they'll phone back
S0019	you know and if it's not important enough it didn't matter in the first place
S0018	these screen get so
S0019	yeah
S0018	dirty as well
S0019	but
S0018	especially if you wear make up
S0019	before we have mobile phone and we weren't instantly contactable we manage
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0019	you know it it's it's very rarely that you need to have immediate contact with somebody
S0018	yep
S0019	in a business situation i suppose i can understand it but most social occasion you don't need to have instant communication
S0018	mm
