S0024	you get too soft don't you about it all
S0144	yeah
S0024	like without keep remind yourself about what you could do to to help it not happen so much yeah you need to read read read cos i know i know what to do but it's just difficult when you look at her cute little face
S0144	yeah but we're not gonna spoil her
S0024	she's already spoil
S0144	well
S0024	be you be you spoil be you spoil be you spoil yeah i think that's a yeah
S0144	i dunno i don't think she's gonna be attention grab be she

S0144	yeah
S0024	er this rice be one of the first things that they try cos nobody have any allergies to rice you and you put it in and you just make really thick rice porridge and you can put them all in ice cub in the in the freezer and
S0144	put the rice porridge as ice cub
S0024	well just put them in ice cube we need to buy ice cube trays
S0144	oh
S0024	load and load of ice cube things i be gonna get them from home just cos metro might have them could go to metro
S0144	i've look before

S0024	day and afternoon might be nice for her for her to see if see if she sit in it okay i think but she would she sit in it's the same
S0144	it's the same one
S0024	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah i think she's gonna start to get more expensive now because she wasn't she hasn't really be very expensive yet have she i mean yeah we've get the pram and yeah quite a few things actually
S0144	why's she gonna get expensive
S0024	cos we need the nice high chair there's gonna be the playpen the
S0144	that's it isn't it
S0024	well
S0144	that's it until she go to university
S0024	we'll just keep her in the playpen wanna stay in the playpen she'll have to have a a nap now
S0144	you gonna put her in the other room
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah it's five o'clock so if we give her well if we wanna make her go to sleep at seven
S0024	and she would go to sleep at seven if she have her nap now
S0144	it's get later and later she start off great with the sleep you know
S0024	yeah but these nap daytime nap be mess up at the moment too
S0144	mm yeah but it's
S0024	but
S0144	all because of the trip
S0024	be it
S0024	cos i out most of the day and she be nicely asleep at erm 's house but her two year old basically her up cos sorry sorry everybody be you know we be talk and the two year old be run about so you know she have a nice quiet sleep
S0144	mm
S0024	but she only sleep for twenty minutes and she should've sleep a good hour best i don't take her out again but if she get overtire she maybe we can get in bed by eight
S0144	mm that'd be good
S0024	she can come and watch us cook dinner or something but if we get the high chair she can watch us cook dinner she can sit in our high chair that'd be that'd be something new to dream about cos she's already get
S0144	oh while she's get a high chair she can watch me make music
S0024	yeah she can sit there it's it's really good but she can have toy on there like it's a nice nice thing to sit on i think think it have strap it need strap doesn't it otherwise
S0144	surely it's get strap hasn't it
S0024	yeah cos
S0144	all high chair have get strap haven't they
S0024	just wonder why the strap on that recliner chair why they don't hold her in why she pull out of that
S0144	well cos she start lean forward what you mean why you can't
S0024	with the high chair
S0144	erm well i think the centre of gravity on that thing be a bite weird
S0024	mm
S0144	high chair's gonna be a lot sturdier cos it's four legs
S0024	but she fall out of that forward so i don't get it
S0144	yeah cos it's like a rock horse isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	it's only get one point touch the floor
S0024	mm
S0144	you gonna go and put her down
S0024	yeah wait for her to finish
S0024	oh
S0024	oh shh
S0024	it's okay shh oh it's okay yeah she's gonna have a little nap
S0144	okay
