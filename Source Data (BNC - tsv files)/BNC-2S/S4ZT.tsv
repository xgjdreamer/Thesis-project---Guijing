S0262	who don't want to go and hang out with a bunch of twenty year olds and do an mba or whatever you know they want to learn
S0261	they're they want to change
S0262	they want to change
S0261	cos they need to be able to work it out for themselves
S0262	find an environment exactly that suit them
S0261	rather than yeah
S0262	at the age of forty
S0261	and their time on their on their term
S0262	yeah your patience level go fuck out the window basically you know you've get to have what you want you time's too short life's too short to fuck around with people in tutorials who don't fuck do their group work you know that's the point
S0261	so i mean one one interest thing be be we're probably as a as a generation in in the middle of where all the change be yeah
S0262	we be we're i feel it
S0261	and and and
S0262	we're right in the middle of it and you're
S0261	it's not it's not just what you're talk about it's in a generic sense baby boomers at the top
S0262	right
S0261	go out the door
S0262	right
S0261	then you've get the young ones at the bottom who be actually those two generations be miles apart
S0262	oh
S0261	and we're in the middle of it
S0262	yeah
S0261	get the mix of it
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and sometimes you'll get some of us be of the older generation some of us be younger and a lot of us be actually a mix and so if you look at like education and the way that things have be teach through society now don't expect to be do the same job for the whole of your life
S0262	fuck no look right okay look when we
S0261	so let me just finish let me just finish
S0262	yeah okay
S0261	erm so so the reason why i'm bring that up be because what i'm do and that kind of example be in the middle of it it be i'm in the middle of it i'm try to change so i'm try to adopt this younger approach but in fact i've probably be bring up in the older world
S0262	yeah you have
S0261	so try that's what i mean about the try to unlearn stuff and disconnect from some of that channel stuff that you've have in your past that you need to explore things differently and try to learn them differently and and approach things very differently i mean you know there be case we work on things for bugger all like you've do in your past with your production and stuff like that to try and get place that you offer things for
S0262	absolutely
S0261	whatever
S0262	absolutely
S0261	for gratis
S0262	absolutely
S0261	on return for something else some experience some exposure later on
S0262	i completely agree with you and i i think that all of those things you've just say be completely valid and i actually think that there be that many nearly forty year olds yeah go about it in the way that you're try to achieve what you're try to achieve there be two people who stick out in my mind that you know very well one of them be and the other one be
S0261	mm mm
S0262	be some sort of erm
S0261	well he be a mechanical
S0262	be he mechanical
S0261	no no be a engineer
S0262	be he
S0261	yeah
S0262	right okay i didn't know that okay so hard core engineer
S0261	mm
S0262	turn himself into a plumber yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	okay career shift he do it
S0262	yeah he he manage it okay
S0261	mm
S0262	do it just in time for his family good idea
S0261	yeah
S0262	and his wife
S0261	mm
S0262	they try to give it a go with the juice bar thing that's tough yeah it's hard they give they
S0261	and that obviously work out they didn't wanna work in their nine to five job etcetera and do
S0262	when we be when we be with them in india they want to actually open a b and b
S0261	yeah
S0262	it's actually what they want to do they didn't do that though they actually open a juice bar
S0261	because they work out it wasn't gonna be a viable business plan or whatever
S0262	whatever but as far as i know 's go back to something quite similar to what he be do before
S0261	mm
S0262	i mean have always be a teacher so that's fine you know
S0261	right
S0262	so the point be be that these be people who be in their early thirties think like that
S0261	mm
S0262	imagine like you don't need to imagine cos you be go through it but imagine other people who be get to the point now where they haven't do that shift in their early thirties of actually get into the thing that they want to be in they're actually now go shit if i don't fuck do this now by the age of sometime forty i'm probably go to be do this job for the rest of my fuck life
S0261	well i i think it's fair to say a lot of people leave their their position their current job work for somebody else and and they pick up pick up their own thing and they cramp their own business and they act as consultants that they but they're operate within their own discipline they they take
S0262	well that yeah
S0261	expertise and
S0262	like who give us an example of who
S0261	well just lot of people who just go out on their own be consultants
S0262	like who like lot of people who
S0261	erm they they do that people do that erm an example be at that erm you know er change my career thing there be people who be present themselves as career coach and a lot of those people have come from a variety of background and they have somehow they they have get out of work for somebody else and they create their own business work as a career coach use whatever skills they have and that could be simply along the idea that they're experience in life and therefore they have something better to offer to somebody else they're they're a relative expert there
S0262	yeah i mean like
S0261	and others would be experts in it you know they they they have hr experience to the end of the earth
S0262	alright alright alright alright
S0261	or whatever you know
S0262	alright these people be people
S0261	that's an example
S0262	exactly it's an example you've give of ones people i haven't meet i'm try to make it miles more tangible for you of people that you've actually get to know and that you understand some of their psyche you know why do a man choose okay you're not the only one
S0261	mm
S0262	give you two example we could think of more why do a man choose to change his career from what he have in his twenties thirties into something different at a different time in his life okay why do a man choose to do that answer me that
S0261	erm
S0262	and i'm talk about a man not a woman
S0261	right er well i i think part of the reason be that erm fortunately from my side of of the coin some of the imperatives aren't there on the context of erm if you have to if you have to graft and you have to earn money and you've get a family to er to to care for then the prerogative be bring in money day in day out that's just it you know so erm
S0262	but you bring in money day in day out for the majority of your life as work as a civil engineer in england you didn't have a family to think of you do it anyway
S0261	yeah yeah that no that's that's that's right erm
S0262	and now when we're think about have a family in actual fact the money be be not really what you're chase so i ask you the question why generic okay general question why do you think a man this be where i think i need to understand the male psyche why do a man choose something that's run along quite well yeah in his twenties and thirties choose to shift for whatever reason into a different career where i'm talk about psyche i'm not talk about oh cos i get make redundant i'm talk about where be that drive come from
S0261	i i think the drive simply be be to to be your own boss
S0261	to to do to do it for yourself
S0262	to be your own man
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and it's it's not about prove anything it's simply a case of that the driver be i it's freedom relate it's simply i want the choice to be able to make decisions that i want and that's what let's say democracy's about people would to be able to make the choice they want and this be another to it erm work for somebody else doesn't provide you the environment to do the things that you want to do you can't always do the things you want to do and so quite often you you park or you just dismiss or you hide away those ideas etcetera things that just be never erm feasible you know
S0262	so can i can i add my two pennies worth okay with men they clearly i think men be very very good at distinguish erm what other men be try to achieve yeah they're pretty clear i think in the in when you get to be a manager you start to wield some power yeah you either like it or you don't hopefully you do like it yeah otherwise you wouldn't do it but from the guy as as you call it you know the type of word you'd use when you be talk about engineer with senior engineer or or management in engineer company swing their dicks around suck my cock you know the way you would actually describe these people you be work with you know or in meet with it sound horrendous it sound really like too fuck much in many ways yeah and what i didn't like about it be it be so male dominate it be so much male talk it be so much like i'm an alpha male you're not you're be you're a whatever so you're gonna have to follow me because basically i've get the power shut up fuck off and you'll do what i say yeah and that male dominate world i'm sorry if you don't fit into it it's shit it's crap it's it's gotta be one of the worst place to be if you're if you wanna be your own man yeah like most men want to be their own men who want to actually just roll over and go yeah fuck off i just wanna be erm dominate by another man no you don't what what man really want to be dominate by another man i mean really i don't want to be fuck dominate by another woman so my idea of this psyche the driver be that actually sometimes it get to the point where i'm not management i'm fuck off i'm gonna be my own fuck boss because no fuck man be go to fuck talk to me like that
S0261	well erm well i mean it's a it's not as simple as that erm
S0262	okay well tell me if it's more complicate than that because clearly i'm not a man so i can't get into that psyche but all i'm show but all i'm show but all i'm show
