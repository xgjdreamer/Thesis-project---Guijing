S0424	well i dunno what would be
S0144	just seem a bite i dunno
S0424	he's get a bite a bite of a midlife crisis and i i i sympathise with him you know he but i then it's a cushy job
S0144	yeah
S0424	and i think he have a bite of phd disease of sometimes when you get people get phds they they think right i'm an expert in everything now and you therefore you should look up to me
S0144	yeah
S0424	can't work like that
S0144	mm mm
S0424	that's why i'm glad i do the postdoc cos you know no well er it do go to your head get a phd and then
S0144	yeah
S0424	you know you think you work with some other profession and you think god i know fuck all
S0424	it bring you back down to earth i think
S0144	well i suppose a phd i mean you're focus on a particular field right
S0424	yeah
S0144	a very particular
S0424	yeah it's very kind of
S0144	thing so
S0424	yeah
S0144	anyone else speak about their particular field be gonna be
S0424	yeah
S0144	completely outside the bound of yours
S0424	yeah
S0144	yeah i i might i might do one in future think about it quite miss
S0424	mm
S0144	brain work haven't do any of a while anyway mm i'm not sure what kind of area to go into though i'd like to get into propaganda but that really would be a phd kind of you know teach lecture thing
S0424	mm
S0144	you know as i i think i i don't know if i wanna i i'd i'd prefer to do something a bite more practical that i could actually apply mm something outside of academia i dunno i suppose
S0424	well that be my idea that's why i do film archive cos it be
S0144	yeah
S0424	practical
S0144	yeah
S0424	but the job have pay fuck all you know
S0144	yeah
S0424	i think i be gonna be discover miss reel of metropolis
S0424	like it's like the film indian jones
S0424	where it will be just be like wow i find it
S0424	but in fact i end up just catalogue crap for
S0144	yeah discover all these like film archive with i dunno like mgm like track you
S0144	all their spy try to try to get you mm mm i wonder with that kind of thing do you think it's a bite like microsoft where you know the they're light years ahead of their technology that they're release and they just kind of release it bite by bite just to to gain the maximum profit do you think
S0424	what do the film company
S0144	well do you think film company have like these old film do you think they've actually get load of different bits of the film and every five years they just
S0424	no
S0144	no
S0424	no not for old film ninety five percent of silent film have go forever
S0144	mm
S0424	they they burn them they literally burn them because in the old days with nitrate with the emulsion you use to get silver
S0144	oh
S0424	so they burn them down for the silver
S0144	oh jesus
S0424	yeah but you see nobody think it be gonna last
S0144	yeah
S0424	you know it's well nobody's gonna watch silent film any more i kind of
S0144	yeah
S0424	admire it in a way i admire that
S0144	yeah
S0424	i mean i'm i'm an archivist on on one level i believe in it but on the other hand like yeah just burn it you know and move on but
S0144	yeah it's progression
S0424	yeah
S0144	i suppose but yeah it's it's only retrospect you can see those kind of things
S0424	but erm there's a great book call the parade's go by write by a guy call kevin brownlow who er he's he's he win an oscar the i think he actually but he's work and he i've meet him a couple of time and he talk about marty you know like martin scorsese you know he martin scorsese er you know look up to him you know he's that kind of historian
S0144	mm
S0424	and erm he write this book the parade's go by because erm he get sick of see these silent film with shit print show at the wrong speed and all this sort of stuff and he go to interview all these the survive er silent film makers and they would talk about their film oh yeah they be awful and he be say no he you know in cultural memory people not only in cultural memory do people think these film be really amateurish but even the people who make them be be infect by this and they think their film be awful and he we he say i be on this one man crusade to prove that the filmmakers of the past be not idiots and he he's devote his entire life to er the story you know these sort of film
S0424	only a guy mm and they're but i be at do film archive and he go in every year i dunno if he still go to do
S0144	at
S0424	yeah
S0144	mm
S0424	to do er he do a talk to the film archivists but he won't talk to the academics
S0424	and he won't deal with academics he hat academics
S0424	which make me feel cool because i be an archivist at the time
S0424	i understand his point and erm so all the so he come down the archive room which be they're tiny and all the academics have to sort of file in and stand up at the at the at the back
S0424	cos they wanna see him
S0424	cos it's kevin brownlow you know
S0424	and erm
S0424	he be walk towards the archive room with this with this guy call charles barr who be this great cinema academic cinema historian and my mate saw him he be like walk along with him and charles barr say to and he say well i don't understand why you won't do a good proper academic talk for us and say i just i don't like all the jargon
S0424	and charles barr go but but you're a you're an extremely valuable empirical resource
S0424	without even any irony at all
S0424	prove his point
S0144	mm oh i'll just go for a piss
S0424	mm how do you say it in chinese
S0144	yeah how the hell do you say in chinese

S0424	yeah
S0144	at that age you know you just wanna be part of something and so everything else like education forget that you just kind of wanna be popular or
S0424	mm
S0144	er for me it be just it be shit and i i didn't like it
S0424	well when i be er i mean i i barely go for the last two years and you know my mum be quite strict
S0144	mm
S0424	you know we be i dunno it be just one cos the teachers be on strike a lot so we just use to use that as an excuse and go round my mate's house
S0424	oh the teachers be on strike again
S0424	and then either that or we'd go and hang around by the canal which be
S0424	i mean i must have put my mum through hell
S0424	cos we
S0144	yeah
S0424	tut anyway
S0424	dunno why i guess i be just an awkward kid i regret it you know
S0144	yeah but er it show though i mean look where you be now you know it er it show what the education system be up until the age of sixteen and it's not really that
S0424	mm
S0144	important
S0424	mm
S0144	really it it's more on yourself what you consider important and your own motivations
S0424	yeah
S0144	to do things that's
S0424	mm
S0144	and yeah you're gonna pick up a few things there but
S0424	but i do think i be thick
S0144	mm
S0424	i really think the reason i be in the i be the bottom class
S0144	mm
S0424	i er i honestly think i be thick
S0144	mm
S0424	and there be you know there be a couple of teachers who'd oh you're not my mum use to tell me i'm not but cos of course
S0144	yeah
S0424	your mum's gonna say er you know
S0144	yeah mm
S0424	but i just think all my interest be in other areas i be interest
S0144	yeah
S0424	in music and book
S0144	yeah
S0424	you know
S0144	yeah
S0424	weird
S0424	read a lot of book and you don't think you're clever
S0424	but er yeah
S0144	nah it's it's all about read book
S0424	yeah
S0144	i'd i'd say that's the most important thing
S0424	mm
S0144	and that's really what i'm gonna not push but i'm certainly gonna suggest to to to read as much as she can
S0424	yeah
S0144	cos that er that's what widen your fuck knowledge right
S0424	yeah
S0144	i mean we say you're go to uni what be you read you know
S0424	yeah
S0144	er er it's all about it's not about go to the lecture
S0424	mm
S0144	go to the seminars it's about get the book from the library and
S0424	yeah
S0144	fuck read it and understand it
S0424	this be what i don't like about academia
S0144	mm
S0424	i mean when i first start my phd i remember this i be i be sit wait for wait to see my supervisor in the sort of communal area outside his office and so i be read moby dick
S0424	and the head of the department come past you know hi what be you read i'm read moby dick why why be you
S0424	read that how be that relate to your research it's not
S0144	mm
S0424	i'm just read moby dick
S0424	and it's just like this sort of and er you know no compute like well if it's not relate to your research why be you read it
S0144	mm
S0424	and then two minutes later this other lecturer come past hi what be you read i'm read moby dick why be read moby dick
S0424	er why what do you mean why be i read moby
S0424	how can you why would you even say that
S0424	why be you read moby dick it's fuck moby dick that's why
S0424	i'm read moby dick
S0144	yeah yeah
S0424	but erm you do get a lot of i mean i it's a i i feel like a break record now cos i say er say it all the time but you just fuck get so many academics who don't know when the second world war be they don't know the who the goodies and baddies be
S0144	mm
S0424	how can you possibly be an educator in any capacity if you you haven't get the basic general knowledge you might know a load about gender representation in cambodian cinema but
S0144	well that's that's what it be though now right
S0424	you can't no yeah
S0144	it it's you know something about something
S0424	yeah
S0144	doesn't matter if you don't know anything else
S0424	yeah
S0144	it's almost like really er be it better to have everyone general basic knowledge you know
S0144	right maybe one more beer or maybe two i dunno alright
S0424	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0424	yeah
S0144	she just want to know what erm what i'm do for food cos we've get a bite of thai curry leave in the fridge so
S0144	i think she's just gonna finish that up
S0144	good
S0424	yeah i'll probably only have one or two more and then i've gotta go
S0144	yeah
S0424	cos
S0144	yeah could do that
S0424	yeah i think er you've just get to know outside your specialism
S0144	mm
S0424	you've gotta know something
S0144	mm mm mm
S0424	that's the thing but erm
S0144	otherwise it become kind of brave new world
S0424	yeah but yeah and the savage know about
S0424	he know about shakespeare what the hell be this
S0424	yeah it be that kind of thing
S0144	yeah yeah
S0424	but where the you you advance your career out of your by your research
S0144	mm
S0424	so people don't wanna know outside their areas basically
S0144	mm
S0424	they consider it
S0144	well we can only hold so much
S0424	er a waste of time
S0144	in our head
S0424	yeah
S0144	right and to get ahead of everyone else
S0424	mm
S0144	you have focus so much on
S0424	yeah
S0144	one thing now
S0424	so you've gotta be like you've if you're gonna be an educator if you're gonna teach as well you've get to have you know an answer to some of their question
S0144	yeah
S0424	i tell you about the the girl who be do a phd in american post war literature didn't i erm we be talk about history and i be say about how badly it's teach in school and erm she say in her history lessons she study elvis presley i think fuck great you know that's a i say
S0144	yeah
S0424	what do you learn about elvis presley she go er well about how his public image change from be you know this rebel to be be this er sort of all american hero after he come back from the war and er what war
S0424	she think it be the second world war i say when do you think the second world war be she say some time in the fifties
S0424	she be do a phd in post war american literature
S0144	oh my god
S0424	i say what make you think elvis fight in the second world war well didn't he i say no i mean he be in the army
S0144	yeah
S0424	for eighteen months in germany
S0144	yeah
S0424	and he make some film none of which be set in the war
S0424	i mean and she get an a
S0144	jesus
S0424	in her history
S0144	yeah
S0424	and and this i i'm just so
S0144	yeah that's
S0424	gobsmacked
S0144	yeah
S0424	to study post war when you've gotta at least know when the war be and that it be not in the
S0424	nineteen fifties
S0144	fuck hell
S0424	she be study thomas pynchon who write about the second world war so
S0144	yeah it's quite worry
S0424	it's that kind of just
S0144	yeah
S0424	i mean she be er well you know i get erm well it's not really my specialism the war you know
S0144	yeah but you know what
S0424	you er you could at least
S0144	er the date be and
S0424	you could at least allow yourself to know you know
S0144	you just have to learn two date
S0424	yeah
S0144	the start and end
S0144	it's not difficult
S0424	i mean 's a bite like that
S0144	mm
S0424	she's like you know
S0144	yeah that's
S0424	she's a bite like
S0144	that's more chinese though you know that's kind of
S0424	yeah i mean cos they've get a lot more i think they grow up with grow up with a lot more pressure
S0144	mm
S0424	cos there's i dunno a billion of them and all go for the same job
S0144	yeah
S0424	you know
S0144	and just the the lack of kind of knowledge of history as well
S0424	yeah no i mean i'm talk about step outside of her specialism
S0144	oh right oh okay
S0424	erm you know she's you know she's very concentrate
S0144	yeah
S0424	on what she do
S0144	well that er as well be very chinese as well
S0424	yeah
S0144	yeah because yeah like you say
S0424	yeah
S0144	yeah the competition
S0424	but i yeah but i didn't start my phd until i be in my thirties
S0144	mm
S0424	and i think i'm a better educator for it
S0144	mm
S0424	i think i'm a better writer for it cos at least
S0144	mm
S0424	i know what be go on at the time you know
S0144	yeah exactly yeah that's why er i think i'd be better do my phd now
S0424	mm
S0144	even like if i start in my forties you know don't think that's a problem i think that's probably better like for me
S0424	plato say you shouldn't study philosophy until you're over forty
S0144	there you go well philosophy be something i'd consider and i i think i'd be quite good at that
S0424	mm
S0144	but i don't like quote other people's word it's one thing as well it's kind of like do english literature where you just look at other people's work whereas at school i always want to just write my own stuff
S0424	mm
S0144	er i'd write these poems and short stories and and it would never come into the syllabus it be always about er critically evaluate other people's
S0424	yeah mm
S0144	you know it's the same with with philosophy really
S0424	yeah
S0144	i mean do you just study other people's ideas or do you try and move it forward and think of your own ideas
S0424	well a the purpose of a phd i suppose be to move
S0144	yeah
S0424	scholarship forward so that
S0144	yeah
S0424	by definition you would be a
S0144	yeah
S0424	philosopher if you be do
S0144	yeah
S0424	a phd in philosophy
S0144	i suppose you need to know the past to to
S0424	yeah
S0144	to do the future but that's one part of education i didn't like i mean er every time we like we do get the chance to like write a poem or a short story or something but mine mine would always be the one that'd be like read out
S0424	yeah me too i be always good at that
S0144	in front of my class or whatever
S0424	like it break my heart now
S0144	yeah
S0424	cos i'm write so much academic work
S0144	yeah
S0424	yeah i've gotta write a novel i really have
S0144	yeah
S0424	dunno if the chance have pass cos you've really gotta do that shit in your twenties haven't you
S0144	yeah
S0424	but william burroughs didn't publish naked lunch till he be forty five
S0144	no there's no it's there's no such thing er i think i think that's just your motivation thing
S0424	yeah
S0144	you're move motivate to publish when you're
S0144	when you're in your twenties than when you're in your
S0144	when you're in your forties oh okay yeah
S0424	mm
S0144	that's not gonna happen
S0144	too late
S0424	yeah but i would if i don't write a novel at least write a novel
S0144	well yeah
S0424	you know i've get i will regret it so
S0144	yeah
S0424	whether it get publish or not
S0144	yeah yeah i dunno if i could write a novel never get things finish i can't even get a short story finish let alone a novel 's nearly finish one do you know that
S0424	a novel
S0144	yeah
S0424	oh good for her
S0144	couple of months she reckon she's gonna she's be work on it for about seven years or something
S0424	yeah wow
S0144	yeah
S0424	yeah we we make friends again the other week
S0144	yeah
S0424	not that we ever break friends
S0144	yeah
S0424	officially
S0144	yeah
S0424	but erm you know
S0144	yeah it be a weird yeah be really but i don't know what it be
S0424	just it be the
S0144	yeah
S0424	i think i'm just assume i ask and she say it be the erm yeah and i like her
S0144	yeah that's good
S0424	i always like her
S0144	yeah
S0424	that's why that's why you know it upset me a little bite that
S0144	yeah
S0424	you know
S0424	i think i always manage to cos we get the same you now we you know we're from the we're both from we've both get you know overlap interest in music
S0144	mm
S0424	and literature
S0144	yeah yeah
S0424	you know she's clever
S0144	yeah
S0424	and she's you know
S0144	mm
S0424	so we could always talk about er music and book and other things and movies
S0144	yeah yeah i think it must have be anyway mm
S0424	mm yeah
S0144	but i don't i didn't really see her and i don't know why she like him to be honest
S0424	mm
S0144	maybe he show an interest in her and i think she might be a little bite susceptible like that i dunno
S0424	well he always play the victim i think with other people
S0144	yeah i think
S0424	you know and she felt sorry for him
S0144	i think that's like where he might have get her
S0424	i mean i felt sorry for him don't get me wrong you know he but there's only so far you can go
S0144	yeah
S0424	feel sorry when
S0144	yeah cos i mean 's have a fuck hard life
S0424	mm
S0144	yeah it's she's have a shit storm life but it's
S0424	yeah
S0144	so i think when someone else come and say oh you know i've have a hard time
S0424	yeah
S0144	you know she and take the bait you know yeah yeah i i think you two should be good mat

S0144	and very
S0424	yeah
S0144	just very
S0424	yeah

S0424	mm yeah
S0144	she's kind of she's on the periphery
S0424	yeah
S0144	you know just kind of i think she be just kind of sussing everyone out
S0424	yeah
S0144	never get involve you know and cos she's so softly speak and things you just kind of
S0424	yeah
S0144	you know i often find that i be kind of maybe talk over her or whatever because

S0424	the advance they just they keep come and come and

S0424	mm
S0144	you have to look after someone else and you have to be in that area as well
S0424	yeah
S0144	so it kind of limit where you can live
S0424	yeah
S0144	in to start with
S0424	mm
S0144	which therefore limit the kind of job you can get in
S0424	yeah
S0144	and then the the hours you work as well i mean it's it's just a fuck you know a lot of people must have this i mean
S0424	mm
S0144	but i cos my family's very dysfunctional you it be i'm the only one to take that position
S0424	mm
S0144	and i don't wanna do it but if i don't do it that would make me a complete cunt
S0144	i mean it's my mum you know
S0424	yeah
S0144	and i love my mum i mean the fuck up she be but she's still
S0424	yeah
S0144	mother

S0424	mm
S0144	and do whatever i wanna do but i can't let her rot away
S0424	yeah
S0144	you know i fuck can't

S0144	she raise me albeit in a you know
S0144	in a bad way but
S0424	a cack hand way yeah

S0424	mm
S0144	they build themselves up cos they make right decisions you know

S0144	mm
S0424	make but oh they make bad decisions they have proper welfare state and full employment and strong trade unions and things
