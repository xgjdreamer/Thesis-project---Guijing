S0679	so what do you want to do this afternoon when we get over to your house
S0680	well we can have a look in one of those another one of those top cupboards
S0679	mm
S0680	to see what erm ancient treasure there be
S0679	mm i favour that top cupboard on the right because i think there might be toy in there and could it be possible that the garden set be in there you know what i mean by the garden set
S0680	mm with the little piece of er brown er well rectangles of brown plastic with hole in but but er
S0679	it be quite like chocolate really wasn't it
S0680	yes well it be a bite undulate
S0679	mm
S0680	and which you use a little erm plastic thing that look like a fork or spade handle
S0679	mm
S0680	with a point on
S0679	yes
S0680	because all the flower have a little erm sort of dimple in them at the bottom so that you could push them in with this implement and make them stand up like tulips and
S0679	yes yes
S0680	daffodils and and all sort of plant
S0679	well i think the tulips and the daffodils actually have that little hole but i think some of them you just push in with your finger
S0680	mm cabbage you do because they be little heart things
S0679	oh yes i remember the cabbage
S0680	like tiny brussels sprout
S0679	yes we may have have something a bite tall that might have be brussels sprout we have something would a brussels sprout have a sort of a a small cabbagey head at the top
S0680	well a brussels sprout grow up a stem it would have leave at the bottom and it might have a bite of that on the top but i don't know that we i don't think we have the runner bean because i didn't remember the frame
S0679	mm mm mm i remember something that keep fall over
S0680	i don't know i can't remember that
S0679	but the vegetables all come in my time with the garden pond
S0680	they be later yes
S0679	whereas you have the erm you have the flower border and the flower
S0680	i think i have the crazy pave
S0679	yes
S0680	greenhouse do i have the greenhouse
S0679	i think so i i do
S0680	because the greenhouse have little tiny seed trays with i think they have little line of green things in them or you could put or you could put little line of green in there but there be some
S0679	oh yes yes a bite like false eyelashes
S0680	yes
S0679	obviously in green i wonder what happen to my false eyelashes
S0680	they'd be dead once
S0679	yes i be go to say it be before that time when i be in that false eyelash era
S0680	and you get little tiny individual flower pot you could push the plant in as well
S0679	mm yes and they stand they be erm brown you know the terracotta and they stand in little grey base with hole in didn't they
S0680	i think they might have do because they be a bite toppley over otherwise i do believe we i think i think there may have be the odd import farm animal like rabbit and i think the little farm animal rabbit use to go on there and also maybe even the the sheep dog on occasion
S0679	gosh the swan oh yes and the swan the swan go and i think the round pond be use prior to get the artistic pond
S0680	yes well it be an improvise turquoisey blue one of the tin lids that push in rather than a push out so that it have get colour inside yes i remember that yes i think that be an improvise pond
S0679	mm yes yes yes yes i imagine that i be give the pond after we get the pond in the garden
S0680	quite possibly
S0679	or somewhere link in that era
S0680	i didn't start off with a pond because i have the garden set to go with my bayko set which would be consider as a a very dangerous thing for small children to play with now because it have rods metal rods you put in hole and slide the bricks down so there's all those spikey things you can stick yourself on
S0679	no mm yes yes and the floor that sort of brown sort of not really plastic but something a bite earlier
S0680	it be green the erm base be a greeny
S0679	the oh the big green base but i mean
S0680	you put the pole in
S0679	you put the pole in and then you put the first floor in
S0680	yes you have the pole
S0679	then you put some brown stuff in to support your corner
S0680	oh yes you you have erm i don't know what it be make of it be it wasn't exactly plastic it be sort of a cross between plastic and a a kind of like erm oil cloth in it it be sort of
S0679	they probably hadn't invent plastic as we know it we be pre lego here
S0680	no it look a bite like it look like a bite something you might things with punch hole in the old days erm i think yes you put those in for the to support just to keep the you have to keep your pole in because if you be do something tall you have to keep slip they have all little punch hole in so you slide them over your pole so that your upper storey the pole be in the right place to retain the bricks as they slide in because otherwise if you get get taller they could possibly not be as tight at the top as they be at the bottom until you actually put the roof on so you need some sort of erm intervene strengthen oh and that's right and and it have the different the different roof and you could have erm er what do you call it you could have erm a thing over a bay window er what do you call them a not a dormer window erm i've forget the term
S0679	mm velux
S0680	no it be er like you have over a bay window that you've get the roof come down and then you've get the the angle piece that stick out over the bay i've forget what they be call now
S0679	mm mm oh me too me too
S0680	one of those anyway you put those fancy bits on the roof to build out a a bay window
S0679	mm ah oh yes yes you actually stand the roof be a whole thing wasn't it a roof
S0680	well the big roof be solid
S0679	so you have to buy you have to build house to fit your roof
S0680	yes but you could only build house that be on the right grid on a grid pattern you couldn't make a an odd half inch somewhere so it have to be in the proportion of that but you could make up your own there's a whole book of erm design of house and castle and things you could garage and all sort of things you could build but you could do freehand as well as long as you consider what components you'd get because i do have several roof and there be also flat bits that you could make that you could possibly use as a garage or flat or you could put two of them together to make a small er pitch roof i mean pitch you know with a yes and there be different bay and things but i don't know how old that be because it be use before me i think 's friend have bayko because he's the only person i've ever talk about bayko with because he's only well he's the same age as so he be what maybe two years younger than me but he's get older sisters or they may have have it i don't know
S0679	yes no mm mm mm mm mm oh mm mm oh yes mm yes because families if you if you be the eldest or youngest it would make a big difference wouldn't it
S0680	you know so think that it be really from another era because i use to play with it when i be quite small you use to play with it when you be quite small didn't you because i use to make house for the like of and small erm the small pipe cleaner dolls from the dolls' house and things i think i use to put those in you know
S0679	mm mm mm oh mm you see i have i have lego too
S0680	and you have lego yes
S0679	but lego wasn't as wasn't as adaptable when it first come out because you only have the big size bricks but there's hundreds of ways that they erm but the what be we call it the build set
S0680	mm you get lego people now don't you mountains and all sort bayko
S0679	bayko would be dangerous
S0680	well there be all the small piece because you could get they be they be quite thin or maybe half inch half inch square but only about quarter of an inch thin they be the ones that slot in in red and white and then you could get ones that be just half the size of that or even thinner just for do different bits strip in brickwork or bits to fill in bay and they be very tiny
S0679	mm mm yes yes yes i didn't like the the pole those metal pole
S0680	and you get different size pole because you be go to need shorter pole for some things
S0679	yes there be quite a lot to it wasn't there
S0680	mm that's right because dad make that nice erm box
S0679	i wonder where he get it from
S0680	i don't know
S0679	perhaps somebody at school have it
S0680	it's possible it could have come from the because they be quite well off because it wasn't a cheap toy
S0679	be he older than you
S0680	yes
S0679	oh that would possibly be it then
S0680	and he be a boy i don't know so it may have come that way i don't think it be 's because it be quite an expensive toy
S0679	yes mm no it might have come from the
S0680	or somewhere somebody in that neck of the woods erm
S0679	yes yes and wouldn't necessarily pass it on because he'd have
S0680	mm that's right
S0679	but the be a possibility isn't it because he be more into more into motor wasn't he that boy
S0680	and he be an only boy and he hadn't get a brother
S0679	yes when the boy get feed up with it he would pass it on
S0680	mm because it all come in it come in various bits of cardboard box and things and father father make that
S0679	and do father yes
S0680	well he get all the things out and saw how many there be and then construct the box so it would fit in because you have to put it back in the right compartments
S0679	mm mm keep his screw or have keep his screw in a box of a sort of a similar but have the handle but i think he now keep them in something because it's alright if you be work all the time on them but there be all sort of problems like if you you know it doesn't have a top and things
S0680	yes mm there be two upstairs with top of 's
S0679	oh 's try lot of different kinds
S0680	it say transistors up the side but it be er i think he be put stuff gradually things into them
S0679	yes well if you have any that will get throw away it's worth offer them and it's worth think around if you could use them for other things like cotton or needle or something
S0680	mm yes well this be it i mean i've get i've get load of erm nut and bolt and screw and nail and things that i need to sort of my own because some of my stuff be here and some of my stuff be at 's and the same with my tool they be in two different place oh i must bring those tool up from the cellar to 's you know hammer and pliers
S0679	mm yes yes yes yes lot to do
S0680	yes i don't want to throw any tool away well not throw them away i don't want to give them away necessarily
S0679	no no you need to sort them out
S0680	because 's engineer's tool kit thing he take around with him have get really useful little type of erm long nose pliers and pliers with bend nose which be really useful because you can put them in and pick something out that's not immediately in front of you and so on if you're because they be for go in you know if you want to move little wire in a jumble of wire inside a a computer box you could actually get hold of things so i would like to keep those because i don't know anybody who i could pass them onto really
S0679	mm mm yes mm no it's all about find good home for things
S0680	i be always use his tool kit so i don't think he would mind
S0679	anyway i guess we probably ought to be get ready for go out now what do you think
S0680	i think so yes if we don't get blow away get into the car
S0679	gosh it be really rough out there today isn't it
S0680	mm i'm not go to go along the road with the big tree
S0679	no
S0680	that occasionally fall down and bits come off
S0679	enough trouble with your own tree but we can go round the back can't we
S0680	yes
S0679	well okay let me just er tidy this off then
