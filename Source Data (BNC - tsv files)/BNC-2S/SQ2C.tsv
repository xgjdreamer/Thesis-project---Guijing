S0115	special spot
S0037	yeah
S0115	it it get sort of jam in place and rid alongside it a bite like it's use use
S0037	yeah it be really weird like i'd never see anything
S0115	yeah i remember like like like jupiter's trojans live like they move at sixty degree angle in and out you get trap between the um the pull of the sun and the pull of jupiter
S0037	oh that's weird
S0115	so the trojan so the be share by the two pull i mean they get pull into the same orbit
S0037	yeah
S0115	um but they don't actually orbit jupiter they just they just stay in the same place
S0037	it's so weird like i wonder what possess them to do that like with uh an atom
S0115	um so it's the theory of uh uh it's it's it's uh boer's original theory be that that electrons orbit the atom like planets
S0037	so be they try to do it so that they could like um prove his einstein's laws on work on really small scale be that the point
S0115	no it's nothing to do with einstein it's uh it's to prove that boer's that boer's laws might be correct and it have apparently applications in uh like new type of quantum computers and um
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh some kind of lasers i think
S0037	in lasers
S0115	like some kind of high speed lasers or something but
S0037	i didn't read the whole article i just sort of skim it
S0115	they they don't they get the they get they jam it in place though use like it's supercooled or something it's not
S0037	oh yeah i
S0115	they have to they have to fix it wouldn't have work under condition
S0037	i think they do some of that in lancaster some of that supercooling stuff
S0115	yeah well they then they blast it with like pulse and stuff and uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	they have to to force the electron piece to go in place but it you there's other article relate that explain that type that special type of atom the rydberg atom or whatever it be other article explain that uh what it be um you you can see a diagram of the uh
S0037	not enough water
S0115	you can see a diagram of the uh um electron cloud go round it
S0037	seem there's be load of like
S0115	look like a cross between uh an electron
S0037	so be that you know that stargaze thing that brian cox thing
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	have that finish now then
S0115	i don't know uh i watch it last week and it be uh two or three episodes and i think it be just a one off yeah it be just three episodes of uh and it have uh dara o'briain in it and they go out and
S0037	d'you think this sorry
S0115	it be pretty good but
S0037	d'you think this aubergine's alright it look a bite brown
S0115	i don't know what it mean if it's brown uh i
S0037	i'm not sure
S0115	depend what you're do it be you gonna be you gonna boil it or
S0037	i be just gonna chuck it in there for the meal
S0115	uh just just throw it in the pan and
S0037	d'you think think it'll be alright or
S0115	yeah i mean i have some of it earlier it taste the same as before
S0037	oh right
S0115	well it do to me i mean
S0037	i'll just chuck it in
S0115	it's not i don't really like it uncooked very much but
S0037	i don't know if you're suppose to have it uncooked be you
S0115	i dunno but
S0037	be you just eat things from out of the fridge
S0115	yeah well it's one of the things that's not like like a mushroom not many people eat raw mushroom do they
S0037	no i suppose not
S0115	uh perhaps because like they release all the all the juice
S0037	when they're cook
S0115	you know when when they're cook so you're probably not get the most out of it if you have it raw
S0037	yeah
S0115	but i don't think it's one of those things that's poisonous or you're not suppose to have like a potato you're not really suppose to have that raw be you
S0037	be you not
S0115	i think it
S0037	be you not suppose to have them raw
S0115	potato
S0037	you know crazy you know crazy jim
S0115	no
S0037	you do jim jan and jim
S0115	yeah
S0037	he eat like potatoes like apples like
S0115	wow that's really strange
S0037	and onions which be less strange but still a bite strange
S0115	well onions a lot of people eat raw onions although it's a bite of a
S0037	but not like an apple not like
S0115	it's a bite it's a bite much to eat a whole onion raw isn't it cos it sort of sting you a bite
S0037	but not like a banana
S0115	get get that get that dry feel like a yeah like with a banana or or black tea where it get the get your mouth and you sort of
S0037	banana skin yeah
S0115	your tongue sort of stick to the um roof of your mouth a bite um
S0037	yeah
S0115	and that uh so no i i i think i read somewhere that a potato be um not not optimal when it's raw but
S0037	i always as well like you know like green bite when potatoes be green like what do that mean do that mean that you shouldn't eat them
S0115	just they're just uh overly raw aren't they
S0037	be that right though d'you ever get like a crisp that sometimes green
S0115	ah well that's something like uh
S0037	be that something different
S0115	uh no i i think that's just one that's escape through their through the system but um sometimes they have like brown pigmentation in crisp which be um it's bitter or something and they're try to gm genetically modify well potatoes to get rid of the brown bite of uh pigmentation or something i don't know
S0037	really god like of all the use for genetically modify
S0115	they'll do it they'll do a lot of things i mean but if it's a company then they'll provide fund um to i think they're probably i haven't have a bitter crisp so they probably already have do that i think
S0115	but but when you say genetically modify i mean cos partly it's just breed isn't i mean
S0037	do they not have to say on the packet
S0115	if you've get a bitter batch of if you get potatoes um and that particular family of potatoes that you're grow uh do have a lot of this bitter pigmentation or something then you could uh obviously just not um you know not not reuse that uh configuration you know
S0037	yeah yeah yeah i suppose yeah like genetically modify a potato's a bite different to like genetically modify a baby slightly
S0115	well uh yeah for i think it need need uh turn up maybe but
S0037	what do you uh want with this like rice or i have yeah um rice or or like noodles or what
S0115	uh probably noodles i think
S0037	where's the other ah where's the other pan
S0115	the uh well i can empty that cos that's uh this this one here's um there's not much there's only one round in that well not even a round just one single
S0037	yeah yeah i know i look at it this morning and i think like oh i should've thin that soup out earlier in the week
S0115	it's not a problem but uh just put it on here
S0037	yeah
S0115	and uh well that's probably a bite much for one but
S0037	no well
S0115	well a bite less for two though so
S0037	no it's not that's normally where it go up to like up to that line that's normally how much
S0115	think that's quite feel like quite a big one but yeah
S0037	do you like that soup i think it be a bite weird i know i make it but
S0115	uh this one i mean yeah well i don't
S0037	dunno
S0115	sort of it's sort chicken and uh but you put quite a bite of some herb in there be it i think it be uh
S0037	coriander it be cos it be
S0115	yeah that's that's fine i i like it i don't have a problem with with that soup at all um
S0037	maybe we'll use that butternut squash then for the soup next week
S0115	we didn't put an extra stock in there cos normally we put in um
S0037	oh no we'll have to use them ones out of the freezer they've take so much room
S0115	an extra the last ones we have be ham it be ham ones
S0037	yeah oh yeah they that be so salty
S0115	oh yeah well two sort of uh
S0037	but um i've order that haggis then for for friday
S0115	um oh you've oh you've put an order in for from sainsbury's
S0037	yeah
S0115	be the sainsbury's about to deliverer a haggis or what d'you want in this one then
S0037	uh can you put some water in him for the noodles
S0115	be this thing turn up
S0037	yeah i dunno it's just i think it's cos we've get since we've get that new pan it's like cos it's a bigger pan it take age
S0115	i would say it certainly take longer to
S0037	i say happy birthday to uh claire on facebook today d'you wanna
S0115	oh right
S0037	you'll have to maybe
S0115	um yeah yeah uh
S0037	i know you don't check it very often
S0115	right um yeah yeah
S0037	no no i mean don't have to it be 's birthday actually last yesterday or the day before
S0115	oh be it um
S0037	it's
S0115	i don't know there's there's a few people round i know aren't there
S0037	there's and 's be on
S0115	yeah
S0037	monday i think something like that it's useful that bin at me nana buy isn't it
S0115	there's the what the pan what
S0037	no like the little box
S0115	i like the box yeah that's good
S0037	i have to transfer them out of there
S0115	yeah you get a lot of uh recipes in it and
S0037	one of the problems be like i i get them sometimes i just get them off the internet and then make then and then forget where i've get them from so
S0115	right i didn't use to really use recipes i just use to throw everything in in uh
S0037	i think they're good for like if you run out of ideas so like i just tend to cook the same things like all all over and over again
S0115	yeah uh i think you learn you learn from them don't you
S0037	i think i've cut too many carrots um yeah
S0115	uh
S0037	oh yeah anyway i be gonna say about that brian cox thing
S0115	oh yeah yeah
S0037	like the funniest thing about that i think be like when they be like here we be live in devon and we're gonna turn all the light off and then it be like the cloudiest night of the year
S0115	um
S0037	it wouldn't have matter if all the light have be on
S0115	oh yeah uh i would've it would've be very good if that have work cos you'd have but it seem like it seem a bite pointless actually
S0037	it's quite clear here though the sky and i i think they're quite good although d'you remember in
S0115	they're alright not as good as but
S0037	d'you remember in
S0115	um which time
S0037	when we be when we go on that walk and through the forest and that but the bite before that when like you could see like all the milky way and stuff
S0115	yeah um
S0037	ooh ooh turn that off
S0115	it be good to be able to see that uh i'm not really very good at recognize what the uh constellations be but
S0037	na i know like three like the plough the dispute north star
S0115	the
S0037	uh
S0115	yeah north one be just to follow from uh the plough and then
S0037	orion's belt and that's about it
S0115	i can't uh yeah there's probably i mean uh some familiar shape but uh
S0037	those ones what's that one that's like a square that's a famous one as well
S0115	be that the pegasus that's a big square
S0037	yeah i think so yeah because they say that be what they be do on that programme like count how many star you could see inside like the square of pegasus
S0115	oh yeah to measure how
S0037	there's like a light pollution measurement thing
S0115	yeah wasn't there that that programme be good cos uh they sort of do a lot of uh astronomical cosmological stuff like they talk about black hole on one of them and uh that be kind of interest
S0037	yeah i think cos it be quite good as well it wasn't cos sometimes i think some of the science stuff like be a bite too what you do
S0115	yeah i just turn it up
S0037	oh right um i think some of the science things be a bite too um like babyish or like basic
S0115	yeah and that that didn't
S0037	like this be the human body like robert winston like point to an arm go this be an arm like
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	it's just a bite oh yawn yawn sort of thing but that this one be quite good i think it be quite good
S0115	yeah well it be go it be go into quite a lot of detail but they have they have uh brian cox uh this series do all the all his theories and or theoretical cosmology and stuff but then there be uh dara o'briain be there to sort of balance that with the comedy end a bite so
S0037	i bet like but i think like i bet real like real physicists if you like get really annoy by him d'you not think
S0115	real you think be not uh
S0037	you know like real invert commas physicists
S0115	probably some of them be i mean like they might um
S0037	you know when he's just like look at the star like
S0115	they might think he's not as good as they be cos he spend it he's more sort of for publicize in try to advertise try to get people to become uh
S0037	scientists
S0115	to become um cosmologists it's at the back
S0037	hey where's the honey have you see it where in the back at the top or
S0115	no at the back
S0037	oh
S0115	behind that cabbage
S0037	sorry yeah but
S0115	but so i don't really know uh but i mean we've get that book a brief history of time haven't we and and that's a bite sort of uh
S0037	oh that's so hard though
S0115	some of the stuff you don't know how true it be and um i remember talk about black hole actually on the show
S0037	that's the thing with anything anything that's theoretical though it's just like how it's just an idea isn't it really
S0115	well i don't know uh it's hard to sort of see how much be um definitely true and how much be um conjecture and how much uh be how to what extent be it true sort of
S0037	mhm
S0115	i mean to what extent be it back up by uh find who believe in it and who doesn't well problem with problem with the cosmology be that they have to fit everything in with their with their theories with the model the standard model
S0037	yeah
S0115	and everything they've gotta fit all the um all their observations have to fit into the the sort of complex network of uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh theories and um rule that they've get so they may be a bite restrict in some ways um in what they how they can explain things you know
S0037	i think it's quite
S0115	it's but it doesn't cos physics doesn't fully work together cos uh cos the sort of the small uh quantum physics doesn't fully um go together with the the larger einstein uh relativity
S0037	big physics yeah
S0115	so that uh um they they have to kind of just uh come up with ways to try and unify them
S0037	yeah
S0115	um but at the moment they they don't know so that's a big that uh there be a lot of mysteries there then a lot to be find out um so that's why they need people like cox to get people to join up sign up and uh um start theorize and
S0037	well i suppose he's promote it yeah get them into oh i'm not sure like
S0115	it's like the big the big bang the big big bang theory it's a bite like uh um that's sort of really really theoretical actually a lot of the stuff they talk about isn't it
S0037	well it's quite good though i suppose for make it for popularize it
S0115	like yeah and um the
S0115	the all the character be funny i mean that's it's just funny and people don't watch that really for
S0115	oh d'you mean uh the big bang or the
S0037	hm
S0115	do d'you mean big bang theory or d'you mean uh
S0037	what d'you mean
S0115	cox's programme big
S0037	oh well i be talk about big big bang but yeah both of them really
S0115	big bang but i dunno if that popularize physics but it
S0037	oh no science i suppose
S0115	sort of yeah i suppose
S0037	and be a geek like
S0115	yeah geekiness it popularize sort of sort of glamorize be geeky doesn't it uh sheldon
S0037	but that really come in though didn't it like like that whole um like recently all the cool kid or whatever so i'm tell uh be wear like you know like those glass really come in didn't they
S0115	who's these cool kid what glass
S0037	like last year you know those like they're like national health glass jarvis cocker kind of graham coxon
S0115	bite sort of square glass
S0037	you know they're really black like black rim thick ones like geek
S0115	well my dad's get some funny glass but they're more sort of
S0037	no not not not not exactly like that
S0115	big ones like the deirdre barlow glass
S0037	those be like miami vice glass
S0115	um or ben elton from the eighties ben elton with his with his jacket roll up and uh
S0037	deirdre barlows
S0115	you know there's his roll up roll up jacket
S0037	oh yeah blazer yeah
S0115	um uh and uh big deirdre barlow glass and
S0037	deirdre barlow deirdre barlow's still in it i think
S0115	yeah do she still have the same
S0037	ken barlow be ken barlow's be in right from the start you know he's just get like one thing on his cv like coronation street but um
S0115	he doesn't need to have a cv or it's just ken
S0037	just a picture of his face
S0115	it's just ken barlow with a signature across his photograph
S0037	sign photo
S0115	you know he doesn't he doesn't really i mean people would he doesn't have to he wouldn't have to get another job unless they unless they discontinue um
S0037	coronation street
S0115	that probably wouldn't happen within his sort of work uh work life i would have think
S0037	do i've tell you haven't i that me
S0115	cos until all the viewers sort of gradually begin to die out i don't think there'll be any sign of uh the end of coronation street but
S0037	i've tell you haven't i like that that the uh that me nana use to have a picture of like all of her grandchildren and the cast of coronation street
S0115	sign
S0037	like not not one picture like a picture of me a picture of our tom a picture of all my cousins and just nestle in with those a picture of the cast of coronation street like if they be similar of similar importance
S0115	that's uh phyllis isn't it
S0037	she's bonkers yeah bonkers
S0115	so she prefer but she also watch eastenders didn't she
S0037	she prefer corrie and emmerdale but not like she didn't like it that they be make it all like sexy and that
S0115	neighbour well older people don't normally like that sort of thing do they
S0037	no
S0115	i mean not on the tv
S0037	i mean she do like big brother and that
S0115	yeah i mean that could be filthy couldn't it i mean in term of the language and well just everything about it really be uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	i mean it's so sort of like it's sort of break a lot of conventions in in decency you know decency's just go hasn't it sort of on on on that i mean but uh
S0037	yeah i haven't watch it like for age really
S0115	that be uh shock thing
S0037	but anyway i be say so them glass you know the you know which ones i mean the really black ones
S0115	uh national health glass you say so
S0037	yeah so like they get really popular again and also like like as a bite of a cross uh
S0115	be that just for amongst um
S0037	i dunno like cool people
S0115	be it be it that be it be his name from uh uh the the it crowd um his name's something ayounde
S0037	oh yeah he be the footlights thing here wasn't he
S0115	be his name um richard or chris or something
S0037	yeah yeah richard the other one's call chris o'dowd
S0115	so i think he wear a pair of thick rim uh glass black glass
S0037	he do yeah
S0115	so um he might've help that's it
S0037	and also
S0115	so it's become more popular to be geeky but it's also become more popular to be a criminal i think as well so there's this well there's always a
S0037	well
S0115	you know the it's not it's not sort of
S0037	and but also those like jumpers you know like the kurt cobain jumpers
S0115	yeah i think it's probably more popular to look sort of grungy or whatever uh
S0037	load of them in primark
S0115	which which um be
S0037	i remember like sit on facebook like our amy have write something like no you're not cool you're just a slag in a rubbish jumper like you know all those like kind of you know girls who wanna be like you know in the town
S0115	that's the the sort of um you mean the the sort of holey gungy green jumpers
S0037	yeah like look really distress and like hey man this be from a charity shop no it's not it's from primark you know what i mean
S0115	fair enough
S0037	there's that amuse me oh it's quite funny
S0115	although i prefer jumpers to sort of some of the other things that you know local people wear uh
S0037	what d'you mean
S0115	more sort of
S0037	tracksuits and that
S0115	well them sort of bling like with clown on it and stuff
S0037	ah i love them they're hilarious like the ones like from a bite of elizabeth duke d'you know elizabeth duke
S0115	no
S0037	maybe maybe like maybe that that that's just i'm show my chav self there
S0115	i i think i think you might've mention it before but uh
S0037	elizabeth duke uh the jewellery range by argos
S0115	yeah i think you've mention that
S0037	and like they have you know like nine carrot gold teddy bear with jewel and like rubies for eye and like sapphires for you know
S0115	better better to stick with the jumper i think
S0037	ay
S0115	better to stick with the jumper
S0115	um
S0037	i never make enough sauce
S0115	they they have much uh bling then
S0037	oh load sovereigns you know um oh where be i oh i be in i be in new york matt and i saw like um they have load of stuff there on one of the streets near where the office be um they sell like loadsa like fake stuff oh can i have a bite of that sell loadsa like fake stuff and um one of the things that they sell then in this window be like load of like um that sort of horrible bling like massive chain with like things on the end all make out jewel and one of the things they have be jesus's face like make out of jewel
S0115	well now you remind me of the the that mexican um
S0037	thank you
S0115	that programme about mexico that i watch uh
S0037	which one
S0115	um well it's sort of uh
S0037	ah the one about the dead
S0115	some aspect of mexican culture where they they have a festival of the dead or something like that or they have like shrine to the dead but they sort of have a lot of um yeah a lot of model a lot of uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	be they call grave image or something um uh
S0037	i don't know
S0115	various uh various uh little um
S0037	ah i know what you mean that's i can't remember the word
S0115	little uh idol not not exactly idol that's a sort of a biblical word but yeah but image basically of uh of people and um
S0037	oh it's on the tip of me tongue
S0115	so there's a bite of a similarity with that i think
S0037	yeah like jesus's face make out of jewel though like how stupid
S0115	they uh but can you get can you get a stick of rock with uh with jesus on it i think
S0037	i can get you one for christmas if you want one you know from the vatican maybe aye
S0115	mm
S0037	they have all that kind of stuff there
S0115	have you ever find the one of those uh you know the face of the virgin mary in a in a in a carrot or something like
S0037	not not as yet
S0115	maybe you weren't look hard enough or
S0037	i know i'll have to keep me eye peel
S0037	what's that thing call though that's that's the name for it when you see face in things
S0115	oh yeah um i've forget what that's call
S0037	where do i read that
S0115	i tell you about it it be in the new scientist
S0037	oh right
S0115	uh that be in on a uh thing about um sort of explain the unexplained with science
S0037	excuse me oh that's right no i read it no i read it it's in it's in the bathroom
S0115	which be call uh para something
S0037	about yeah cos they be say about those like glow orb be just actually like um mist steam and that kind of thing on the lens
S0115	yeah that's um yeah that's there be a term for that when when you think
S0037	i don't believe in any of that sort of supernatural stuff
S0115	so there be yeah they be talk about uh photos and and where you see yeah uh they have say maybe ten different uh effect that people mistake for
S0037	yeah
S0115	ghost or some other kind of um
S0037	i remember
S0115	supernatural uh be and uh there be different trick and they include things like uh uh uh like if you get a glass window in front and and it would create a kind of a phantom sort of figure on the in the glass and then
S0037	mm reflective the photographer in it
S0115	the other one be if you get water on the lens it can create little little spot which can shine and look like uh a
S0037	they're suppose to be orb of energy
S0115	orb of energy or ufos or something
S0037	oh me mam believe in all that kind of bollocks like
S0115	also saw a programme around the same time about uh that that be the cox and uh that be the cox programme actually
S0037	oh when he be
S0115	the where they do the little little thing about ufos
S0037	oh cos they that's right that's right
S0115	and um sort of uh they obviously professor brian cox be a bite sceptical about ufos
S0037	oh right of course
S0115	uh the the existence i mean
S0037	d'you want any green bean
S0115	i think if you're intelligent enough to get to earth
S0037	yeah
S0115	then you'd be intelligent enough not to reveal yourself in a clumsy sort of wabbling uh nineteen fifties look black and white saucer
S0037	should buy more should order some more green bean will you write will you write it on the list
S0115	uh what
S0037	i've have like an annoy sort of thing all day like you know when you're talk and you can feel like your throat clog up
S0115	um
S0037	and then you've gotta go like that
S0115	oh you mean phlegm
S0037	lovely yes i mean phlegm but you know what i mean i be on the phone earlier and i be like every like few minutes i be like i'm really sorry about this
S0115	no i didn't know that uh yeah well if you if you mean something's go down the wrong way
S0037	maybe it be after that like choke fit that i have other day
S0115	a choke fit uh
S0037	i be like stand over the uh corridor i'd eat something out the pan and i be like like for age and age
S0115	yeah um that's um
S0037	i be like the heimlich doctor heimlich
S0115	and and you you that be when you be make that soup uh
S0037	i know
S0115	the the chicken soup you'd you'd make the soup
S0037	choke on soup
S0115	and then test it and then nearly kill yourself with the soup um
S0037	doctor heimlich have you see that eddie izzard sketch
S0115	uh i think so i think i've see almost all of eddie izzard
S0037	and he's like try to invent something and he's like ah i will invent a manoeuvre
S0037	d'you remember
S0115	well he's just he's just sit in his studio artist's studio
S0037	no he's a doctor doctor heimlich
S0115	yeah and uh oh he he be think
S0037	he be try to invent something um like he and he's have a lot of money but
S0115	to get to get oh yeah to get uh fame
S0037	yeah exactly
S0115	just uh
S0115	do you say that it's quite brutal the heimlich and that you can end up with a break rib
S0037	oh yeah but i think it doesn't matter you'd happily break all your rib rather than choke wouldn't you well most people would
S0115	suppose so yeah i guess but if you be the if you be the person do the manoeuvre you you might be afraid that you didn't want to like break a rib you know cos it might have a do something
S0037	you don't you don't do it with children
S0115	yeah
S0037	with children you you just like dangle them upside down
S0037	actually if they're little enough you're suppose to
S0115	so maybe that would work if it be a small person as well
S0037	you're suppose to hold them by the legs with one hand and then like wallop them on the back with the other hand
S0115	right okay i'll bear that in mind so if you've get a choke child grab the child and and shake it upside down
S0037	like if they're a baby mm whack them hardly a firmly in between the shoulder blades
S0115	it's the same procedure as if you'd trap something inside an inanimate which you could pick up
S0037	this be very very true or if you're try to get some sauce out of a tomato ketchup bottle
S0115	so um yeah or although that's normally you would you would hit it on the base but
S0037	no that doesn't work i've i've have you try that
S0115	be there not
S0037	well it do work eventually but hit it on hit it on a side to side motion as oppose to an up and down motion be much more effective
S0115	yeah you just whack it yeah normally i would shake it actually or get a knife and the knife will uh do some kind of scientific process that i don't know the name of and pull draw it down
S0037	oh yeah suction
S0115	uh i don't know
S0037	some sort of suction surely
S0115	it's not it's some it's to do with the the the ketchup follow the the knife or something
S0037	oh right
S0115	or or not i'm not sure could be
S0037	ooh i've get a bite of a headache ah still a bite crispy be you suppose to throw it on the wall hooray must be do that's what they say isn't it
S0115	it's really sticky
S0037	yeah i've just really cook it i've overcook it so it's like glue pasta still taste a bite hard to me
S0115	so d'you wanna mix the
S0037	yeah
S0115	noodles in with the vegetables
S0037	yeah wish we have a proper drain thing
S0115	need that you can use a for what what be you what sort of drainer would've

S0037	bite of lemon juice bite of chilli
S0115	should put put a bite of uh bite of water in with that or
S0037	if you want to there's some juice in the fist
S0115	right
S0037	so could put that in
S0037	i'm aware of make it too runny though cos that's the
S0115	no i don't think that would happen with the uh
S0037	noodles
S0115	with this one cos think there's a lot of noodles so like they'd absorb it
S0037	yeah
S0115	un and it's a
S0037	it be a bite of a habit of mine though there's always like a watery sort of
S0115	well no i think that's your style isn't it you like to make a watery watery sauce
S0037	no it's not suppose to my it's not suppose be my style it's just an unfortunate
S0115	sort of a broth like a like a a minestrone like a a cross between a minestrone and uh like spaghetti bolognese
S0037	ah it's not suppose to be though see what this taste like
