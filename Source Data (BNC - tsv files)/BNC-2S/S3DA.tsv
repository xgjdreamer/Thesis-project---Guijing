S0254	what like an actual dryer
S0253	yeah yeah like a maiden like an actual dryer
S0254	you can get heat maidens
S0253	i think that would make it worse i think all that would do it make load and load of steam
S0254	yeah
S0253	like
S0254	yeah it would your house would be really damp
S0253	yeah
S0254	it just i do i do like stuff that's be dry
S0253	i i've if i could have any luxury in my house i'd have a dry cleaner i i just
S0254	you mean just like a dryer tumble dryer
S0253	i'll say dryer i mean dry cleaners
S0254	somebody to come in to dry clean
S0253	and have a dry cleaners just in my wardrobe no yeah sorry they get a
S0254	a tumble dryer
S0253	cos their parent have them and you don't have to iron anything
S0254	i know they be nice
S0253	everything come out like warm and fresh
S0254	they just use to much electricity
S0253	mm
S0254	if we have one of those little odometer things like how much electricity you're use
S0253	they be say the other day i don't know what's up with them i don't know whether you say that the parameters of it and say you know this how much energy i
S0254	no no just tell you how much it use
S0253	it keep give my parent warn and tell them they're like kill penguins
S0254	i don't know about that
S0253	i say we go one one morning we be in the house and i hadn't like i'm just go to shut that i hadn't like watch tv have a shower or anything and my mum and dad don't really use much energy by the time i get downstairs at ten in the morning my dad have have the grill on and it just cook so it's go make this noise and it be like yeah like you've use x amount of energy today
S0254	maybe they have it set really low don't put anything on
S0253	eco mode
S0254	like you have one light on the light on in one room for five minutes it's like electricity use
S0253	but their whole thing be like and i guess it be good cos it's people it's like probably didn't realise how much energy they be use cos you do forget
S0254	yeah yeah yeah
S0253	and it's also interest about like different things how
S0254	doctor mick
S0253	and i think it's dermick
S0254	dermick
S0253	dermick his name
S0254	dermot buy swiss
S0253	yeah yes definitely
S0254	exactly like that
S0253	no erm but i think the idea be you know it keep people sort of aware of what they're use it's like any sort of like alarm that you buy there's things you just do everyday and you don't think how much money you're spend here
S0254	yeah cos you just like fritter away
S0253	keep keep
S0254	get lunch on a card or petrol on the card
S0253	or people who keep like food diaries and you know it's only like those people
S0254	yeah
S0253	from channel four have get a pile of food on the table
S0254	in a tube
S0253	and you realise what you use and what you eat in a day
S0254	yeah
S0253	and i suppose it's a good thing for that but
S0254	cos i go through i have an app on my phone for a while and i put in exactly what i and i tot up how many calories
S0253	should be dead
S0254	cos i felt like what
S0253	laugh
S0254	what be you laugh
S0253	it's just laugh it how long do it take to fit it all in
S0254	how rude i don't eat load
S0253	you constantly snack
S0254	no i don't actually i do don't
S0253	you do
S0254	i don't i could tell you i've eat look breakfast have breakfast at home i have lunch at lunchtime i have two chocolate finger in the afternoon and then i have nothing for tea and then i've just have pudding that's a perfectly rationable rational amount of food
S0253	that be a very rational amount of food
S0254	but erm yeah like i be try to just to see you know that secret eater programme particularly in my last job cos we have a box
S0253	yeah biscuits
S0254	we have a box full of food and in just in the office when like whenever it be start to get low someone would bring in a box of maltesers and biscuits and it be just constantly
S0253	oh my word
S0254	always in the office and any time you go to go to the loo or to do the door or to the file cabinet you have to pass this magical box of food so of course you just
S0253	and if you didn't have to you find a way to pass it
S0254	exactly and then when you're sit there bore like if your bore in work the only thing you can do that's enjoyable be either make a couple of tea go to the toilet or eat something
S0253	erm i enjoy go to i enjoy go to the bathroom cos i know i'll be leave alone
S0254	yeah i know i find myself just sit in there for a little while
S0253	that's what i do as well
S0254	it's quiet nobody can bother me
S0253	sound weird i just like i just lie to chill cos i just know that if i'm in the hall i'll get stop by someone
S0254	yeah but i suppose my job's the opposite try to find things to do look i'll go to the toilet drag that out for as long as you possibly can
S0253	our bathroom's dead small
S0254	mm
S0253	but no the thing be like i wouldn't eat like you know i don't snack and i don't really eat like load but like bring in like she's such a keen foodie an d baker and she erm she bring in like she make at home do i tell you this the other day she make fudge she make fudge at home
S0254	that's insane
S0253	like chocolate
S0254	like who make fudge at home
S0253	fudge american people do
S0254	nice yeah americans do
S0253	cos americans do know how to enjoy their food english people would be like i couldn't possibly make fudge at home
S0254	i wouldn't know where to start make fudge
S0253	and she make stuff like cinnamon toast for breakfast that you fry it's like
S0254	fry bread
S0253	fry bread in sugar and cinnamon
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's beautiful it be nice i have it
S0254	oh yeah i'm sure it be
S0253	she make it for me once but i think it's the attitude it's like if you're gonna make something indulge make it indulgent don't like
S0254	well you have to do it half half
S0253	yeah don't you know sort of like feel guilty for have a dessert it's go to be a dessert
S0254	might as well enjoy it
S0253	but yeah so she bring in this big tub of fudge and i would never think to myself if i be i sit there on my own i'd never think get i really fancy some fudge now but she put it the minute the it's also the anonymity thing
S0254	yeah
S0253	like in the staffroom in our staffroom
S0254	do she have a little label on it say eat me
S0253	yeah but it's not about it's not anonymous in our office cos there's only she and i who you know if someone's eat two thirds of the fudge it's one of us erm so like but and she you know i just sit there with it it must have be there like one afternoon for an extra hour or so so i just put erm that's a penalty and erm so like i just sit there and like i didn't really think about it i be fill in paper work bite of fudge fill in paper work bite of fudge and next thing i know i've eat like a good chunk of this tub
S0254	this be it be that like mindless eat isn't it
S0253	yeah
S0254	that's why i get that app
S0253	i'll just have one more i'll just have one
S0254	yeah
S0253	i'll just have one more
S0254	that's why i get that app cos i think how much do i actually eat be i consume more calories than i'm actually use cos i and especially it's like a desk job i'm just sit at a computer when i be on the dowie i be move around you know play with the kid
S0253	yeah
S0254	you're up you hardly ever sit down
S0253	no
S0254	so then you think i can have that slide of cake in the kitchen cos i'm on my feet move around all day but when you sit at a computer it's actually like you really need many calories so i just
S0253	yeah
S0254	out of interest want to check and see that i think
S0253	oh what a strike that be he's amaze that fella yo see this one before
S0254	no it's a bite
S0253	he's have two wonder strike that be
S0254	wonder strike lyric
S0253	they slow down and the music play lyric erm
S0254	muse
S0253	laugh what's that song call
S0254	sing
S0253	sing like a something
S0254	song bird
S0253	no
S0254	showbiz
S0253	no that go no
S0254	it's an early album
S0253	lyric just want to lyric doo doo doo like a be it new bear
S0254	ah yes
S0253	be i right
S0254	you're right ah clap
S0253	doctor mick laugh
S0254	good effort doctor mick
S0253	top defend there by who be that
S0254	dunno
S0253	oh it's gary cahill what be it look at the pace of gary cahill there jeez what be it about food
S0254	erm so yeah then i like foolishly think that the amount of calories for a female per day be actually two thousand five hundred and not two thousand so i think right i'll see if i can eat one and i'll just cut it down a little bite so i can like
S0253	yeah
S0254	just lose a little bite for weight like one thousand two hundred calories cos i be think that's nearly three hundred calories less
S0253	yeah
S0254	than normal that shouldn't effect me too bad start to feel really ill and really lie tire and then realise that actually the average be amount be two thousand calories so i be
S0253	what's for men
S0254	eight hundred less two thousand five hundred
S0253	but do you not feel like i don't know i always feel like you know sort of these kind of it's like five a day and units of alcohol and this amount of units per day and this be what you should be eat who come up with these things i know it's like food
S0254	dieticians
S0253	dieticians and nutritionists and all that shit but it's humans aren't like one size fit all sort of thing it's not like
S0254	well no but they've do
S0253	er
S0254	they do study don't they and to find like
S0253	okay
S0254	in general people who eat five portion of fruit and veg a day
S0253	mm
S0254	live longer now they're say like seven aren't they but
S0253	but but that logic be nonsense er because it it er doesn't take how much how much time these people spend in cars do these people smoke
S0254	yeah
S0253	how much alcohol do they drink
S0254	no exactly
S0253	but what what it's basically say be if we live on a diet of fresh fruit and no one eat anything no one do anything apart from sit in a room and eat fresh fruit
S0253	then people who eat more fresh fruit would
S0254	no
S0253	live longer than the people who didn't eat fresh fruit and even then there'd be congenital variables in it
S0254	exactly
S0253	it's nonsense
S0254	yeah yeah but that's the recommend daily amount
S0253	yeah and er and er i i get it like er i get the idea of like you know people like to see like little build block and like to say oh i've have my five a day today
S0254	yeah
S0253	but
S0254	i mean when you think of that in term of like a campaign that be like really like cleverly do everyone know five a day now don't they everyone go on about five a day i mean people
S0253	do i do i follow it
S0254	well no okay people don't follow it but they're you know it's it's a really well recognise thing isn't it
S0253	yeah
S0254	and that's through a campaign
S0253	that little logo on the do you know like
S0254	yeah
S0253	i swear it's on the side of a bottle of appletiser
S0253	sugary drink
S0254	well you know that erm gluten free cake i make last week
S0253	yeah
S0254	i be like two of your five a day in that cake and they be like what and i be like mash potato
S0254	and lemon
S0254	forget about the sugar
S0253	be it veg as well
S0254	no well potatoes don't count and i don't know why something to do with the starch content
S0253	wait no so no but veg count for like
S0254	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0253	i i
S0254	fruit and veg
S0253	do i i must get like my five a day
S0254	so what have you have what do you have for breakfast chocolate cereal
S0253	choco crunch or whatever

S0254	so that probably doesn't count
S0253	i mean i i be bite into it yesterday and like er er today and like the the chocolate in it be so bad it's like you know when you get like
S0254	the cheapest chocolate
S0253	you know you get you know you get like an easter egg off like an aunt
S0253	that's like just really
S0254	that doesn't like you

S0254	mm
S0253	that's what the salt be that that's all that that flavour be
S0254	yeah

S0254	it's just something to aim for i suppose isn't it
S0253	huh
S0254	and the other thing be you either do or you don't
S0253	but but why er but it's so but it's so arbitrary like why focus on like you know er you know so it's like it's like measure of alcohol like you know units units per week like you know people should not exceed x amount of alcohol per week and things like that and it's like but why focus on these things what about you know next thing it'll be like you know don't have er you know remember like the salt content thing for a while do you remember that and it be like have that have jenny eclair on the advert and it be like
S0254	yeah

S0253	why why not say like and let's be honest let's like like er you know i read i read a study i don't i think it be by by lambert and butler who say that smoke in your twenties
S0254	oh be okay
S0253	it's not that it's okay i mean it's obviously
S0254	you can recover from it
S0253	it's not as good as not smoke but smoke in your twenties be like sort of what's the word negligible in term of the damage cause
S0254	yeah
S0253	than smoke like late er late in your thirties and you know but huh at the moment they why why be it why do it say anything why do we regulate and say anything and say okay well like or why do we have these initiatives like don't eat so much of this don't eat do so much of this but then other things that should be sort of curb i suppose there's just a blanket ban on cigarettes isn't there it's er it's a blanket no no
S0254	mm
S0253	but then
S0254	too much er of a grey area isn't it and i suppose they're addictive
S0253	no it's not it's no it's
S0254	they're addictive as well i suppose that's the thing isn't it so the but er i don't know like sugar's probably more addictive than cigarettes but erm they they do deserve a goal i think switzerland
S0253	switzerland have be brilliant
S0254	erm
S0253	it's er it's not it's not that it's a grey area i mean the i think the facts be there it's the fact that like there's just be so much misinformation spread over the years
S0254	yeah
S0253	and it's just even now
S0254	but yeah i think it er it's because it's addictive isn't it
S0253	mm
S0254	so they can say oh yeah smoke in you twenties that's fine it's like that would be fine if people then stop but then by that point a lot of people be addict and then it's more difficult for them
S0253	yeah it's too hard to it's too hard to give up
S0254	to stop so they carry on then and then they start to do damage
S0253	it's
S0254	so it's easier to say no don't start isn't it
S0253	it's interest to see cigarette stuff do you remember the scare stories when it be like
S0254	yeah there's things there call for ban on them
S0253	yeah but who's call for ban on them
S0254	i don't know but it's like somebody set fire to themselves
S0253	yeah one person
S0254	yeah cos they add oxygen in
S0253	i wonder how many forest fire have be start by cigarettes
S0254	oh yeah too many yeah oh
S0253	oh yeah wasn't it some fella
S0254	he be on an oxygen machine
S0253	yeah and what happen to it oh the
S0254	he set fire to the oxygen
S0253	a cigarette wouldn't of do that if you light a cigarette
S0254	if he'd light cigarette yeah but there's no natural naked flame be there on a cigarette
S0253	on a lighter there be
S0254	if you light a cigarette like that
S0253	yeah sure he be do it with his mind it would of have the same effect can't really
S0254	the clear he might as well of carry on smoke cigarettes cos he be already on oxygen so switch to an e cigarette then seem a bite pointless really doesn't it the damage have
S0253	surely that's a penalty
S0254	already be do
S0253	that a penally
S0254	who's that
S0253	fabien delph
S0254	who's he
S0253	i think he play for aston villa he always do he round on our fantasy league but i never really like the look of him
S0254	not sure if they're look
S0253	i think he's a good player but erm you know i just always wonder if you see these stories about oh e cigarettes be dangerous sorry they're just never go to be as dangerous as
S0254	no they're not it's people like your mum and dad
S0253	yeah
S0254	and i think they would of go back to smoke have it not be for e cigarettes and you just think oh yeah alright completely replace them that's fine it can't be more harmful you know it probably would be better to give up altogether but you know if you have the choice between the two i know which one i would rather people do
S0253	mm
S0254	it's get to be better isn't it
S0253	roy hodgson need to calm down he look like he look sick with anger so yeah so
S0254	cos he probably get sack if they don't win
S0253	well he would of get sack after the world cup if they don't qualify or get out of the group stage for the euros he'll get sack after i'm worry about the euros more than the world cup
S0254	there's not go to be much expectations
S0253	yeah but that be that be disastrous
S0254	oh do he knee him in the back be that what happen there
S0253	i watch
S0254	he kneed him in the back
S0253	the euros i watch one game with and and that in dedsbury

S0254	that's bad
S0253	i'd hit my head that night that's why i be so weird
S0254	yeah
S0253	think it be the air well it be the air
S0254	a bite
S0253	a bite of both but erm yeah it's not awful it's just down the motorway and it sound daft but it's like
S0254	yeah i suppose maybe
S0253	i don't quite understand the logistics of it if it's not a hackney but i mean cos it be a hackney
S0254	oh
S0253	i just walk outside the station and that be more can you take us to spital and the guy be like get in but we just shoot down the motorway so it didn't seem that long whereas if you kind of
S0254	it's not like it doesn't take us that long to get from my dads
S0253	but it be distance it's not time be it or be it time
S0254	erm i think it be distance
S0253	or be it a bite of both cos sometimes it go up again
S0254	it be yeah if you're in a traffic jam yeah i don't know dunno
S0253	yeah i be just i
S0254	yeah
S0253	i could see why want it in chester just to make it a bite different it's
S0254	it'll be nice to get to that church
S0253	why do everyone tell me chester's really rough at night
S0254	yeah dunno probably be
S0253	how i don't understand how rough be it
S0254	just fight no rougher than really
S0253	but i still don't understand what that mean it's rough at night
S0254	well it's like
S0253	be it like the warriors the seventies gang film people
S0254	game like hunger game
S0253	hunger game
S0254	just tribes come out
S0253	i have this image of and it's nothing but a scene from mum years she once saw like they be drive in chester and they be someone walk round like swing a chain but her memory of that have become my memory of it
S0254	yeah
S0253	and i didn't see it nor would that indicate any kind of violence it could have be a cyclists
S0254	yeah
S0253	anything
S0254	a chain
S0253	a daisy chain
S0254	yeah
S0253	but yeah she as just i saw a man swing a chain so i didn't i just i don't one of those things that's like everyone say how rough chester be
S0254	yeah i dunno it's just one of those things
S0253	be it like when people say anywhere well they're not from be bad
S0254	well yeah cos if you weren't use to go out in liverpool you'd think it be terrible
S0253	yeah
S0254	i think we just gotta be vigilant
S0253	yeah think so
S0253	don't walk around on your own
S0254	yeah definitely go to you could go to the botanists there and you could there
S0253	not really a stag do kind of place
S0254	you could go to the church
S0253	these be all terrible place to go on a stag do
S0254	not be there with me the church the church be convert into a bar its really nice inside have you not be that's really nice you should go there
S0253	it's with your other man
S0254	i go with dad an and then i go with but i think you be with me one time
S0253	maybe i have be
S0254	you'd remember it cos it be a church that's now get a bar in the middle of it it still look like a church it's get a bar in the middle of it
S0253	yeah it still be a church it's just get a bar in it
S0254	yeah must have be there
S0253	dead awkward on sundays during mass yeah no erm john will know what he's do with it
S0254	yeah or his brother
S0253	well it's i think this will be his brothers kind of thing
S0254	yeah should be i feel like i need to get back on it with the hen do
S0253	with 's
S0254	yeah
S0253	why you've pretty much do everything a year in advance
S0254	not really i've buy we've book a place i haven't decide i need to start lie tell them what i want to do be allow people to pay in instalments so instead of in february say i need a hundred quid from everybody cos everyone's always skint after christmas say can i have a bite of money before
S0253	yeah
S0254	and a bite of money after
S0253	yeah
S0254	spread the cost little bite
S0253	make sense
S0254	but i need to decide what activities we're gonna do so that i can add a bite of that into the cost
S0253	i think it's sensible to not to try and get all that money off people at once cos be you go to have to sort this yourself
S0254	yeah i'm go to have to chase the money
S0253	well don't book it until you get money off people
S0254	yeah
S0253	i know that sound stupid but otherwise people take advantage like people still haven't pay like i already pay she's like just pay it
S0254	yeah
S0253	you know
S0254	i've pay it so i don't feel bad about that now
S0253	yeah
