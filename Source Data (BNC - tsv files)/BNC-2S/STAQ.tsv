S0208	didn't fully understand so all i know be that it's some way of your body keep you healthy cos something about fill up the tissue with new blood and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	it help it stay healthy and it stop you from get erectile dysfunction
S0202	well they get like seven or eight blow job
S0208	they're lucky
S0202	erection er erections a night don't they like
S0208	yeah it's something ridiculous like
S0202	it's it's not just in the morning do you know what i find really weird as well like you probably get the same with but do you know when you don't have sex for a long time and like you first meet each other and like don't you think that hard on be harder than what it usually be if you're have sex all the time
S0208	yeah it be
S0202	do that make sense and it's bigger as well
S0208	they've get more desire for yeah like oh sometimes when and i haven't do it it get so big i'm like oh my
S0202	yeah
S0208	but erm
S0202	well 's not like he's not massive but he's not small he's get he's just get the right size i think
S0208	yeah
S0202	like isn't my ex boyfriend be huge like
S0208	i don't like that
S0202	ridiculously big
S0208	no 's a nice size it's not too big
S0202	have a complex though when we first get together that er he think he be small
S0208	oh
S0202	like he think it like cos he say he's obviously see other boys' penises when they've be in shower and that and his just seem small i comparison
S0208	oh but to be completely honest i'd rather have a guy with a slightly smaller than average penis than a slightly bigger because can you imagine a it's painful
S0202	well
S0208	b it stretch you out
S0202	yeah
S0208	and you can't really do the same stuff like can
S0202	well
S0208	get in place
S0202	yeah
S0208	that a bigger penis couldn't
S0202	yeah well the he isn't small but like it it take us like be together for two years before he'd tell me what his complex be
S0208	oh bless him
S0202	and then after that i just use to take piss out of him like ha ha small dick
S0202	and he he get over it straight away
S0208	ah
S0202	like the that's how i get rid of all his like insecurities like just take the piss out of him and straight away he's like ha ha funny
S0208	that's good
S0202	but i i think that be the way to deal with it like if you've get an insecurity about yourself take the piss out of it like that's why i take the piss out of my manly voice and like my big nose like when that fly land on it like
S0208	that's what i do with my forehead
S0202	do you know what i mean
S0208	make joke about fly to china
S0202	yeah
S0208	i mean it's hurtful when other people do it
S0202	well if they do it viciously
S0208	but i do it myself it's like even when people do it as a joke i still find it helpful cos i'm like i'm the only person that can laugh about that you're not allow to
S0202	i'm allow cos i'm your best friend i've get a so
S0208	mm
S0202	i don't have a receive hairline either my hairline keep get like closer to my eyebrows

S0208	mm
S0202	everyone people say to me oh you should do blah blah and like yeah maybe i be but it's a personal thing and
S0208	mm
S0202	my way of deal with it be take the piss out of it
S0208	it's like people who you look at and you think be absolutely perfect they still have insecurities
S0202	mm
S0208	and just cos you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there it's like i be tell you how 's really insecure about her body because she find it too slim and stuff it's like you would never look at her and think she be insecure
S0202	no
S0208	but she be
S0202	i would never tell her she have an amaze body either only cos i'm jealous
S0208	she wouldn't even accept it

S0202	it's not hostile
S0208	mm
S0202	it's not a hostile environment

S0202	yeah
S0208	cos i know that he just need that little bite of space to cool off i need that little bite of space to not keep be piss off at him
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then it's fine
S0202	yeah cos er i mean i love don't get me wrong and i really do love him but like you you can only spend a certain amount of time with someone before they start piss you off

S0202	like normal like little things you deal with piss me off like one he be come he come i'd not see him for like a week or something but i get piss off cos he be come home late from work and stuff and it's just like why be i get piss off about that i would never normally be bother but it be just because we'd spend so much time together and then like i be get piss off at little things that i shouldn't have be get piss off about
S0208	but there be though there be little things that annoy you that it it happen to me and i get annoy and i'm just like why be i angry
S0202	yeah
S0208	there's no reason to be angry and it be just because you've just be around for too long i think
S0202	yeah yeah it's
S0208	oh there's two lizards on the wall down by the pool house
S0202	oh yeah
S0208	on the on the crack in by the ceiling they're so cute i love them
S0202	they go so move so fast don't they
S0208	mm oh one find a fly
S0208	they're so sweet though i remember when we live in the there be one on my kitchen floor and my dad accidentally tread on its tail
S0202	oh
S0208	and it run away but well lizards like the i think they're the only animal that can actually regrow limbs
S0202	yeah they can yeah
S0208	so like i always know about their tail but their legs as well
S0202	yeah they can grow anything yeah
S0208	they can regrow legs which be so cool
S0202	it must be so painful though
S0208	yeah but can you imagine like oh no i lose an arm okay give it a week i'll have another one

S0208	mm
S0202	i would want someone just to end it all because that be not a life that's an existence
S0208	i reckon if i be like paraplegic it would be hard but it would be liveable because you'd still be mobile in the top
