S0324	oh
S0325	and he be like oh he's just a bite
S0324	weird
S0325	and then even mr be like physics teachers be a bite weird don't tell mr like it's like
S0324	yes
S0325	you're a bite weird
S0324	all i think all science teachers be slightly weird
S0325	they're complete weirdo apart from like mr he's like completely normal actually
S0324	yeah well he be
S0325	i dunno cos i don't have him do you remember when he be
S0324	he be a bite
S0325	call his wife he be like i'll put on a nice lamb for you tonight

S0325	who else be there miss i love miss she's literally
S0324	yeah
S0325	i love her but she's so bad
S0324	yeah she's really nice she's a really nice person
S0325	yeah she's probably like one of my favourite like teachers she's so funny
S0324	yeah
S0325	i just love her but
S0324	she's just not a very good
S0325	teacher
S0324	like actual teacher
S0325	i know she just
S0324	go
S0325	she's like
S0324	way too fast and
S0325	she's like mr
S0324	yeah
S0325	mr 's not a very good actual teacher because he's a musician and musicians be always like he know what he's do
S0324	yeah
S0325	and he expect everyone else to know what he's do but what they're do but no one know what they're do and they're like what's happen i don't really understand
S0324	yeah yeah so he just like expect you to understand
S0325	yeah but he think everyone that do music be automatically like already be already like really clever and so we turn up to theory he's like be you get this be you get you're get this
S0324	yeah
S0325	okay er he won't even ask he'll be like right you're get this you're get this i'm like i'm not get it
S0325	i'm not get
S0325	because you pick it up really quickly when we didn't do any of our homework and i'm still there like hold on a minute wait what's a cadence
S0324	yeah but then i've kind of feel sorry for everyone that hasn't do grade five theory today have to
S0325	yeah
S0324	like have to try and understand him go right this be one this be
S0324	four this be five
S0325	mm
S0324	these be the main ones
S0324	this be how you do a no he it's not even this be how you do a cadence it's just
S0325	this be a
S0324	chord five to one be a perfect cadence
S0324	chord four to one be an imperfect cadence
S0324	this sound like a full stop this sound like a comma
S0325	a
S0324	right
S0325	this be a semicolon
S0324	next
S0325	yeah but to be honest everyone else i look so much more confuse than everyone else everyone else be just lap it up they be just write it all down like uhu yeah uhu and i just feel like wait hold on a sec can you what do that say
S0324	yeah cos
S0325	wait a minute
S0324	cos i bet they weren't even try to understand it
S0325	yeah
S0324	just write it down and
S0325	or they all just understand like
S0324	i didn't understand though
S0325	how do like i'm not try to be a bite
S0324	yeah
S0325	but be not
S0324	well why do he decide to take music
S0325	i don't know because drum yesterday he be really i think he's like quite enthusiastic about music because
S0324	i think he's one of those people that love listen to music
S0325	yeah like
S0324	so it mean that they think they be musical
S0325	yeah
S0324	and that they love music as a whole
S0325	i know
S0324	but just because they love listen to music
S0325	yeah like rock music
S0324	and like yeah and because especially if it's like mm not pop music
S0325	mm
S0324	and you think you're like really cool and you're like listen to pop music and you
S0325	yeah indie
S0324	er not
S0325	indie
S0324	pop yeah like indie
S0325	yeah
S0324	or r and b or
S0325	or marilyn manson
S0324	yeah and then you and then yeah i think that's my theory
S0325	yeah but he be like
S0324	so he think he's like really musical
S0325	yeah
S0324	and really into music but it's just because he like listen to music
S0325	mm
S0324	and he kind of play the drum but he's not even that good at play the drum
S0325	i know and we're all chat away and we're basically just like diss music erm me and be like oh yeah you don't know you don't wanna do like it sound like you don't wanna play the saxophone
S0324	who who be you till
S0325	erm
S0324	say this to
S0325	no no he be say that me i be like i wanna play the saxophone he be like no you don't wanna play so we be just chat about how rubbish the music be and then 's like erm so when's wind band when's choir when's jazz band do they need drummers for wind band erm and we're like no no they don't need drum just jazz band and he's like so jazz band's on tuesday we're like no no jazz band's on monday and he's like well i'll make sure i go to jazz band because if if i erm if i do that then i'll be more in the run for drummers at wind band because then they might not he might not pick me i'm like to be honest he just pick any old person
S0324	yeah
S0325	i be like it's not really a big deal for him
S0324	because there's only gonna be like one one drummer
S0325	yeah
S0324	that actually want to be
S0325	yeah
S0324	you know cos i always feel really sorry for the drummers
S0324	because
S0325	yeah
S0324	mr
S0325	yeah but
S0324	be so mean
S0325	to be honest it's good for him like he's really good now he must be way better
S0324	yeah i know
S0325	when he start he be rubbish
S0324	yeah
S0325	but now he must be really good
S0324	cos it's like the tough love
S0325	yeah
S0324	that's actually
S0325	it's like that film
S0324	a really good way of improve
S0325	you know that film with that guy from erm divergent in it and erm it's he's a drummer and the can i think it's call like the conductor it's not call the conductor but there's a conductor that's really horrible to him and say like you're fail like do you just not get this cos you're stupid that's like mr that just remind me of
S0324	i haven't see that film
S0325	i haven't see it either i just saw the advert
S0324	oh
S0325	but it's the same kind of thing i be like oh
S0324	what with erm theo jam
S0325	not theo jam

S0324	the whole way through she'll be like oh theo jam
S0325	mm
S0324	oh there's theo jam oh
S0325	yeah like even when we watch seventeen again she be like oh hello when zac efron come on and i'm like can you please stop and like yes i know i know he's really attractive but you don't need to be like oh like that every time he's on the screen
S0324	oh
S0325	but then didn't i think it be really depress at the end of that when it just go back to that old man
S0324	yeah and he be
S0325	because when zac efron say it it be so cute and like romantic and then it be just that old man like i'm in love with you
S0324	yeah
S0325	it's like
S0324	and he be like
S0325	oh
S0324	with his beer belly and then they
S0325	yeah
S0324	do the whole spin round thing again
S0325	yeah
S0324	like recreate it and he's like i'm gonna have to put you down now cos i'm not very strong any more
S0324	and he's like
S0325	and i be like
S0324	his beer belly
S0325	it's just literally just ruin the whole film for me
S0324	yeah
S0325	but it be basically just back to the future
S0324	yeah i know
S0325	they be like it's nothing like back to the future i'm like
S0324	because it's exactly the same
S0325	it's completely like back to the future
S0324	except instead of go backwards
S0325	yeah
S0324	he's go kind of forward in a way
S0325	yeah but it's like the same the back
S0324	but it's like he doesn't cos in back to the future he doesn't want to accidentally kiss his mum
S0325	yeah
S0324	and this be like he doesn't wanna accidentally
S0325	and
S0324	kiss his daughter
S0325	kiss his daughter
S0325	he's like his mum fancy him and his daughter fancy him and you're like well yeah cos in back to the future they go back in this they stay the same but he just change
S0324	yeah
S0325	and go back that creepy guy the guy on the bridge
S0324	that janitor
S0325	yeah that scar me so much
S0324	mm yeah that be so creepy
S0325	i literally i scream
S0325	when er erm when he be stand on the bridge in the dark be like oh that's his like spirit genie and i be like oh my god
S0325	and he turn around and he be like and i be like oh my god
S0324	and then he just like i think the lorry go past and then he's just go
S0325	go and i i be literally like
S0324	i be really scar when he it's like he go back in look for the janitor and then he's in that puddle of water and then he like follow the trail of water to that thing he's like hello i be really scar there
S0325	yeah i think the janitor be suddenly
S0324	ah
S0325	gonna like kill him or the janitor be so scary
S0324	but then it's like
S0325	and then at the end the janitor be like way hey
S0324	yeah
S0325	way
S0324	yeah
S0325	but it be like
S0324	yeah
S0325	that bite be weird like the flashback and then he be like oh like that and go like that and she be like oh my god
S0324	yeah that thing with the
S0325	oh my yeah
S0324	but then when he go like that he have like a massive arm there
S0325	yeah but at that point
S0324	but
S0325	i be like oh my god that's so cute but then he turn into that old man i be like oh
S0324	yeah yeah but also they look nothing the same
S0325	i know
S0324	i think it should have just be
S0325	i be like what happen
S0324	yeah
S0325	like
S0324	and also he's thirty seven
S0325	yeah
S0324	the guy
S0325	how do you know that
S0324	er because it
S0325	say
S0324	yeah or maybe it be just in the trailer or something
S0325	yeah
S0324	anyway it's the guy's thirty seven and he go back to be seventeen so seventeen she's pregnant so they all have a baby when they're seventeen and then the children be seventeen seventeen plus seventeen be
S0325	oh yeah one of the children be
S0324	not thirty seven
S0325	seventeen
S0324	yeah the daughter's seventeen
S0325	which mean she be pregnant when she be twenty
S0324	it be yeah
S0325	she be
S0324	but they're they're seventeen so it's three years out he should have be thirty four instead of thirty seven or something like that i don't know
S0325	oh
S0324	maths
S0325	yeah but be she pregnant when she be seventeen
S0324	yeah cos that's that's the whole reason that she that that that erm whatever zac efron erm didn't like walk out because she be pregnant you know at the begin when it's like the whole flashback thing no it's not flashback it's right at the begin
S0325	oh i didn't see the begin
S0324	you didn't see the begin
S0325	no i do put it on from the bite where they be in the garden and he be say the divorce isn't be no be only in two weeks
S0324	why
S0325	i dunno that be just where she start it
S0324	oh you have to see the begin cos then it all like add up cos like
S0325	oh
S0324	at the end it's exactly the same as the begin
S0325	so she be pregnant
S0324	yeah so at the begin
S0325	yeah
S0324	basically it's like a flashback to when they've both seventeen
S0325	yeah
S0324	and he's like amaze at basketball
S0325	yeah
S0324	erm and they and they have the so basically it start you know at the end and he's like warm it up score load of things and then the coach come in and be like oh save yourself and he's like oh just warm up and then he's like oh by the way there's a guy
S0325	yeah come yeah
S0324	the scout from there it's exactly the same in the begin
S0325	oh
S0324	so he's like warm up and then he's like oh just warm up and then he's like oh but there's a scout so if you play as half as well as you i know you can
S0325	yeah
S0324	or whatever but then just before he go and talk to his girlfriend which be the lady erm and she's like kind of upset and he's like oh what's the matter and she's like oh don't worry it's fine erm just go and play but and he's like no i'm not gonna play unless you're tell me what's wrong so she tell him that she's pregnant
S0325	yeah
S0324	so then he play but he doesn't play properly and he's like mm
S0325	yeah
S0324	and then she go and walk out
S0325	oh
S0324	he look at her and walk out because they basically break up because he want to go to college and play basketball
S0325	but she's pregnant
S0324	she's pregnant so then he in the middle of the game just suddenly walk out and follow her
S0325	yeah
S0324	and then she's like oh no go back your future be there you can go to college and he's like no my future be with you and the baby and then and then that's in that corridor and then they kiss and then they like do that twirly thing and that's why at the end he's like right i'm gonna have to put you down now i'm not as strong as i use to be
S0325	oh okay i get it
S0324	and that's why they get divorce because he always keep go on about how erm
S0325	he could have
S0324	he could have
S0325	go to
S0324	if he didn't
S0324	he could have be a successful basketball player basically
S0325	oh right yeah i get it now but then but also
S0324	so the whole film you should have watch the begin i can't believe just didn't show you the begin
S0325	but also that coach it have be twenty years he be like the best basketballer on the team and the coach didn't recognise him
S0324	i know cos it's exactly the same coach
S0325	nobody recognise him mm
S0324	it's just a slightly different haircut
S0325	mm
S0324	why wouldn't you i guess cos it's like so unrealistic

S0324	cos they're like the wife recognise him think he be
S0325	yeah she be like you look just like my husband when i be
S0324	seventeen
S0325	when he be seventeen
S0324	and he's like mm yeah
