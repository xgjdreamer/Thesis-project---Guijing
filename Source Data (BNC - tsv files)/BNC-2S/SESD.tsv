S0253	what's the poppy run
S0254	er it's only five k er and they're do them around and about there's not that many in the north west though the closest one to us be
S0253	relate to
S0254	relate to poppies as in like remembrance world war
S0253	yeah
S0254	so i think the money go to like war veterans or
S0253	yeah yeah
S0254	mm what's the name of the charity help for heroes
S0253	help for heroes
S0254	erm so yeah so i think the money go to that and stuff but i mean it's only i think it's fifteen pound to enter and then erm and it's only five k so i think it would just get me a bite of motivation
S0253	mm
S0254	to start run although say that i do think right i should go tonight as well and i be like oh i just i can't be bother
S0253	i'm really bad
S0254	it's dark and it's cold and it's wet and i just think i do my time
S0253	i do my time
S0254	i do seventeen miles in the wind and the wet on your own for three hours or something and it be just horrible i can't shake that
S0253	no
S0254	even half and hour's now you'd think you'd be like oh yeah half an hour that's fine i can do that but no i just don't wanna do anymore
S0253	yeah i genuinely don't know what's wrong with my motivation i mean i think my general motivation hit rock bottom a few months ago and then i dunno i just i can't get like i would like to start run again i just cannot make myself
S0254	mm
S0253	it's horrible but i think you have to kind of have like a moment where you're like oh i erm i'm really
S0254	mm
S0253	unhealthy or you've gotta have
S0254	yeah
S0253	an incentive
S0254	well that's what that's it that's why i think if i sign up to this then that might give me a little bite of incentive cos i'll want to do it in under half an hour
S0253	yeah
S0254	erm so yeah so i think i could do like three run this week and then obviously i'm away next week cos it's on the twenty sixth so it's not that far away really but i think i'll try and get a few run in
S0253	yeah
S0254	but it think i wanna start do different stuff really i still miss spin i should just bite the bullet and
S0253	get the gym membership
S0254	yeah but just i dunno it just seem like a lot of money that isn't a necessity
S0254	erm
S0253	but now you're support your man
S0254	now i'm the breadwinner
S0253	but you're you always be the breadwinner
S0253	nothing's change there
S0254	but yeah so i dunno i quite like the idea of like badminton and stuff i think we should start do that
S0253	i'd be i'd be definitely up for that
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's like you be say the other day i think we both just need like a kick up the arse but then
S0254	i think there's a lot to be say about like cos i haven't really run at all since i move in with you and think it's i dunno i think it's just that i don't wanna go out on my own really i'd just rather be in with you
S0253	yeah
S0254	in front of the telly i'd be more likely to do it if you go with me
S0253	yeah
S0254	cos i when i be in and stuff like in the like be never really around much anyway but
S0253	you'd go with or something
S0254	yeah i'd go with or like i'd text her in the day and be like you know do you wanna go for a run maybe go for a run when i get in or there'd be nobody in when you get in so it would be like well there's not really anything to do there's no one to talk to so
S0253	mm
S0254	i'd just be more likely to go for a run whereas cos you're always you're here when i get in
S0253	yeah
S0254	i just wanna sit and have a chat and have a cup of tea and then by the time i've do all that i've completely lose any motivation to go out or
S0253	yeah
S0254	go for a run and when you're settle down like settle in and it's nice and warm and you just don't wanna go out again do you
S0253	no
S0254	i mean i really enjoy it on sunday so i don't know like
S0253	i
S0254	as i'm run i'm like you should do this more often it would get easier and you would start to enjoy it again
S0253	it would it it do get easier
S0254	yeah it do i just i can't seem to carry that forward
S0253	no er i think it be just so off put isn't the first time
S0254	mm i mean it
S0254	wasn't off put it be a nice day yeah sort of hard work but that's alright yeah i'm try to get well i've ask me dad if he want to go and play racquetball too
S0253	yeah
S0254	so hopefully we can do that soon that'll be fun
S0253	yeah i think it's just try try to form the habit isn't it and then get and get into like a routine of of do activity and do sport
S0254	yeah that's
S0253	but
S0254	the only thing be you've gotta get in the in the habit
S0253	yeah
S0254	build it into your routine
S0253	i think i'll end up do the inevitable like my first week of unemployment i'll be like go for run and stuff like that and you know i've gotta keep busy and
S0254	that's good
S0253	it's such a clich√© though isn't it like
S0254	not really it's just stuff that you wanna do where you don't have time when you're in work
S0253	yeah
S0254	enjoy it it won't last long
S0253	mm i'm not sure
S0254	mm oh he's not advertise his oh god
S0253	what just
S0254	i be moan about him er and then pull pork on a pizza
S0253	pull pork on a pizza
S0254	yeah
S0253	pull pork
S0254	there pull pork everywhere
S0253	everything pull pork everything
S0253	tea
S0254	oh you reckon you can get like pull pork teabags
S0253	give it time
S0253	as i say the ones that make me laugh be like pull pork crisp
S0254	yeah
S0253	it's like i mean do ever crisp ever taste like i dunno they just taste like
S0254	it's just barbeque isn't it
S0253	it's yes yeah
S0254	barbeque
S0253	but
S0254	flavour crisp
S0253	do you know there's like there's load of research do and you know like do you know when you you know when you look at a can of like a can of lilt
S0254	yeah oh god i haven't have lilt for age do they still make that
S0253	i i think so but the isn't that the the the think behind that be because certain certain colour like before we've even open a product or eat something
S0254	yeah
S0253	certain colour tell our brain certain things
S0254	if they're a certain yeah
S0253	so this be like years of study have do this since like
S0254	yeah yeah
S0253	it's and it's kind of what they call a synaesthesia
S0254	yeah i suppose so yeah
S0253	a colour a colour can't taste refresh but we just
S0254	yellow and
S0253	there's associations base on
S0254	yeah
S0253	maybe it's base on nature
S0254	yellow and green
S0253	yellow and green isn't it that kind of crisp and refresh
S0254	yeah
S0253	whereas like you know we've get
S0254	it's like they've make the
S0253	why be red hot
S0254	coke green now haven't they not like actually green but there's a coke call coke green
S0253	right and what's the
S0254	which be erm
S0253	what's the gimmick
S0254	it's it's natural like
S0253	oh piss
S0254	like
S0253	off
S0254	natural sugar or something
S0253	natural sugar
S0254	yeah
S0253	isn't that bad for you as well
S0254	well it's still sugar isn't it
S0253	sugar be sugar
S0254	or natural sweetener maybe i be watch one of those
S0254	horizony program though
S0253	get off
S0254	about it and their thing be yeah this be the you know they be say at first this can't be much better for you than normal sugar and then they do load of research into it and they find out that the natural sweeteners
S0253	uhu
S0254	actually be real things like it be a plant that grow that
S0253	well we
S0254	they can
S0253	we watch it with that woman
S0254	yeah
S0253	when she travel to it be on
S0254	yeah
S0253	it be on food unwrap
S0254	like brazil
S0253	it be
S0254	yeah that's what it be
S0253	yeah
S0254	cos they be like well be it just refine fake chemically stuff that they're put in but it be actually it be actually natural
S0253	a natural sweetener
S0254	yeah so that's what they put in coke now apparently
S0253	er oh
S0254	i've never see anything
S0253	tobacco's natural you don't chew it do you
S0254	well some people do
S0253	yeah exactly it's just
S0253	some people oh anyway
S0253	erm what be i gonna say yeah but
S0253	so i i always think like i just think if you put on a bag of crisp obviously there's like spectrums of flavour
S0254	mm
S0253	so like there'd be like a kind of a degree of like chicken rennet or whatever they put in it like for chicken
S0254	oh
S0253	whatever they put
S0254	yeah
S0253	whatever they make the chicken flavour out of
S0254	oh
S0253	or beef
S0254	yeah i don't like to think
S0253	or
S0254	of it
S0253	prawn cocktail but i just think
S0254	prawn cocktail's
S0253	but i just think if
S0254	like paprika really
S0253	you
S0254	isn't it
S0253	put a kind of meaty kind of taste on something
S0254	mm
S0253	colour the bag like pink and say it's prawn and your brain when you chew your crisp you go
S0254	yeah
S0253	oh prawn cocktail like ah yes it taste like prawn
S0254	mm yes
S0253	be it chicken i mean i dunno i dunno if chicken crisp do taste like chicken
S0254	mm they do taste weird
S0253	it's not chicken though
S0254	i use to like chicken chicken flavour crisp you don't really get do you get chicken walkers still
S0253	yeah
S0254	haven't have them for a while
S0253	i mean i dunno the i think salt and vinegar's fair but you know the way it's like green like why do you just know it's salt and vinegar's green isn't it blue no it's like a light blue isn't it
S0254	no it's green in walkers but everywhere else it's blue
S0253	mm
S0254	although say that the aldi version be now green cos it use to be walkers be opposite but i think now they've all come in line with walkers and salt and vinegar be green and cheese and onion be blue
S0253	what's barbeque
S0254	black
S0253	black like
S0254	chargrilled
S0253	chargrilled
S0253	yeah but it's funny isn't it how like the the packet i think the package do half the work sometimes i think you just but if you saw a black packet you'd be like oh this be barbequey
S0254	yeah
S0253	oh it's brown oh this be this be bacon
S0254	what's it what's the purple one worcester sauce
S0253	worcester sauce in our in our set it's worcester sauce
S0254	yeah
S0253	that just make sense
S0254	why be that purple
S0253	dunno it taste like purple
S0253	when when
S0254	or do it taste like purple cos it's in a purple bag
S0253	i dunno you're blow
S0253	blow my mind man
S0253	why when
S0254	mm
S0253	when we be in erm the curry house the other week in there be a thing and it be erm it be green it be like this dip no one know what it be so everyone be dip into it but everyone agree that it didn't taste like green which be quite worry really i think we'd all sort of have this break this sort of synaesthesia moment and we be like
S0254	yeah
S0253	it doesn't but everyone everyone just agree it should taste red it should be red
S0254	it should have be like be it tomato sauce or something
S0253	no it wasn't tomatoey it just er no one could quite understand or like a purple like a dark purple it be sweet and very strange but it just didn't green be kind of like a natural
S0254	it didn't taste natural
S0253	no it didn't taste like anything that be grow it taste very much like something with a lot of sugar and a lot of
S0254	yeah
S0253	sweetener and a lot of spice in it
S0254	oh
S0253	it be dead strange but everyone be just like pass it around like
S0254	yeah
S0253	what like colour do you think that be
S0254	what colour would that be
S0253	yeah
S0254	that's interest unless they like blindfold people
S0253	when
S0254	like to taste they like do a blindfold taste and say like what colour food do you think that be
S0253	do we organise a blindfold
S0254	no not we but do they
S0253	who
S0254	whoever do that research
S0253	in the curry house
S0254	oh do you say you
S0253	yes
S0254	oh okay i think you say like something you'd read
S0253	no
S0254	oh okay oh weird
S0253	rather strange set

S0253	for a clinical research
S0253	a curry house
S0254	we take everyone to the curry house
S0253	yeah
S0254	i can understand that be a good piece of research

S0254	i can't feel like this week's go really slowly
S0253	i've just kind of i dunno track out a bite

S0253	redevelop my callus
S0254	yeah another thing to do god you won't have time for work
S0253	with all my project

S0253	get a joke for you
S0254	go on
S0253	what do you call a freelancer without a girlfriend
S0254	i don't know
S0253	homeless
S0254	oh
S0253	oh
S0254	it's funny cos it's true
S0253	yeah
S0254	mm
S0253	oh
S0254	mm
S0253	i dunno i'm not i'm not i be nervous about find a job
S0254	nervous excite
S0253	no not in the not in the not in the meantime i'm not nervous excite i'm just sort of nervous
S0254	mm yeah
S0253	like i know in the end it's a it's good thing but or it will be a good thing cos it always be but i'm just erm you know i guess it's that thing be like you know i spend tonight just look through like
S0254	mm
S0253	possible job and there ain't much about
S0254	well
S0253	but then i i don't really have much faith in like you know when you know when you go on like a website and it's like like the university's website it's like you click on it and it's like apply early we
S0254	yeah
S0253	we top we stop take on after a hundred applications and just like
S0254	mm
S0253	you realise it's that reminder i guess it's that reminder of what what you're
S0254	what you're up against
S0253	what you're up against sometimes
S0254	yeah
S0253	erm
S0254	same with us mm
S0253	but i guess the thing and and i'm so base on my experience of like be you know look for work before but things be so different now
S0254	yeah i think things be different and your experience be different and you're in a better position you know we're older we've be you know you've be work for nearly four years
S0253	uhu
S0254	not like we're fresh face graduate anymore
S0253	but that's kind of scarier because
S0254	no it's not i don't think so
S0253	no
S0254	it'll be good
S0253	so what be you base thursday on why why have give thursday as your estimate
S0254	erm because they say they say on the website that erm applicants will be inform by email no earlier than the fifteenth of october
S0253	okay
S0254	and do not contact the university before the sixteenth so i think if they don't get email out everyone's just gonna ring up on thursday aren't they well i won't but people will do surely just like i want to i'm just wonder blah blah blah blah blah
S0253	yeah but then don't but don't read it too much into it if you don't get a
S0254	yeah but then there's things like erm the they only request a reference if you get an interview and the reference have to be in by the twenty fifth of twenty fourth of october so that's next friday so they've get to give people at least a week to write a reference it's a bite harsh if they don't
S0253	so do you think your tutor would you she get in touch with you if she'd be contact
S0254	i would have to get in contact i think it's my responsibility to get reference
S0253	so so what they will contact you and say you've get an interview get a reference
S0254	provide reference yeah contact your reference and get them to
S0253	have you speak
S0254	put them in
S0253	have you speak to that woman who you normally speak to
S0254	erm my personal
S0253	tutor
S0254	tutor erm i haven't tell her about that one i've get to
S0253	well hadn't you better you'd better give her a head up
S0254	yeah well i will do if i get a thing
S0253	do you think she'd be like ready to do it like
S0254	yeah she'd just copy and paste what she's write for my doctorate ones probably and then i'm gonna get my old boss to write one and i tell her age ago and she be like yes yes of course i would of course i would erm so that's good
S0253	okay
S0254	and she'd write a good one
S0253	so you're not worry about get hold of a reference
S0254	no i just need two reference the only reason i be so panicky about that other reference be because on your doctorate they'll base shortlist
S0253	right
S0254	on your reference whereas in this case i'll have already be shortlist do you know what i mean
S0253	so you you're take out one stage of say process
S0254	uhu obviously if you two completely rubbish reference then they're not gonna they be not gonna put you on the course but
S0253	how do
S0254	if you have decent reference and then come across quite well in your interview then you've get a pretty good chance i don't even know how many people they interview
S0253	yeah
S0254	or anything i mean i'm for seventeen place what would you say about sixty people maybe
S0253	yeah
S0254	sixty out of two hundred so that's one in three four
S0253	yeah
S0254	one in three and a half i will be upset if i don't get an interview because i think
S0253	i know but like
S0254	i've get such a lot of experience in that area i think
S0253	i know but then that's the horrible thing isn't it if i mean it be like with me with that job the other month
S0254	yeah
S0253	i just couldn't i couldn't understand how i mean like you you know if you go to a job interview and and there's other candidates better than you that's fine but i mean
S0254	yeah to not even be shortlist
S0253	you can be so confident
S0254	mm
S0253	you can be so confident at that at that stage when you're submit an application for something and cos you look at the thing and think well how and look at the spec and think well how could i not get this job
S0254	no
S0253	and then and then when it doesn't happen you sort of you sort of post rationalise things and and and sort of say oh well you know fair enough maybe i could have do this and maybe i could have do that but you'd end up drive yourself insane
S0254	mm yeah
S0253	that's why i think it be on the front of the independent today there be erm there be like some very big grand headline that be britain get back to work
S0253	and it be like employment level at pre
S0254	pre recession highs
S0253	pre recession highs but that's such a mislead
S0254	yeah
S0253	erm you know what do that mean it do it mean the number of people in job in which case you know i can't imagine that
S0254	yeah but by job they can mean a two hour contract or a no hours you know like what be they call no hour contract
S0253	zero hour
S0254	zero hour contract
S0253	zero hour contract
S0254	you know that count as be in employment
S0253	a no nonsense contract
S0254	no nonsense contract
S0253	that's what i want
S0254	i mean that person might have be in a permanent full time job before and now they're on a zero hours contract
S0253	yeah
S0254	but that will still on in figure come out as the same won't it
S0253	mm
S0254	or people i mean really what's happen be people be do more hours for less money aren't they so like like my mum now have to work half eight till five and she get pay less money than she do before
S0253	but that be part of the restructure wasn't it
S0254	mm just be glad you've get a job i mean that's
S0253	me be you talk to me
S0254	no
S0253	thank
S0254	that's the erm that's the thing though isn't it like like they've you know those nhs strike
S0253	yeah oh that be today
S0254	yesterday
S0253	those be yesterday be
S0254	it be yesterday yeah
S0253	how do they go
S0254	erm i saw a few picket line when i be and all outside our work
S0253	be you not expect to partake
S0254	i'm not in a union so
S0253	can you join a union
S0254	i can but i'll have to pay and i can't
S0253	pesky unions
S0254	can't afford to pay
S0253	them and their memberships
S0254	erm but it's like
S0254	it's stupid like so the the they be protest it because nhs staff haven't have a
S0253	a pay rise
S0254	didn't get a one percent pay rise along with the rest of the country erm and haven't have a pay rise for years but they the government just come out yesterday and say oh yeah we can give you the one percent pay rise if you want but we'll have to make job cut so it's like
S0253	what would you prefer
S0254	yeah exactly it's like well this be blackmail really isn't it
S0253	but then that create inflate then doesn't it because you've get people who be you know will feel somewhat indispensable and will be like well i haven't have my pay rise
S0254	yeah
S0253	so
S0254	it's just that put up and shut up attitude isn't it

S0253	no no
S0254	no
S0253	i'm call it
S0254	not like i still think go as like mrs doubtfire or hook would be quite a good one
S0253	i just think it's a bite
S0254	it's not distasteful cos you're not go as like a dead robin williams you're go as a tribute to his like one of his character
S0253	listen here chief
S0254	see you could just say that all night it would be great
S0253	i'd like to go as good will hunt rather than the others
S0253	my hope be chief
S0254	he steal my line
S0253	yeah
S0254	cos it would be distasteful if you weren't you know a
S0253	maybe i maybe i will go as good will hunt robin williams just cos i wanna wear like a tweed blazer and have a beard
S0254	you'd better start grow it now
S0253	do you think many people have see that film
S0254	yeah
S0253	of our friends

S0253	it's dead good isn't it
S0254	yeah
S0253	you've never see dead poets society have you
S0254	erm i've see bits but i don't think i've ever watch it all the way through
S0253	i could take like a cardboard desk and stand on it as robin williams as dead poets
S0254	yeah
S0253	maybe that's what i'll go as cos no one's gonna everyone's gonna go as like hook and
S0254	everyone
S0253	everyone
S0254	i don't think everyone be
S0253	they're gonna exploit
S0254	go as mrs doubtfire
S0253	they'll go bicentennial man
S0253	or the genie from aladdin
S0254	we could get load of blue paint and we could just paint you up put some genie pant on your
S0253	won't be able to sit down
S0254	no that's true don't wanna get blue on all the wall do you
S0253	no
S0254	okay don't go as the genie
S0253	people will think i've go as tobias from arrest development
S0253	yeah yeah okay that's that's a start
S0254	yeah i think that's good cos that's not distasteful cos you're not like it's not a horrible joke you're go as like a nice thing
S0253	a nice thing yeah
S0253	and maybe it i suppose it'll be quite cheap to put together as well go to a charity shop and buy i can always like like like a really raggedy cardigan or like an old tweed blazer
S0254	haven't you get one that you can like rag around a bite
S0253	no my dad never wear that kind of stuff
S0254	you've get you've get a cord blazer i'm sure

S0254	yeah but couldn't you wear it
S0253	no it's get to be dusty and crappy i'll like a better one than that
S0254	oh i imagine that's what that kind of thing will be quite expensive in a charity shop
S0253	no they're not
S0254	no okay
S0253	there's like
S0254	look on the one on bond street
S0253	there's like there's a i mean harris tweed be like i think that i think that be like a good brand of blazer many years ago but there's there's one of them and it's it's in a charity shop it's be there for about a year
S0254	really
S0253	and it's like fifteen quid it's quite big though but it doesn't matter
S0254	it's still a lot of money to spend on a
S0253	that's nothing
S0254	halloween er new year costume

S0253	she erm like i remember read about it and i think she crowd she try to crowd fund it from mm what's the website call be it call crowdfunder or something
S0254	what when you just get random people to like
S0253	what's that
S0254	donate
S0253	what's the website call it's call something like
S0254	justgiving
S0253	no justgiving's like a charity
S0254	yeah but
S0253	no it whatever it be basically i can't remember the website but you you you've get a project right so say you want to start a company make i don't know commemorative i don't know the giants of liverpool commemorative mug
S0253	so you say to people i need one thousand pound to buy ceramics and to buy a kiln and to get my business off the grind upon do so i can give you this back so they kind of people offer different things back some will offer like a free a free copy of the product or a free thing from the product
S0254	mm
S0253	and if people invest like a minimum investment of like a fiver erm or some of the project be much bigger some of them be like fully fledge businesses and they're look for millions of pound
S0254	mm
S0253	erm so it's about
S0254	oh
S0253	really and the idea be that
S0254	yeah i suppose it be isn't it
S0253	so it's call crowd pull the idea be that like people some people just like the idea of something so they yeah i'll give a fiver for that hope hopefully it'll come good
S0254	mm
S0253	erm and then i don't think i think they have a target they can't spend your money before the thing's do there's like obligations so they you can't just like say oh thank for the forty quid i only need to you know buy a birthday present like
S0254	yeah
S0253	there's probably there's there be there be like er they've very
S0254	regulations
S0253	it i don't even think it's regulations i just think it's a very good system i think
S0254	oh
S0253	it's very difficult to screw people over on it or something like that
S0254	yeah
S0253	or people very stupid with it
S0254	that's
S0253	erm so yeah it could so it could be like video game and things like that and people oh be that scary
S0254	it's a game boy game isn't it or something
S0253	it's a game boy game
S0254	so not real game boy footage
S0253	no they say not real game footage
S0254	oh
S0253	this look
S0254	oh wonderfully vile and excite all at the same
S0253	i think
S0254	time
S0253	be that a game oh my
S0254	i know
S0253	god
S0254	oh but that's
S0253	erm
S0254	why do people wanna play these things
S0253	to
S0254	i don't understand
S0253	to expel demons in them
S0254	well you know the next thing will be like a violent rape and murder and it'll be a game and you can like rape and murder somebody and that'll be alright
S0253	have you have you play grand theft auto before no there's none er there's not there's no rape in grand theft auto
S0254	but i just think like when be it gonna stop like what cos that's almost like play isn't it
S0253	it be actually
S0254	like how awful
S0253	yeah but the idea be that be that you're survive the evil you're not carry out the evil
S0254	mm okay
S0253	i mean there be call of duty where you have to torture someone and that's pretty
S0254	yeah
S0253	pretty brutal
S0254	i always use to find myself like judge parent when they'd come in with like their seven year old boy and be like buy them call of duty and just think do you know what it's about like
S0253	but call of
S0254	don't let your
S0253	call of duty be but call
S0254	seven year old play call of duty
S0253	it just reflect the kind of the time we're in like
S0254	mm
S0253	call of duty originally i think i i kind of remember play like one of the first or second ones and yeah it be violent it be you know but it be no different to any other game at the time
S0254	yeah
S0253	and then it just take on this whole other level eventually where it be like very i think as as the visuals improve
S0254	yeah
S0253	it just
S0254	it look real i think
S0253	yeah it just
S0254	that's the thing now isn't it they look more real
S0253	and i guess the i mean i remember very very crude game
S0254	it's scary
S0253	on on the ps one and and before that and they be really violent
S0254	mm
S0253	but the blood be like big circle that come on it
S0254	yeah
S0253	and it it didn't look real so it be kind of okay it be palatable
S0254	yeah
S0253	i remember like grand theft auto originally be a top down bird's eye view and okay you run over little little like you know stick people almost
S0254	yeah
S0253	and blood would squirt across the road
S0253	but it look so cartoony and silly
S0254	yeah
S0253	that like you know a parent might be worry about what be happen but there be no the problem be i think the thing be be that kid be never gonna go this be like real life because
S0254	mm
S0253	in real life you don't see things from a
S0254	and i don't even mean it from like er oh those children be gonna go out and kill people but it's just like that's awful that's horrible graphics to show to a child like you wouldn't let them watch a film that have like murder and violence and
S0253	but it's er more immersive that's that's the problem isn't it like
S0254	yeah
S0253	computer game be more immersive than film in film it's easier to kind of sit and say i'm i'm this be a a product whereas when we're do the
S0254	i know but those those visuals be still have an
S0253	but er
S0254	effect on you aren't they
S0253	but i think when you're do it when you're engage with it more that's worse because like you kind of
S0254	well it be worse really
S0253	the boundaries kind of between
S0254	yeah
S0253	yeah
S0254	they blur
S0253	and so on but i mean i don't know what be my original point
S0254	dunno i don't know i think i interrupt you
S0253	it be melissa joan hart but erm
S0254	from melissa joan hart to violent video game
S0253	but just what you're say about that game there i mean that be that be design to
S0254	it's horrible
S0253	you know to shock and to kind of you know
S0254	yeah
S0253	to scare people and things like that but it i mean it
S0254	oh that look like a nice pie
S0253	but these these things aren't mindless though these game i mean like 's play one at the moment call the last of us i mean we play that through like for forty five minutes and there wasn't a single like you're kill zombies essentially
S0254	mm
S0253	erm but there wasn't a single like it be just use your noodle and it be like a lot of story and a lot of
S0254	mm
S0253	background and stuff erm yeah so anyway she erm i'm i read about this it i think it's this show she put it on what's that website call whatever that website's call
S0254	yeah
S0253	and and people be like ha ha no way melissa joan hart's try to get money to to start a tv show either way i think a company pick it up in the end or maybe she do get enough money to start it
S0254	yeah
S0253	erm and it's call melissa and joey and it's just about her live with a guy that
S0254	mm
S0253	she's not with but well they be and they
S0254	mm
S0253	couldn't carry on
S0254	with hilarious consequences
S0253	but it's it's really bad
S0254	oh that's a shame
S0253	well no it's not i mean bear in mind this be in in twenty it's like it's like
S0254	yeah like fifteen years ago
S0253	fifteen years ago people change
S0254	she wasn't really that great in it it's just that sabrina the teenage witch be like my favouritest programme of all time ever
S0253	it well i
S0254	i still secretly hope that one day
S0253	be that
S0254	i'll wake up and be a witch
S0253	i be watch this and i be i be think how rusty like the the the act be in it and obviously it's a low budget comedy like it's you know it's nothing to go run past a series or two but what amaze me be that i be think about like her act wasn't very good in it and neither be the it well most people's act wasn't good in it
S0253	but i be think like how those character like clarissa and and sabrina you know she they be like her weren't they they be synonymous with her
S0254	mm
S0253	so and i guess when you're a kid you don't really you're not very discern about see this be funny
S0254	no i hate this as well
S0253	i just don't think you like this kind of tv
S0254	no
S0253	the
S0254	she annoy me cos she's just like oh i'm a ditsy doctor she just bother me
S0253	but
S0254	it's like i don't like ugly betty either
S0253	that's
S0254	and like
S0253	that's
S0254	that and i group that in
S0253	that's finish
S0254	in the same
S0253	category
S0254	yeah
S0253	well i suppose if you look at this and new girl like it's the whole point of these things it's it's about the comedy of it be be like you know these these women sort of bear all so it's like i'm
S0254	i know
S0253	i'm just a mess i'm just a
S0254	i know
S0253	i can't hold my career together
S0254	yeah
S0253	all the pressure of be a
S0254	i think that's what
S0253	modern woman
S0254	bother me be like oh i'm such a hapless woman try make it in a man's world and i just think oh
S0253	but at the same time the whole er the kind of the success of these program be that you know it's like it's like you know look at i dunno new girl and it's like she's ridiculously beautiful and can't keep a can't keep her shit together
S0254	mm
S0253	that's the kind of i dunno that's the appeal of it i guess
S0254	yeah yeah i dunno i just don't
S0253	that's why girls be a bite of a better programme isn't it cos the the at least the
S0254	yeah they're kind of
S0253	the
S0254	more i dunno
S0253	together
S0254	normal no they're not together at all
S0253	the yeah but er they're not ditsy be they
S0254	no i dunno i don't i like that a bite better it's a bite more
S0253	relatable
S0254	yeah i just don't like this there's never seem to be any story to it really or it's just like a series of hapless events
S0253	what girls
S0254	no these sort of program
S0253	well they have to be self contain don't they
S0254	yeah whereas girls wasn't that be er over a series and that
S0253	yeah
S0254	it's cleverly it wasn't cleverly write it be well write
S0253	it's come back isn't it it's gonna keep go for a bite
S0254	yeah i mean i haven't see any of the last series it wasn't as glossy like this and new girl be so like bright colour and and like glossy magazine
S0253	but i but i think that's why i like it for me it's the equivalent of leave a a radio on for a dog when you go out
S0253	i just have this on and i don't i don't
S0254	you like the bright colour and the
S0253	i i just
S0254	the stimulus

S0253	sporadically
S0253	and have and have like
S0253	sort of very accessible humour just come out of it like
S0254	yeah
S0253	but if you're here then who's in there oh no that's why i need it just to say

S0253	mm
S0254	in your head you've like flash through the whole episode and remember all the joke laugh at all the joke and then you watch the rest of the episode and laugh at them as they come up
S0253	yeah it's almost not necessary to watch
