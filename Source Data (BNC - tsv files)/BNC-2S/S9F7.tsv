S0526	i've be a model nothing to do with cataracts i've be a model engineer for nearly thirty years erm i've build three traction engines i'm now do a railway engine build a number of stationary engines workshops be build up over the years several lathes different type different mill machine be a member of the club for model engineer for nearly thirty years and i'm here on a work party do not a lot
S0486	so the background noise we can hear be other people work this morning erm can you tell me er all the things you've do over the years what would you say erm be your biggest achievement
S0526	probably the last traction engine mclaren compound
S0486	right and erm be that can you tell me the erm where that originate from the mclaren compound
S0526	it be order by the war office for service in the first world war but it never saw service but it wasn't complete until nineteen nineteen so it be surplus to requirements by that time
S0486	right
S0526	it go for road haulage but the road hauliers didn't like it they say it be too big convert to a showman's engine the showman didn't like it because they say it be too big and subsequently the wheel be cut back to make it better for british roads the steer be move from one side to the other for the same reason and it go back into service as a road locomotive heavy haulage
S0486	oh right they be very dramatic i frequently see you at show drive erm your steam engines erm what be you work on at the moment
S0526	erm my first railway engine which be a
S0486	oh right
S0526	a narrow gauge engine at er seven and a quarter inch gauge but because it's a narrow gauge it work out at er almost third full size
S0486	oh right i see and how far down down the line be you work on that
S0526	i've i've a i have a roll chassis i've be on it a year next month
S0486	oh gosh so how much time do you put in every day
S0526	about three hours a day
S0486	really
S0526	yeah
S0486	that's real dedication
S0526	mm
S0486	one of the things that's always appeal to me about the model engineer be the people who do it be real engineer they're not train spotters they're not
S0526	oh no i'm not not really
S0486	they're they're not train set people
S0526	no i'm
S0526	not really into railways railways have always leave me cold erm from the age of nine
S0486	oh right
S0526	to twenty one we live in a cottage with a very long garden at the bottom of which be the mainline railway track
S0486	oh right
S0526	and i wasn't a bite interest in the train
S0486	oh right
S0526	back in the er the days of steam you'd be
S0486	yes
S0526	er specially in the summer if you have the door open
S0486	yes
S0526	and you hear a train come and look out you could see the glow from the firebox as it go past
S0486	yes yeah yes
S0526	but erm my biggest erm think of railways at that time be that they interrupt whatever i be listen to whether it be the television or what
S0526	you couldn't hear a thing as they trundle past
S0486	yeah well your your erm engines here be a lot less noisy than that aren't they
S0526	well of course they're a lot smaller yes
S0486	yeah and this have be a wonderful project on this field here er
S0526	it have it's have its up and down
S0486	yeah
S0526	it's not perfect but then whatever be
S0486	yeah i remember when they first say because i use to live in erm er before i meet twenty years ago
S0526	yeah
S0486	and erm when i live here it be around the time that somebody bulldoze the pavilion do you remember that
S0526	er no i don't actually remember it but i the story have be tell to me on numerous occasion yeah
S0486	numerous occasion and i remember
S0526	they they steal a digger and demolish the pavilion yeah yeah
S0486	yes that's right that's absolutely right
S0526	yeah yeah
S0486	well i i remember read it in the gazette and i say when you say you when they all say they be come here from i think my goodness oh dear i don't hold up much hope so i be quite pessimistic about it
S0486	erm because there have be a i mean there be one lady i don't know whether you know this in who give a talk at hall she come from london to talk to a group and the group outside there be erm a group of boys and they bang on the windows and pound on the doors and she be so terrify she say she would rather give a talk in london than she would in
S0526	really
S0486	and that yeah that there be such you know the erm hall where
S0526	yeah
S0486	where they've get a similar sort of layout haven't they with children's swing and
S0526	no when i be a teenager
S0486	mm
S0526	there be a i won't call em a motorcycle gang but there be a number of lads with motorcycle that come from
S0486	right right
S0526	and er i get quite friendly with them and they weren't that bad
S0486	no no
S0526	least i didn't think so at the time
S0486	these no these be youngsters
S0526	i probably would now
S0486	these be you know school age children
S0526	oh right yeah yeah
S0486	they be school age children i be quite the reason i be say that to you be i be book for the next speaker to speak there and i do a talk on erm er women's periodicals in the victorian
S0526	right
S0486	in victorian england which i have find a collection of in a junk shop
S0526	right
S0486	and i talk about it and i've get still get them and they're wonderful and erm they say to me oh we hope it's not like last time and then they tell me about it so that's how i know
S0526	yeah right
S0486	of it really erm anyway erm so er the the erm project here have go from strength to strength recently
S0526	yes er well we've get about half a mile of track we've get point we've get side the first lot be fabricate off site at the engineer workshop of er of one of our members who be kind enough to let us use his equipment
S0486	right
S0526	include his welder and his machine for for make point the rest be be build on the grind here on site
S0486	right then you've get a turntable er
S0526	we have a turntable
S0486	yeah
S0526	yeah we've
S0486	er
S0526	we've get a return loop unfortunately we haven't a continuous run from the station so the train go out go round a loop back through the woods and then back onto the turntable where they're turn and run around a train we have get a continuous loop down the bottom but that doesn't help passengers on and off the station
S0486	right right
S0526	so i've just see somebody else turn up possibly with an engine
S0486	oh right
S0526	they do say they want to get the bug out of this engine
S0486	oh do they oh right
S0526	yeah
S0486	so let's have let's see how far we've we how well we've get on at the moment erm well we're on six nearly seven minutes so we've get another ten to take
S0526	right there might there might be a trace of in my voice because my parent come from
S0486	oh right oh do they so what what age be you when you leave or you
S0526	i wasn't i be bear here
S0486	you be bear here
S0526	mm

S0486	yeah
S0526	i remember when we first move to
S0486	right
S0526	which by then i mean it's part of the town virtually now
S0486	yes
S0526	but when we go there i be nine that would've be nineteen fifty six
S0486	right
S0526	erm it be really in the depths of the country
S0486	right
S0526	and er my mother have they didn't get marry till after the war and i come along quite quickly afterwards so she wasn't conversant with the accent

S0526	production control erm plan
S0486	right right
S0526	and finally er graphics
S0486	right
S0526	and hence the apple mac
S0486	oh yes yes well you do some very good leaflets for the model engineer i've see them and they do take a lot of time
S0526	know what my wife say when i show her the first one
S0486	what do she say
S0526	she say cor that look good that's almost professional
S0526	i say what the hell do you think i've be do for the last forty nine years

S0526	mm
S0486	get about four more minutes to do
S0486	someone's approach with er talk
S0526	yeah talk he's he's be a good candidate he would
S0526	he's he's a he reckon he's a poor builder

S0526	no
S0486	erm have you be on any good trip with the model engineer recently then
S0526	yes erm we go to coal mine in in wales
S0486	oh yes mm mm
S0526	go to steam railway have a footplate ride i've be to pump station and of course every year i go to
S0486	right
S0526	courtesy of one of our members and we stay with his son make a weekend of it
S0486	we love we absolutely love
S0526	i've never be into the town
