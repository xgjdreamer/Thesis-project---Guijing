S0033	yeah but um it's alright
S0018	it's ah what what be you do in france then
S0033	i be coach tennis
S0018	okay
S0033	at one of the biggest academies in the world
S0018	uh huh
S0033	it's like one of the top five in the world and i love it over there but it's expensive and and the job wasn't the greatest
S0018	right
S0033	so at the end of the day all my friends leave because the job wasn't the greatest and then i kinda be like i love it here but i'm not gonna stay here any longer it's everything kinda go sour
S0018	oh what a shame whereabouts be that in france
S0033	um just next to nice a little town call sophia antipolis
S0018	ah
S0033	it's like a big business complex and university type place
S0018	ah yeah one of those yeah like kind of it's get all the industrial park and all the big businesses
S0033	yeah and just hotels and businesses and school and colleges
S0018	aha
S0033	it's just a massive town like that but it be only about twenty twenty five minutes away from nice and twenty minutes from cannes and
S0018	aha
S0033	just a bite further inland but it be brilliant out there and i adore it absolutely adore it
S0018	be they be all your clients like the ceos of all these big
S0033	yeah
S0018	japanese company and stuff
S0033	you'd like to think they're the ceos whether or not their parent be do a bite more dodgy business you have no idea
S0018	yeah yeah i know that's the kinda idea i get from all those little well big complexes like that in france
S0033	well the thing be who's get
S0018	because they just seem really sterile and everybody seem like they be behave themselves too much so what's go on under the surface
S0033	but the thing be be who who can afford thirty grand just to send their kid to play tennis for a year they do their school and they play tennis but it's thirty grand and then they get to play extras for tournaments and whatever else the kid be do but they're all russian and serbian and
S0018	mhm
S0033	all sort everyone from every country really
S0018	and what they send their kid to that tennis school for a year or be the parent live there as well
S0033	no they just send them there like one a one the reason like i didn't like my job so much be because of what it entail be i be a tennis coach coach like six to eight hours a day
S0018	mhm
S0033	i live in the dormitories with the kid and have to look after them until they go to sleep i be a taxi driver there and back from the airport every single time they um need a taxi driver to any of the tournaments they need to go to
S0018	mhm
S0033	i i work seven days a week
S0018	yeah
S0033	which be nonstop ten twelve hours a day
S0018	like a surrogate parent cum coach
S0033	yeah you know it be just you know i i don't think i have a day off in two years
S0018	really
S0033	and the summer's intense over there because the amount of kid that they get to go over
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0033	it's um two months of just you know you're look after between eighty and a hundred and twenty kid a week
S0033	you've get maybe maybe eight staff
S0018	mhm
S0033	at the place
S0018	frighten it's crazy isn't it
S0033	just get hundreds and hundreds of kid just pass in and out and you get eight hour day in thirty six degree heat
S0018	blimey
S0033	and then you get to get back and look after them then look after them on the weekend as well
S0018	and when do you get days off or time off
S0033	you don't you don't
S0018	be that not against the law
S0033	well not for the way that they hire me no
S0018	really what be it just ah
S0033	yeah
S0018	hey would you like some pay work yes alright good be that a nod yes ok that's a contract there
S0033	they they they kinda dodgy in those place as well to be honest with you
S0018	mm
S0033	but erm
S0018	be it like a chain of tennis court or
S0033	no if anything they've only just branch out they've branch out to paris now as well
S0018	oh yeah
S0033	so they get um they're start to get a bite bigger and stuff but it's only because where they be at the moment it's so expensive that they can't really run what they're do down there cos they run it from a mercure hotel at the back of this hotel they've get like sixteen court at the back of it it's so beautiful it's just ridiculous proper red clay court with everything um they have to hire that they have to hire a build at the university so everyone can stay there and also use the golf course cos it's also a joint golf academy as well
S0018	mm be that where you be live at the university nice nice in nice
S0033	no it be beautiful i mean i love it but just due to the fact that i be like nineteen twenty and i enjoy go out and do stuff that when you work for ten hours go out on a night and then try and wake up at six be the next morning and do it for the rest of the week especially when you go out two or three nights a week i mean at one point i have a band out there and we be do three or four gigs a week so we'd be out till two be and then up at six be
S0018	mm yep yeah yeah yeah gosh yeah you can only do that when you're nineteen
S0033	i remember i remember the one summer i go back home i have two two weeks holiday back at home after the summer and i go home and i honest to god sleep for two weeks just didn't wake up cos i'd be live off three hours sleep for two months
S0018	mm nightmare you can't really function properly off that especially when you're look after kid cos kid just suck so much energy out of you don't they they
S0033	and then just
S0018	take your eye off them
S0033	you you with all kinds of work there always end up be the one kind of person who seem very incompetent at the job and you keep have to cover for them and i hat that over there so much cos i be work so hard over there there be one guy who be mean to be run like what we be do and he be just never there but the problem be he be best friends with the boss
S0018	aha difficult situation
S0033	so i must have almost get him sack about three time and the boss save his bacon every time
S0018	oh no
S0033	so he didn't like me very much
S0018	and do you speak french then
S0033	um i've get better at it yeah i mean the problem when i first get there be everyone want to learn english
S0018	yes i've hear that too
S0033	i be in an international academy and i be one of the only coach who know english the rest of them be very bad disjoint english so i kinda teach everybody english and for the first six months or something didn't learn any of it myself
S0018	aha aha yeah be you actually be it be any of your students french or be they mostly international
S0033	some of them where the funniest part about it actually be most of my kid be like like serbia russian something like that so they know english as well as well it be one of the things some of them be french and want to learn english but i remember they lob me with a job erm coach the local school kid
S0018	mhm
S0033	so i have a bunch of six year olds who only speak french so there you go okay i don't know what i'm go to be do here
S0033	and they do that when i first get there so that be a difficult summer but it help me out i mean have to learn the language that way be
S0018	yeah good motivator
S0033	yeah otherwise you've get a bunch of six year old kid just star at you go i have no idea what you're talk about mate
S0018	i do that i be erm i have a class the for for one of the first class i have for when i move to spain and hadn't learn spanish before i go and learn it there while i be live there and yeah i have a group of eh six and seven year olds i be in an english class but yeah once they realise that i didn't speak any spanish they really try it on and then they realise that i be go to give it to them in english regardless of the fact that i didn't speak any spanish they be go to get it from me if they behave badly in an in a language that they didn't understand but uh
S0033	yeah mm yeah
S0018	you can express annoyance in international language
S0033	but the thing be body language body language be beautiful cos it work in any language
S0018	yep it's true it's true
S0033	but erm yeah no i mean just i fell into tennis just because and i've be do it ever since i i mean i start late i start late for what any any coach anybody in this country will tell you i start at thirteen and they all tell me i'd never make it anywhere
S0018	be that eh be that something your parent suggest you should do or be it something you want to do
S0033	no it be it be quite strange i be a i be a cricket player when i be younger
S0018	yeah
S0033	but i get a strange injury to my leg and like kinda big mental block play cricket so my dad suggest that i move to tennis i want to play football
S0018	mhm
S0033	but we're ozzies so he didn't really like football
S0033	so he kinda shepherd me round that and get me into tennis and you know i i i play from i be thirteen until i be fifteen just a couple of time a week and stuff we end up go er travel quite far distance to go to squads and learn from some of the coach and then when i be like fifteen i i quit school and i do like distance education
S0018	oh yeah
S0033	learn from home cos i do that in australia anyway
S0018	oh right
S0033	and erm i i do that from home so i train eight hours a day get home and do my school work it just make it so much more simple because you can't get court at night time you can't train at the time you want to after school and you're always tire after school
S0018	yep mm so who school you be it um your parent or you have a
S0033	myself
S0018	oh right
S0033	it be distance education from australia again because umm when i be live in australia i live on a bus like a tour bus and ah my mum use to teach me but they they do they do it quite well from australia the the book and stuff be well write
S0018	uh uh so what be what be you live over there for
S0033	in australia
S0018	yep
S0033	because of my parent be australian my whole family be australian
S0018	oh right
S0033	and i live there till i be ten

S0033	i've get dual citizenship
S0018	right
S0033	both passports
S0018	but you'd say you're a british you're a british national as much as an australian national or
S0033	i don't know i don't know i don't know if i've ever really felt at home in either place to be honest with you
S0018	mm yeah when you live between two place it's always
S0033	it's difficult because i grow up as an ozzie i do i do feel australian but i've live a lot of my time here as well i live a bite of time in france and i'd like to think i'm a bite french
S0018	ooh la la so how how come you end up move back to britain
S0033	um my parent still live here
S0018	ah
S0033	and when i when i quit my job in france i be i just need to some stability again
S0018	mm but why do they move over
S0033	why do they move over
S0018	yep
S0033	we move over here in 2000 cos of my dad's job because of comedy

S0018	so he go he go down the move countries route and we move over here a few years go past and and we buy a pub up in in
S0033	mm mm
S0018	and that go really well and then we move to

S0033	because there be a tennis centre there
S0018	ah okay
S0033	there be a tennis centre there and we be travel from to there every single day and we figure hey we're live in a village we think hey if we're live in a kind of town kind of area it can't do badly we'll just take the model that we've get here and put it in that pub down there die an absolute death oh my god it die
S0018	really what's like
S0033	dirty
S0018	really
S0033	it's just it's not a great place but uh it's get better slowly but i mean things have be go better since my mum's like the pub's not really even a pub anymore
S0018	what be it
S0033	it's like a bead shop brassiere type thing
S0033	it's still get the beer and everything in it but because of my mum's bead and pearl she need wall to wall in that now
S0018	aha oh wow
S0033	all the women who come there love it and the guy don't mind get drag along because they can have a pint
S0018	that sound like a win solution
S0033	so it's ah it's a good little good little one that one
S0018	do your mum actually make up the necklaces and bracelets as well or
S0033	no we sell them wholesale
S0018	ah okay
S0033	we sell erm wholesale and people who either have small businesses or run shop of their own where they sell the make up stuff buy off us so but i mean she do fair all over the country she's up in scotland and god know where sell the stuff all the time

S0033	well it's not fun but it's something my a lot of my family's into
S0018	yeah
S0033	my uncle in australia and my cousin in america she have twenty six store at one point in america

S0033	sydney bore me it's like any other city in the entire world and
S0018	really
S0033	just doesn't just doesn't do it for me that's why i like nice it be strange it be a very different place it wasn't like a city it be old it be very old and they keep it that way
S0018	mm yep yep nice be lovely
S0033	it wasn't like they'd try to build new build and try to cram up the place it be just
S0018	true but i guess it's get more history hasn't it
S0033	yeah
S0018	it's cos the old quarter in nice date from quite a long time ago doesn't it
S0033	yeah i use to spend most of my time down there and i love cannes as well
S0018	mm
S0033	the promenade down there be beautiful
S0018	mm
S0033	ah but no i'd with me i'd never know never know where i'm head me
S0033	i'm twenty one
S0018	be you
S0033	yeah i've a lot of life ahead of me i hope
S0018	and what be your plan do you think
S0033	no i have no i never have plan
S0018	no
S0033	no but the one plan i have in my head be that i would like to buy a place in south france one day and like retire there
S0018	oh sound like a good plan
S0033	but i would need so much money to do that i'm go to have to work very hard
S0018	i think you might you might have to coach tennis in your retirement
S0033	win the lottery no but like i mean still get the contact over there i mean they're mean to be start up a new club med have you ever hear of club med
S0018	uh uh
S0033	they're mean to be start up a new club med tennis academy there
S0018	oh right
S0033	in 2013 or something and
S0018	isn't club med the kind of kind of a holiday you go on if you want to get drink all the time
S0033	no i don't know if no it's it it depend i think there might be some of those ones but the the one of my friends be work in um sandpiper bay in florida at the moment and erm it's it's a real tennis academy
S0018	mm
S0033	it's intense but at a place which be like a five star hotel with um five star golf course and everything just it's amaze and i have friends out there coach in france who be go to people's house and coach and take a hundred euros an hour
S0018	mm yes wouldn't surprise me
S0033	if you can live your life like that you'd be alright
S0018	yes definitely if you can get the contact of the people who can pay that much money
S0033	well you get to think realistically me be able to speak english it's all the ex pat communities you want to be go to
S0018	mm
S0033	erm the people who who've move over there in and have the money to spend on stuff like that
S0018	yep then again i don't know what the ex pat community be like nowadays i know it's in spain it's wither considerably after the
S0033	it's all in china these days
S0018	really
S0033	oh all over there it's um it's a different place over there
S0018	mm
S0033	i go over there for like a week
S0018	mhm
S0033	that be strange
S0018	work or holiday
S0033	kind of yeah with my parent
S0018	oh to find the bead
S0033	yeah
S0033	but that be like six years ago be the last time i go to australia haven't see any of my family in six years
S0018	uh uh oh
S0033	don't get the chance it's uh too expensive the flight over there and
S0018	it be yeah my brother my brother always say oh be you come to visit me and i'm like erm
S0033	i don't know it's not just that it's
S0018	have i get a spare couple of thousand in a month no
S0033	it's not just it's not just that you know it's also the the fact that if you go to australia with the jet lag and all that lot you don't want to be go there for a week or two weeks you want to be go for a month
S0018	definitely
S0033	or six weeks or something and then to get that time off work be almost impossible these days
S0018	yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah no the last time i go be i think it be two weeks and i spend the first week just feel absolutely exhaust cause of the flight
S0033	it just knock you out cos it's it's like ten hours in front you know be it ten hours in front it's almost the opposite of the clock you've gotta change your entire body clock
S0018	yeah but even the just thirty hours in transit i e in you know travel and
S0033	i'm alright with that cos i just sleep as soon as the plane turn its engine on go
S0018	oh no no i be uh on i be travel alone so i be have to sit next to other people who be travel alone and i be sit next to this huge fat smelly guy so for want of a better word he smelt
S0033	yeah
S0018	and uh he eat really loudly and he kinda just take up so much place i be couldn't really relax on the way over
S0033	i sit i solve all those problems i always get the window seat and i take an ipod with me stick the earphones goodnight to the world
S0018	you can
S0033	i normally put a jacket over my face or something so nobody can touch me
S0018	well a friend recommend that i take a piece of string and just sit there with a piece of string hang out of one half and just sit there look like i'm crazy and then no one would want to sit next to me
S0033	and the the the especially like the short transit flight be it's a joke i fall asleep when the engine turn on and i wake up when the plane hit the tarmac
S0033	it doesn't matter if it's a two hour flight like i'll get on and go fall asleep and then boom oh well look i'm here quality
S0018	you're lucky very lucky hmm
S0033	i remember the amount of flight i've catch from here and france and back no luggage whatsoever just walk on with a tennis racket
S0033	be a tennis coach just walk on with a tennis racket sit down go to sleep wake back up get off the plane and go to work
S0018	that's a good commute so i guess you didn't get to come over and visit your family much when you be live in france do you
S0033	i don't know whether it be a good thing or not
S0018	they go over to you yeah do they go over to you at all
S0033	yeah yeah they come and visit me quite a lot i mean it be a good little trip for them you know little few cheap hotels in the area and they could just come and stay with me for a bite and
S0018	i might be go to nice at some point in the future i've get a a friend well i be friends with a family a russian family when i be live in barcelona i be teach them english
S0033	yeah
S0018	and erm they be from uzbekistan and they'd move away from russia because they didn't he have a build construction industry uh company and he didn't want to be involve in all the corruption and scamming and that be go on what
S0033	with the mafia
S0018	erm they move to barcelona to france erm aix en provence
S0033	mm
S0018	and erm three years later he find his wife have be blow up in their car and she obviously die erm and then the next day he be put in prison for it when there be no evidence whatsoever that he'd do it he'd he'd get a witness say that he be somewhere else and he's be battle this for the past seven years
S0033	be that french police or
S0018	french police yeah they obviously just didn't you know they probably sniff that it might be a mafia type crime and they just didn't want to touch it and
S0033	the french police be be quite strange the way they go about things because they're very lay back about everything you don't see police cars drive up and down the road you don't see people patrol you won't see them walk through the streets the one thing i have see i think i be in lyon at the time and you don't see anybody and then this guy's walk down the street i saw a swat van pull up about twenty guy jump out of it and just bang grab this guy throw him in the back of the van and see you later and i'm like wow
S0018	yeah yeah definitely
S0033	it's either nothing or everything
S0018	yeah yeah yeah they be hard full on tactics to when i be um i use to work in disneyland in paris when i be at uni and uh one summer the americans who work there and live in the same residence as me decide they want to have a a fourth of july party and so it be crazy i mean it be like a university residence and there be a rock band on one of the balconies and they be chuck fireworks into the crowd below and there be a lot of people around drink and just have fun and exactly what the french people have be gonna do for their july the fourteenth holiday but somebody phone the police and nobody come but about an hour later the crs you know the riot squad they arrive and they just put themselves in position with their full riot gear and like everybody be just like oh what's go on carry on drink and they just stay there they didn't do anything they be just wait for something to happen
S0033	yeah to happen
S0018	and one of the drunken american guy decide it would be a good idea to pull a moonie at them and so he just go stand in front of them pull his trousers down in front of them and they just absolutely leap at him they they get the dog on him the tear gas be go and from that that tiny action of
S0033	no they're just wait for something give them an excuse and they'll go for it
S0018	yeah but they be brutal absolutely brutal it be crazy then again it be a stupid thing to do to go and moon the french crs
S0033	you can't help people when they start to drink
S0018	but i guess in the place that you be the the anatalie what be it sophia anatalie
S0033	sophia antipolis
S0018	that's it um i guess there be like private security police and

S0018	uh uh
S0033	he's have to change it a lot because a lot of it apply to australia
S0018	uh uh
S0033	i think i think he might refer to himself as an anarchist maybe a bite like that i don't know but
S0033	um comedy's change over the last decade it's stand up comedy be just sketch these days it's all storytelling and personal experience and stuff that you can relate to much like music be these days as well it's not so much one liners and pub joke any more
S0018	have he be have he be able to adapt to that easily
S0033	yeah i mean he be do it all along anyway really he's he's be through a few change in his sort of comedy over the time he's be do it but i mean he's be do it what forty years now or something he know the the scene inside out
S0018	mhm
S0033	but he hat it these days he only do it for the money
S0018	aww do he do it with musical accompaniment too

S0018	aha
S0033	he use to headline the equivalent in australia he be huge
S0018	mhm oh brilliant
S0033	seriously we we spend we'd spend the whole year on tour cos you but he'd be book out the whole year we'd just travel from place to place to place for all these gigs and he'd do it with a guy some guy would play guitar and sing so it be kinda uh a cabaret i suppose type show but
S0018	and when he get home from work be he really serious or do he continue crack joke all the time
S0033	ah he doesn't crack joke but he's not really serious he's just a he's a business man dad be what everything's always about where to go from here
S0018	mhm
S0033	just unfortunately he's not a very good investor he ah spend the money when he have it he like to live
S0018	ah oh well live for the moment it's not a bad philosophy
S0033	it's not a bad philosophy but i mean he's be a millionaire twice in his life the unfortunate part be he's be break three time

S0018	aww you miss that
S0033	i miss that part
S0018	shame
S0033	i mean when i be younger we be quite well off when i be younger we be quite well off but one of the reason we move to england be we lose everything over there
S0018	really
S0033	yeah that's why we need a change
S0018	mm why be that be there some kind of financial crisis
S0033	nah agent
S0018	ah
S0033	can't trust them
S0018	as far as you can throw them and have he be do it himself then over here have he be promote himself
S0033	yeah he's he's get a couple of agents over here but he just he doesn't do it that big and he doesn't want to go that big anymore he just he just sort of mill along these days
S0018	hmm
S0033	but i mean both my parent just don't know how to relax work
S0018	really oh what a shame you would have think that they'd have get that down to pat by now
S0033	yeah like seven seven days a week just as much as they can work
S0018	then again mr who say he work six days a week and then uh doesn't know how to relax on his day off
S0033	i think uh i think i get that from my parent to be honest with you
S0033	wish i'd parent who know how to relax a little bite i mean i get home and end up clean the entire house clean the car clean everything and just uh it's still only like twelve and i'm go what can i do now
S0018	aww hmm yes i guess when you're a tennis coach the last thing you want to do on your day off be go and play tennis
S0033	yeah the worst thing with me be like since i quit tennis and um when i quit tennis i still stay in the gym quite a bite and uh but then for some reason i just stop completely and uh since then i don't i mean i work for david lloyd and i've be in the gym twice in two years i mean that's bad that's bad i've use the pool maybe three time i've use the gym twice and i work in this place six days a week
S0018	mm oh but you get you get free access don't you
S0033	yep i just don't touch any of it i've never be to a class here i've never do anything here because the thing be i mean i run around the court all day
S0018	no oh yeah
S0033	i run around the court all day and the last thing i want to do at the end of the day be go and run some more to be honest with you
S0018	true
S0033	but the things be i'm not as fit as i use to be so
S0018	hmm
S0033	get's me down a little bite but then again i'm just too lazy to get myself in the gym
S0018	get one of the personal trainers on your case
S0033	might try and trade off for tennis lessons
S0033	i'll teach you how to play tennis if you get me fit again
S0018	well they'll probably just say just carry the kettle bell around the court when you're train so what time do you arrive this morning then if you're leave so late tonight
S0033	uh start at quarter to nine this morning
S0018	in the morning
S0033	and i finish at ten
S0018	oh my life
S0033	then it take me an hour to get home so i'll be back at eleven
S0018	god and uh but have you get do you have like a lesson early this morning or something
S0033	i have a lesson at quarter to nine and then uh a lesson at ten and then nothing till two then this and then i'm on court three till ten now
S0018	blimey
S0033	and that's a solid seven hours on court
S0018	that be solid isn't it do you be there anywhere you can take a nap round here
S0033	not really i've get my car out back
S0018	aww
S0033	it serve alright sometimes i use to have a big vauxhall vivaro van and i honest to god have a double bed mattress in the back of it
S0018	aha
S0033	so when i be drive that around i use to just whenever i have a couple of hours off i'd jump in the back of that fall asleep and wake up again and go back to work
S0018	it's a good idea but why don't you i mean what do you do with your time off if you've get if you have nothing for what three four hours
S0033	nothing
S0018	and don't you like go in the spa or go for a swim
S0033	no it's too much effort
S0033	i just go and sit down somewhere
S0018	you go and sit down somewhere
S0033	i go and sit down somewhere and do some work do something
S0018	and do they fee you here
S0033	no
S0018	you have to bring your own stuff do you get a discount
S0033	uh very minimal
S0018	yeah
S0033	fifteen per cent or something
S0018	that's a shame
S0033	with these price it's not even worth it
S0018	yeah true mm aw you should take advantage of your time and the free time you have and the cos they've get some fantastic um installations haven't they like swim pool and
S0033	hey if it be sunny outside i would've be outside sunbathe that's what i would have be do
S0018	mm well

S0018	what a shame eh last week it be gorgeous i get sunburn sit out there for forty five minutes and uh when do they open the swim pool
S0033	yeah it's mean to be open now
S0018	oh be it yeah just now that the weather's get crappy
S0033	it's mean to open first of april but uh i don't know what's go on with it but yeah interest to anybody listen to this because my accent change every five minutes
S0018	it do
S0033	i've no idea why it's cos i i travel the country play tennis i get friends from all over the place and i use to spend weeks and weeks in wales and up north and then down south and bristol and then london and
S0018	yep oh really mm you're a linguistic nomad
S0033	i think so my accent tend to change sometimes i sound like i'm from up north sometimes i sound like i'm welsh
S0018	sometimes you have get a brummie twang
S0033	i've be tell i've be tell that like that like i sound like like i'm from the west country at one point i'm like i definitely do not sound like that
S0018	it's true yeah sometimes
S0033	it's just such a strange accent
S0018	and uh i think maybe there be something eastern european go on at some point
S0033	there probably be i pick up i pick up things without know it think that's get a lot to do with my music and stuff though
S0018	yeah have a musical ear be that's very
S0033	make me sound like a mongrel in my accent
S0018	woof woof okay right well you have to go teach soon don't you
