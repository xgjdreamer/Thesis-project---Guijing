S0623	what get me though be that they spend forty thousand pound or something ridiculous over the summer of redo it
S0620	but why didn't they do this before why didn't
S0623	it's so that
S0620	why do they wait for it to flood
S0623	mm
S0620	to do this
S0623	like all the cos all the stuff that they do for the forty thousand pound be nothing compare to
S0620	yeah
S0623	what they've just do because it flood which i get they have to redo it but
S0620	yeah
S0611	cos they add like a jager bar
S0567	mm i didn't
S0611	who care about jager bomb bar
S0567	realise like how badly that end of town have flood
S0623	no
S0611	so badly
S0567	like by the station all the shop down like as you walk down to sainsbury's all like those
S0623	mm

S0611	all the shop near like the pharmacy you know around that corner that be all like a in a foot of water as well
S0623	it's ridiculous i still haven't get over the fact that the flood like when you think how high
S0620	i know cos there's like
S0623	the bank be
S0623	yeah
S0620	you stand there and it's like really far away but
S0611	when you think about it it's really lucky that like the pharmacy be up step
S0623	mm
S0611	cos that would have be imagine how much like that would have cost if all of their stock like
S0623	mm
S0611	have to chuck out
S0623	that the power go out cos they'll have lose all their fridge stock
S0611	uhu

S0611	although the people who live in last next last year they didn't have a hob cos theirs be electric so they literally be cook over candle
S0567	well that's like impossible
S0611	i don't think it work probably
S0611	they be try to make toast
S0623	you can get camp toasters which i think be quite clever and they're just like little metal things that you put at an angle next to the erm flame make toast
S0611	they didn't have one of those
S0623	be that i be talk to
S0620	if they have like a camp stave

S0623	we should go camp when it's warm
S0567	i'd like to go
S0620	mm
S0611	and then want to throw it out and my mum be like but if we go camp he be like
S0611	we've have it for six years
S0623	maybe you should take your mum camp
S0611	she don't even like camp doesn't wanna go
S0623	my mum's go off camp she use to like it but
S0620	yeah my mum refuse to go camp now it's rain on us too many time
S0567	mm but er you need nice weather
S0620	and a tent that doesn't leak
S0611	mm erm we go as practice for nicaragua we go in march and it be snow
S0567	we go to the peak district to practice to go to
S0620	oh fun time
S0567	i freeze
S0620	i can imagine
S0611	i camp through africa when we go that be like intense
S0620	mm
S0611	and there be most of the nights like there be like er hole at the top it be like open and then you have like there be like because it be material the tent's like material and then there be like erm a waterproof sheet that you could put over if it start rain and when we be like right at the end it start chuck it down and it be like leak through the tent and i be so tire and who be like well i be share like with one other person she wake up and then she start to go outside and i like just didn't get up and help her
S0611	and i like be kind of half awake and i be like i could go outside and help her but then they'll just be two of us that be wet
S0611	so i stay inside and then i find a mosquito and a moth and freak out and i be like there's a mosquito she's like that's not really my biggest concern right now
S0611	like okay
S0623	we make it like a game for the kid at camp over summer cos once you're all in the tent you have a turn a torch on shine it on the mosquitos really bright and then somebody have to try and squash it
S0567	what's that game call where you put the name of someone famous on your head
S0611	i think it be botticelli but we google it and botticelli's a different thing
S0623	yeah no i think it be i'm try
S0611	that's feel like twenty question
S0623	oh be it
S0611	yeah
S0623	i dunno be it not just like i dunno but my friend's tell me about this really good game that we have to start play well sound quite like it could be quite funny it's call hat and basically you put a load of name of celebrities like we'd each choose a name of a celebrity like or a fictional character or whatever
S0567	uhu
S0623	put it in a hat and then erm oh wait maybe i'm get confuse there's two game that she tell me about
S0623	anyway so this one we'd all choose like a person erm and then the first hat or a thing and you have to describe it you pick a er one of them out of a hat shut up
S0623	you pick one of them out of a hat and then you have to describe it and you can have as many word as you want and it's like taboo or articulate
S0567	mm
S0623	and then everything go back in the hat for the second round where you only get three word to describe what's in the hat what you've pick out and then the everything go back in the hat and for the third round you can only act out to describe what it be
S0611	i'm confuse
S0567	would there would there be like four name if there's four of us
S0623	i think so
S0611	wait so everyone put one name in a hat
S0623	yeah
S0611	of a celebrity or a character
S0623	yeah
S0611	and then you pick another name out
S0623	uhu
S0611	and you've get to make people guess
S0623	what it be yeah although i don't know how that work cos surely the person that write it down will know
S0567	mm
S0620	yeah as soon as you say like one thing
S0567	mm
S0620	they'll know because they'll be like oh that's the one i write
S0623	interest i don't know
S0611	oh you know what we should do
S0611	we should put name of celebrities in hat and then we should pick one out and you should have to
S0623	and feel like this very bad idea
S0611	no and then everyone should have to act like their character
S0623	that only work if you know who they be
S0567	mm
S0623	well i've get headbands not headbands have er to do it on my phone which have get like name of people
S0611	but like so you've get to like so like you put like obvious people and like sherlock holmes or like dr who and you've get to act like that person like put an accent on and say what they would say and get people to guess what it be
S0567	they don't really have accent well they don't for me but they do for you i guess
S0623	what
S0567	like there's not
S0611	peter capaldi do though
S0567	yeah
S0623	i'm not that skilled a actor
S0567	no
S0567	's accent be amaze
S0611	well
S0623	what do you want
S0611	the drink please
S0623	erm what be the other one the other be i feel like 'll like this game be when you
S0611	that make me suspicious
S0611	of what you're about to say
S0623	you all put a erm a name in a hat okay and it's like a celebrity or a character or whatever and erm and you pick two out and out of them you have to say like which one you'd marry like if you have to choose one of them
S0567	i can see why you think
S0611	so that's like would you rather
S0623	yeah and then er whichever one you say you would pick you put back in the hat and then whichever one you you wouldn't you take out and then so you keep
S0611	wait say that again say that again
S0623	so whichever one you say you'd marry put back in the hat and the other one you take out and then you keep go and whichever one be leave in the hat at the end the person that write that one down win
S0611	think you be gonna say have to sleep with them
S0620	that's a
S0611	i be like that might be difficult
S0620	so the point be like write down
S0611	okay right you've get to sleep with
S0567	i know
S0611	and then you win
S0611	that would be a great game
S0567	no it wouldn't

S0567	yeah
S0611	put sentence together in reception we didn't start do read book until year two
S0623	apparently i get in a strop cos you know when they like when you first learn to read they give you book that be like focus on one word they be all focus on the word look and apparently i get like my third one open it and like not look again and throw the book on the floor
S0623	no i use to hate it cos they use to make me read like school book and they be so bore
S0567	mm

S0567	what be it
S0611	shoe
S0567	oh
S0623	and the word simplify and a question mark next to it
S0623	oh nice but i don't know why oh at six b i get some really long wind answer
S0567	my one be like that long
S0620	yeah mine's like just fit on the page
S0623	and i've write the word simplify next to it but i don't want to look at it and try and simplify it
S0567	yeah i know
S0623	i think i try by the look of it
S0620	cos it's get es and like sign and cause
S0623	yeah
S0620	so you'd think yeah no
S0567	i literally
S0620	i just
S0567	hate sign and cause
S0623	i know
S0620	i sign it thank you
S0611	i hate more than sign and cause actually
S0623	yeah
S0611	i mean and the the
S0620	do you have a weird graph
S0623	i didn't
S0567	damn
S0623	i i have to look up
S0567	that's so weird
S0623	how to put invert cot into my calculator
S0620	be it not a function
S0623	yeah
S0620	like
S0611	yeah no it's definitely a function
S0623	it's it's not a it's not a function on my
S0567	yeah
S0620	calculator
S0620	oh right
S0567	but you need to get a new calculator
S0623	like
S0611	yeah
S0567	get one like me and have get
S0611	yeah
S0611	you can borrow mine if you want
S0620	to do inverse cot
S0611	i mean i'll probably need it for tomorrow
S0611	for my quantum mechanics but
S0611	yeah you can borrow it
S0623	i don't think i've bring my do i just have it i'm really confuse
S0620	i didn't see you with it but i wasn't really pay attention
S0567	do your korfball top arrive
S0623	my korfball top
S0567	yeah
S0623	yeah i have it before the holiday
S0567	oh do you
S0623	yeah it's just erm i realise the other day that i be play in and my top be in so i borrow one
S0567	what number do you go for in the end
S0623	fifty four
S0567	fifty four
S0623	and i've get one capital not all capitals i can't remember whether it be you or that be i think it be you
S0611	what do you mean capitals
S0623	my surname we spend age try to decide whether to do it all capitals or just one capital
S0611	oh you just do v to start with
S0623	i could have have the whole thing in capitals
S0611	but that's not right that's grammatically
S0611	incorrect
S0623	on the back like on the back of her top
S0567	oh
S0623	no on the back of my top
S0623	not just in live
S0620	yeah just in general always put it all in capitals
S0611	yeah once someone read it then it's like fifty four
S0623	no a lot of people on sport top do their name in capitals
S0611	no
S0567	no they do that's like a thing
S0620	yeah
S0623	but it look weird
S0567	yeah
S0623	for cos i think it's quite long it's
S0611	like it's too angry in capitals
S0567	it could just be excite
S0623	yeah
S0567	like
S0611	like
S0623	with that
S0567	you have to do the
S0623	i want to sit with my legs cross
S0620	sit down here
S0623	i'm not not allow i will in a second
S0567	it look a bite like erm
S0623	i'm not allow to sit with my legs cross
S0620	why not
S0567	i feel like a whale or a dolphin
S0620	cos they make them all wonky
S0623	that's
S0623	yeah apparently when she hit forty
S0567	and i be tell her parent about how you call me a horse and then you be like oh no but a thoroughbred
S0567	and they be like that's actually really bad cos the thoroughbreds be really stupid
S0567	and it's like
S0623	this be report
S0620	oh okay
S0620	have you type it up
S0623	yeah
S0620	that's really something
S0623	and then this be me try to
S0567	oh
S0623	understand relativity
S0620	mm
S0623	which actually i should probably give this back cos i didn't realise it have stuff in it
S0620	what be it
S0623	i think it's my mum's bank statement she might want this
S0611	yeah don't steal that from her
S0623	it'll be like oh no i've get that oops
S0567	oh
S0623	okay this be as far as i get with draw a diagram for for question one
S0620	yeah
S0623	no that one that one
S0620	that's that's like what you want you just erm yeah no question one be just the axis isn't it
S0623	yeah
S0620	that's like air and then maybe put the angle in but i'm not really sure if they want an angle
S0611	yeah they definitely want the angle
S0623	i've work out the angle
S0620	yeah what do you get
S0567	i do the angle
S0611	yeah same
S0623	i get forty point nine
S0620	that's what i get
S0623	from your the vertical
S0620	so i i put i put that i just put an angle on it just because
S0623	okay
S0620	it's more information but yeah i think question one just want like the ax and that's about it
S0623	and then question two i have answer for all of it except d i think
S0611	do you want the d though
S0620	i need the d
S0611	well then let's find the d
S0623	right and the question 4c when ask why it's heavier than it be before what's the answer
S0620	it
S0623	a hat
S0567	too much christmas pudding
S0620	it go through a collision and like stuff happen
S0623	erm i've get kinetic energy be not conserve in a in inelastic collision so it be convert to heat energy which increase the mass in relativity why do it increase the mass
S0620	yeah no that's that's basically it
S0611	cos if you go in a collision you get emotional scar and
S0611	fill fill that emotional scar void
S0623	with food
S0611	with food
S0623	yeah
S0620	and also you can get condensation and it make your pocket heavier
S0623	true
S0620	so then they buy more food eat more food and they go etcetera
S0623	do people beep who have like
S0623	hips
S0611	beep
S0620	yeah
S0611	who have what
S0623	hips
S0567	do people who beep who have hips
S0623	yes
S0567	i know what you mean
S0620	i know yeah
S0623	yeah yeah
S0567	i don't know
S0623	replacement be the word i be look for
S0611	can't take that off
S0567	exactly
S0623	no i never why understand why bras don't beep
S0620	it's a really low amount
S0567	yeah
S0623	amount of er i dunno
S0623	yeah but still
S0620	yeah
S0567	mm
S0620	i dunno my belt always beep
S0611	but like the zip on your jeans though
S0567	they make they make you take your belt off don't they
S0623	mm
S0620	yeah true
S0611	no they don't anymore
S0623	they do
S0620	they do
S0611	they never make me take

S0620	yeah
S0567	he have to put it in the little box thing
S0611	well i always get to keep my belt on and my shoe
S0611	never make me take mine
S0620	i guess it depend on the belt
S0623	it depend on what shoe you've get
S0620	and the shoe yeah
S0623	yeah it depend what
S0620	yeah
S0623	shoe you're wear
S0567	i don't think there's any of these that

S0623	but i look last year and cos i like be ill all the time i wasn't allow and it be like oh you can't have have a sore throat in the last two years or well that's
S0620	two years
S0620	well then there's no chance
S0623	last two weeks there be no chance of me be able to do it right physics and then we can play pub quiz
S0567	yay
S0611	oh oh do it count towards your grade
S0623	yeah
S0620	well like a tiny bite
S0623	well it's it's
S0623	it'll be fifty percent of the coursework
S0620	yeah or
S0623	for one module
S0620	which isn't even a whole module cos it's relativity nuclear and particles so it's like
S0623	true but it still bring your average down
S0620	the coursework bite
S0623	if you fail
S0620	yeah but it's like the
S0611	it's like the third of an eighth
S0620	it's even smaller than that
S0611	of the yeah
S0620	it'll be tiny which be why i've be
S0611	but it still matter
S0620	do it for age i give up
S0567	yeah you wanna like do as well as you can before the exam
S0611	mm
S0620	yeah
S0623	yeah and the better you do this year
S0611	you get as many mark as you can
S0623	the worse you can do in third and fourth year
S0620	true erm
S0611	yeah
S0623	for question three
S0620	that's one way of look at it
S0623	i remember you be the only one talk about this cos finally understand what a light cone be
S0567	okay good
S0623	cos i like cos when i actually read through the note it's like oh
S0620	yeah
S0623	that make sense do you get that it's not be observe and never will be
S0620	yeah i think so
S0567	i get that as well
S0611	i disagree
S0623	well do
S0611	you can't say something will never happen
S0623	why
S0611	cos you can't see into the future
S0623	it's physics
S0611	no
S0623	yeah
S0611	no
S0623	yeah
S0611	no
S0623	yeah
S0611	no
S0623	do you know what a light cone be do you understand how physics work
S0611	yeah
S0620	light cone
S0623	that
