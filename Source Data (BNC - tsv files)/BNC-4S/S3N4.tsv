S0653	it's spaghetti carbonara
S0655	yes but i don't want pasta

S0653	you have a burger yesterday and doesn't massively like burgers but she eat it so i'd like you to try a little bite of spaghetti please

S0654	mm
S0652	why thank you very much
S0655	can i just have pasta and cheese
S0653	no cos we've mix it now
S0652	it's nice
S0654	it's not nice
S0652	it be nice
S0654	it isn't
S0652	lovely
S0653	just have a little bite please
S0655	but i don't i don't like it
S0652	well i don't like pears but to prove my love i eat some pear
S0655	yes but i don't need to prove love
S0653	no but you do need to just suck it up and eat what i serve
S0655	okay i'll have a teensy weensy bite and then i'll have something else
S0653	there you go
S0655	too big
S0653	no it isn't
S0655	it be it's pretty much the same as 's
S0652	well just eat what you can
S0655	okay i'll eat what i want do
S0653	don't be so silly
S0655	i'll eat a little bite
S0652	just try it it's very nice
S0653	now i want you eat the pancetta cos you like bacon and that's just italian bacon
S0655	jamaican italian pig
S0653	not jamaican no
S0655	jamaican bacon
S0653	jamaican bacon mm don't eat too quickly
S0655	you'll get hiccup like i do sometimes i just randomly get hiccup i wonder why you get hiccup from just
S0652	this be something sorry sorry sorry sorry
S0655	i wonder why you don't get hiccup for breathe too heavily cos if you hold your breath they go away
S0653	a spasm in the diaphragm
S0655	okay
S0652	and you use your diaphragm to breathe so when you hold your breath you basically stop use your diaphragm so your diaphragm have time to settle down and stop spasming
S0653	mm
S0652	that's what happen
S0655	okay but continue
S0652	and the reason it's spasming be just because it's not get enough blood to it therefore if you stop it from work the blood flow can then go into it
S0655	and then you die
S0652	mm
S0653	and then you die no
S0655	well you faint
S0653	no
S0654	if you hold your breath too long you do faint
S0653	it's pretty much impossible to hold your breath
S0652	until you faint
S0653	yeah
S0655	yeah but you can
S0653	but if you faint your body would then start breathe again
S0655	yeah true unless you have sellotape around your nose and your mouth then you'd die
S0652	that's call suffocate that
S0653	mm
S0655	yeah but you'd still die
S0652	that that's completely different
S0655	yeah you'd die
S0653	mm your body would still breathe though
S0655	what through sellotape
S0653	no but it would still er automatically try and take those breaths in
S0654	and out
S0653	cos that's what happen when people drown
S0652	mm they start breathe underwater
S0653	must be horrible mustn't it
S0652	yeah well apparently it's very a very peaceful death
S0653	it can't be cos when you breathe in all the water will come into your lungs and
S0652	yeah
S0653	that pressure must feel horrible
S0652	and it's the whole motion of breathe in and out
S0653	but your body would be try to get it out wouldn't it and you'd be cough and you'd be take the water in i think it'd be very painful
S0652	it's cos the oxygen because the oxygen level be already quite low you're already kind of sleepy
S0653	i'd like to see that research
S0655	that's why it's so although how can shark breathe
S0653	i don't know they've get gills haven't they
S0655	yeah
S0652	mm
S0655	do gills like let in all the oxygen and then not the water
S0653	mm
S0652	well there's oxygen in the water
S0655	yeah
S0652	and what gills do they absorb the oxygen out of the water
S0652	so they flow through and out of the gills so it go be it through the mouth and out the gills
S0653	i dunno so i don't know if they kind of breathe or not i dunno
S0655	shark
S0653	but whale need to come up for air don't they
S0652	yeah
S0655	yeah
S0653	mm
S0655	and
S0653	which seem a bite ridiculous
S0655	so do dolphins
S0653	no they i know they can hold it for age but it just seem like a really
S0652	hours and hours they can hold it
S0653	i know but why hasn't it evolve so they just can be under the water the whole time just seem a completely unnecessary thing
S0652	cos they're mammals
S0653	mm
S0655	it would take a lot of evolve maybe they be evolve
S0653	mm
S0652	but when you're that big
S0655	mm
S0652	you don't really have a a natural predator do you
S0653	apart from us
S0652	in the wild
S0653	no but i'm just say
S0655	no they're our predators
S0653	they're too big to be out of the water oh there be some whale wash up this week weren't there
S0655	yeah
S0653	very sad
S0652	mm
S0653	very sad so they can't exist outside of the water so it seem
S0652	no
S0653	weird that they have that connection outside of the water still
S0652	but the only reason that they can't survive out of the water be because their body weight be so huge
S0653	mm
S0652	the pressure be too much on their internal organs and that's why they die
S0653	i know but they use to walk
S0652	do they
S0653	yeah
S0652	what be they
S0653	what be they
S0652	mm
S0653	they be whale but they could they could walk when you look at the whale have you erm i've tell you this before in the natural history museum or in fact in the zoology museum in if you look at a skeleton of a whale embed in the tale be these kind of two flipper like things which be in the flesh they're not use and they be the throwback to when they have legs it's the same for dolphins
S0652	well maybe
S0653	but they be much smaller then
S0652	thousands of years ago they use to escape dinosaurs by run into the water
S0652	and they go they
S0653	whale
S0652	mm
S0653	i don't think they be around
S0653	in dinosaur time
S0654	how do you know
S0653	they
S0652	evolve
S0653	they definitely do walk
S0652	okay well
S0653	yeah
S0652	maybe they evolve to just live in the water to avoid all the
S0653	yes they do evolve to live in the water i don't know why i don't think it's to do with dinosaurs however to change the subject what i would like to know be why do we say red amber green and not red red orange green
S0652	cos it's not orange it's amber
S0653	it be orange
S0654	mum can i have my second portion
S0655	yeah
S0653	it be orange
S0652	it's not
S0654	mm
S0653	well you've just take all the pancetta you can put that back and have some more pasta
S0654	that be very that wasn't very nice you take all the pancetta
S0655	actually there's lot of there's a quite a bite of pancetta there
S0653	put it back and have some more of the pasta that's in there cos you've have hardly any
S0654	okay i'll have some more
S0653	be amber a specific shade then i mean amber you can get green amber and yellow amber and
S0655	yeah
S0653	it be orange
S0652	it's not orange kinda like golden yellow
S0652	or amber
S0654	and also erm there isn't another green
S0653	well there be there's load of different type of word for green
S0654	okay
S0652	like emerald
S0653	or jade
S0655	or green
S0654	yeah but it sound nice amber
S0654	like
S0653	i always think it be a bite weird
S0655	and emerald be a type of stone
S0653	it's a type of it's a shade of colour of green
S0654	yeah but emerald be
S0653	but amber isn't
S0653	a kind of umbrella term be it
S0652	yeah but i suppose some people say amber to know that you're talk about traffic light
S0653	they don't necessarily do they
S0652	wait for the yellow light and you think yellow light what be you on about
S0653	it's not yellow
S0652	okay it's okay wait for the amber light they go ah now you're talk about

S0655	can i have some crisp now
S0654	ow
S0653	no you can't have some crisp
S0655	why not
S0653	cos you've have some pasta
S0655	crisp
S0653	you can have some fruit i can cut up an apple
S0652	it's because i'm big and i need to eat lot
S0654	so do i
S0653	could have the burger bun just on its own with butter margarine
S0654	it's not
S0655	be pasta carbohydrate

S0653	yes
S0655	then why aren't i allow crisp
S0653	cos you're suppose to be have pasta so you're certainly not gonna have some crisp
S0652	mm and there's a balance in pasta with carbohydrates and protein and protein be in in the pancetta
S0653	and the cheese and the egg
S0652	and the cheese and the egg yeah
S0654	they're nice
S0653	so it's a more balance meal
S0652	mm
S0655	then if i'm allow
S0652	so if you stop
S0655	burger bun then why aren't i allow crisp instead
S0653	cos it's better
S0652	mm
S0653	there's less salt there's no salt hardly any in that
S0655	but there's no but i'm i'm but there's some new crisp so we're not i'm gonna be have ready salt
S0653	all crisp have get salt on them
S0652	mm
