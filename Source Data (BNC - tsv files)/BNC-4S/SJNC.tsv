S0611	it's mouldy
S0567	yeah
S0611	no
S0623	i just don't know how to draw erm diagram i think i've do everything else
S0620	yeah
S0623	it's the it's the question where it's like calculate this in both frame in frame f it make no sense to me
S0620	basically c you have to do to draw b so c we think be just the calculation you do so that you can draw b b be like what the hell be happen
S0623	but i just need to see like
S0620	b
S0623	what you've do cos i have no idea where to start with it so
S0611	what
S0623	erm
S0623	yeah and i need to split my code
S0620	oh
S0623	and do my read file i still don't know what i'm gonna write in the report either

S0623	i've do my introduction and my code design and i've make a film and i've do all my diagram and stuff yeah
S0620	that's the bite that take age
S0623	it's just analyse
S0620	okay
S0623	i analyse the energy and the frame period and how how have you do the
S0620	from well i realise now that there's like an equation but i do it from the energy cos from the my energy oscillation be really weird cos there's only three body
S0623	okay
S0620	so but that's get a period like the oscillation
S0620	so obviously you can relate that to that time period
S0623	okay cos my period oscillation vary depend on what my size of delta t be and how often i print data
S0620	yeah okay
S0623	yeah
S0620	oh yeah i don't know yeah
S0623	yeah i be gonna do energy and how how that change with respect to

S0620	so he start optimistic and then he be like wait no
S0623	to be fair we do that in the pharmacy it's like we'll be like oh yeah it'll probably be a little while it'll be like mm half an hour to forty minutes like you're just just like it's be oh i dunno i don't nah

S0623	maybe that's cos it's holiday still
S0620	but

S0611	and i forget but then i come back up for a book so i like go through the fridge and chuck away everything that be mouldy and and like on the side and everything
S0623	yeah i like i be have these revelations i only realise like two weeks ago that i'd leave my egg
S0611	yeah
S0623	it probably wasn't even that it be probably about a week ago cos we be talk about shop and i be like oh i've leave like ten egg in my canister and i've leave a box of
S0623	melon on the side which i really need to empty cos it's disgust and then like two weeks
S0611	oh yeah
S0623	into the holiday i have this realisation that i have biscuits it's like i really want a biscuit and then i dunno i it's like i have an open packet of malt milk in the cupboard i know
S0611	be they okay
S0623	i don't know
S0611	they might be okay
S0620	she's afraid to look
S0611	they might be okay
S0623	they'll have all go soggy
S0620	no they'll have go all fusty and like soft
S0623	fusty
S0567	well the the top ones might
S0620	yeah they go fusty but the
S0611	but the ones underneath it it's airtight
S0620	really i'll have a look
S0611	them erm bananas be gross
S0620	oh
S0611	they be literally all black and they have green fur come out of them
S0623	see this be another thing be if we shop together we won't end up with like three bunch of bananas
S0620	yeah
S0611	yes
S0567	cos i be gonna buy some in sainsbury's the other day but they be like eight in a bunch and i be like i'm not gonna eat
S0623	yeah
S0567	eight bananas
S0623	uhu
S0567	well we could make banana cake again
S0623	exactly
S0611	and stuff like meat like like meat like tea like
S0567	uhu
S0611	they come in big packets it's easier to buy
S0620	yeah
S0611	a pack and then we've just like get one to fit in
S0567	yeah
S0611	the freezer yeah
S0623	yeah in the freezer yeah
S0567	yeah
S0611	or the fridge stuff like that be easier
S0623	yeah
S0620	and like stuff with a short date we can just eat it
S0611	yeah
S0623	oh and there's a squash on the bench but it's stay on the bench cos it apparently doesn't need to go in the fridge
S0611	okay
S0567	what's that
S0623	a butternut squash
S0567	yeah okay
S0623	erm yeah and the carrots aren't in the fridge cos they wouldn't fit but they maybe should go in the fridge cos
S0620	yeah
S0623	the last couple of time i've have carrots they've go off really quickly even if i put them in the fridge
S0620	cos it's quite warm in the house yeah
S0623	yeah but if they're in the fridge
S0620	yeah i don't know why they've go off maybe you're just buy bad carrots
S0611	what be bad carrots
S0620	like if they be if they be already like a bite bendy
S0623	well i should probably find some money actually
S0611	i mean i wouldn't would have buy bendy carrots
S0620	apparently once they've go bendy she sound like like oh no apparently once carrots go bendy they've lose like all their nutritional value and there's no point in eat them
S0611	yeah but i've never have a bendy what's a bendy carrot carrots just snap
S0620	no no like yeah but like if they go off they
S0623	what
S0620	they go bendy
S0611	oh
S0567	carrots yeah
S0623	yeah they go like rubbery
S0620	they go like
S0611	oh we always
S0620	all like
S0611	eat them before they go off
S0623	oh
S0620	good for you
S0620	with your large carrot assumption
S0623	i might actually have change five
S0623	what
S0567	you know like you look like the cookie monster
S0611	except it's money and you've
S0611	it's really you look nothing like the cookie monster
S0620	you just look like a monster
S0611	your hair look nice
S0623	thank you i'm think about grow my fringe out
S0611	oh
S0623	cos it's like if you
S0567	bite scary
S0623	it's be annoy me for a while and apparently it's easier to cut one in than it be to grow it out so i think if i grow it out and then don't like it i can just get it cut back in
S0611	yeah
S0567	that's a good
S0620	where be you gonna part your hair though
S0623	side
S0620	oh side like oh yeah cos then you'll just get a
S0623	exactly
S0620	side fridge
S0623	yeah and then it'll grow out
S0620	and that'll grow out yeah
S0623	cos i feel like i it like it work on you but i feel like if i have er curtain it would just look weird
S0620	yeah
S0623	cos like my fringe isn't long enough
S0620	well my curtain be be separate by my glass
S0623	yeah
S0623	and it's like it cos i think i dunno it's just not as noticeable on you
S0620	mm like
S0611	i mean i get a middle part it do for my hair and it look terrible and i really regret it i wish i'd do a side one
S0623	see i don't really have a part
S0620	yeah yours just kind of come from the middle there
S0623	it just kind of start there
S0611	yeah
S0623	like and i sometimes try and part it and it doesn't do but the last couple of days cos my fridge have be drive me mad i've just be do this and it kind of stay and so i think i might do it i can't remember whether i do it that way or the other way but yeah i figure if i do like a side part
S0567	yeah
S0623	and then if i don't like it i can just grow it out
S0611	yeah
S0567	erm i have
S0623	that's not what i mean and then i could get it cut back in
S0567	yeah
S0611	have you get change er well i've get exact change be all on the table there so
S0567	i've get yeah i've get exact change or i can give someone a ten pound note and
S0623	well we have exact change here so
S0611	yeah
S0567	okay fine
S0620	what be you get

S0623	the pound coin aren't they
S0567	sorry
S0623	they're change it

S0611	gonna be yeah
S0623	it's gonna be twelve side
S0620	oh my god
S0567	twelve side
S0611	why

S0620	what be the keep like fat and gold
S0611	fat and gold
S0567	well you know like the fifty p it's like get more
S0611	skinny and silver

S0567	it be
S0620	if they that that would be really heavy wouldn't it
