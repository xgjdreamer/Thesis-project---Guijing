S0309	i be assure the boat be in good nick and they have chart and have everything else because because say to him look if you need to get this boat out i've get a friend who's get his yacht master cos i just pass my yacht master and and we do quite a lot of sail anyway and and he'll sail the boat for you mm so have check that he's get everything i take a fortnight off work
S0268	mm
S0309	to sail this help sail this boat with and a boss bloke and it be fifty foot lovely boat but it hadn't be sail nothing have be do to it
S0268	but how do you get to
S0309	erm fly we fly out there he get us a visa and everything
S0268	mm very difficult to get a visa
S0309	anyway i don't know what pretext we get it on i i go to
S0268	mm yeah but you be there anyway
S0309	yeah and that be a a real opener actually and i'm not particularly enthral with
S0268	no no no
S0309	obviously very rich
S0268	right
S0309	but a lot of poverty there as well
S0268	mm
S0309	but the anyway erm we spend three days in and go to have a look at a boat and it be really it be a complete shamble there be no chart no nothing
S0308	what sort of boat you talk about
S0309	sail boat with an engine
S0308	right
S0309	it's fifty foot long
S0308	right
S0309	eh
S0308	masts
S0309	yes two masts ketch rig erm
S0308	right
S0309	erm eh anyway
S0308	what's wooden hull or
S0309	eh yes yeah it be a norwegian design
S0308	right mm
S0309	with a point stern fortunately which be quite good in rough seas come up behind you
S0308	be that recently make or
S0309	yes he'd be build itself he buy the hull from somewhere and he be fit out the inside himself
S0308	mm ah alright okay
S0309	and he fit it all out and this be where this come into the story
S0308	mm right
S0309	eh anyway we have to sail this boat out i mean it be a nightmare from start to finish cos you have to go out to go to pick the boat up from and then you have to check out back somewhere else to get the customs clearance but once you've clear customs there you can't get back in again
S0268	right
S0309	so we know we be knackered for go into anywhere if there be any problems
S0308	ah
S0309	but equally he hadn't get any chart anywhere else
S0308	mm
S0309	we have a glorify a a map
S0309	you know of the
S0309	i mean well the be be quite wide and it's quite deep except at the edge you've get coral
S0268	mm true
S0308	oh
S0309	so if we be in daylight
S0308	gosh
S0309	yeah we have and of course when we go i forget it be october i think november the prevail wind be north
S0308	mm
S0309	so it's smack down the so we have to tack all the way up
S0308	mm
S0268	good lord
S0309	the first i mean they be and this bloke be argue from the from the off and but they both retire to their bunk for the first thirty six hours sea sick
S0309	so i i i i be sail his boat virtually single handedly tack up the bloody he'd have a self tack headsaw which make it a bite easier
S0268	yeah
S0309	i didn't have to to keep run up the but it's a nightmare cos you've get all these freighters come down and they don't keep a watch or anything you know
S0308	no
S0309	be suppose to give way to sail but they never do so it be it wasn't yeah it be a nightmare but anyway we all get back back together again but then the generator pack in so all the food we get in the freezer go off
S0268	oh no
S0309	we have to eat it in about two days cook it and ah it be a nightmare
S0268	oh god
S0309	and and the water pump pack in as well
S0308	so you have no food and no water
S0309	no no fresh water and we couldn't use the engine very much
S0268	get fish in the sea
S0309	yeah and they argue like in fact they almost come to blow at one time and and the worst
S0308	how many people be on the boat
S0309	three of us
S0308	just the three
S0309	yeah
S0308	so it be you and those two
S0309	yes and i be try to keep them apart and they be argue about this bloody generator cos the generator belt keep go anyway we be limp up the and you know you get top of the you get to the right and you've get the up to the leave
S0309	so we be we could see that because we do that bite in daylight
S0308	oh right
S0309	a rough idea by direct reckon where we be
S0308	so so do you go leave or right
S0309	well we go leave you see to start with but then the the wind blow up and there be a tremendous storm
S0309	and it and there's oil rig up there
S0308	oh my god
S0309	and there's islands and things but they're not really mark and we didn't have a thing any er
S0308	chart chart
S0309	any chart so we're so we're you know no radar nothing like that so we're knackered so the first night in this storm we decide to stay around this oil rig which be go so we could actually see where we go
S0308	mm good landmark or seamark yeah
S0309	so we just tack back and forth all night lock himself in his cabin he basically he be scar and so
S0309	there be this this this american this american chap american chap yeah
S0308	oh great so we can rely on you can we
S0309	so anyway by morning we could see these huge wave come down i think you know it's hopeless in a boat we can't go on further like this we've get to go and find shelter so
S0308	yeah
S0309	we decide to go back down again and go back up the but there's a there's a a a reef at the at the end of the and it's be block because in the war they'd sink boat across there very narrow entrance
S0308	oh
S0309	and the engine be on the blink we be use practically all our oil anyway we manage to get through there and get up into the so oh god relief cos we be shelter from the wind and sail we manage to sail up there a bite and eh eh anyway the engine be really we still have it tick over to keep us go
S0308	mm
S0309	and eh but it be get really bad and smoke come out of it and well the heat heat thing be go up
S0309	so so have come out of his cabin by then but the american chap be a bite gung ho and he say look we're go up here now we're go to have to land he say i'm not go to go i'm not go to put my boat in arab hand he say i don't trust bloody arabs
S0308	mm
S0309	it'll go we'll take we'll go to israel
S0308	mm
S0309	at the top of there's a tiny little bite of at the top of the five mile stretch which be
S0308	mm mm yeah
S0309	and the rest be and and
S0308	mm mm
S0309	and so he be aim for that without a chart but anyway i'm go to hoist the star and strip and he have a bloody great star and strip
S0309	it be about the size of that wall there
S0308	oh my goodness
S0309	and he hoist it up the back of the boat which be you never ever do i mean you well you shouldn't anyway but he he
S0266	what be he on what be he
S0309	well i don't know i don't know but anyway he do but what we didn't know it be the same time that the have be bomb
S0309	they have a big bomb campaign in
S0308	oh god
S0268	flag
S0309	yeah exactly well we didn't know this we hadn't get any radio communications you know we hadn't couldn't charge anything up cos we hadn't get a generator with no radio no nothing
S0268	can't believe it
S0309	so we be limp up and and i say look this engine be really dodgy you know and i be down below deck try to sort of look at this and nurse it and see if i could find any more oil anywhere to shove in
S0308	mm
S0309	and and suddenly they say there's something outside here we can hear noise there's boat around go around us look outside and you could hear this muffle thing and two boat there and suddenly these search light come on

S0268	what from
S0309	from
S0268	from right okay
S0309	yeah
S0266	so what happen to the boat
S0309	it's still there as far as i know
S0266	and the
S0309	the american come up to me actually and he say he say he i don't know
S0268	what the boat's still there and the be still there
S0309	i i i i think i do correspond with him i i think he might have get get it mend and get somebody else to take it round for him but he say oh it's be a pleasure sail with you that arsehole i'll never ever have him near me again
S0268	no no mm how funny
S0309	so but erm it be an interest trip

S0309	yes yeah because they we couldn't let them know where we be what have happen course we couldn't
S0308	no mobile phone in them days

S0266	she must have wonder what on earth
S0309	yes i mean she'd be check through the life insurance and everything
S0309	but no i mean it be an interest trip but it it it teach me that you know i'm very careful who i sail with these days

S0309	mm
S0268	mm
S0308	so they have to take it in turn to do listen at night
S0309	mm
S0308	to see if they could hear any big bird come and if they do they have a torch and all they could do be shine the torch on the sail
S0309	yeah that's a standard yes yes
S0308	and you think but it take a long time for a boat you know to manoeuvre around a craft like that
S0268	yeah mm
S0309	the trouble be that yeah a lot of them don't keep watch though so you've get to always assume that they
S0308	yeah yeah

S0308	i remember the first night we we we go we arrive in in in and we stay overnight at this well we sleep in the car actually if the truth be know because we weren't sure where we be
S0308	it be
S0309	be that before or after you'd be drink
S0308	that be before believe it or not and then we'd look in the erm we'd look in the travel book and it recommend this wonderful place to go and have breakfast and we sleep in the car outside this place till it open up it open up and we go in and we have breakfast and we think how would this possibly have get into some guidebook as be recommend for breakfast
S0308	anyway we have the breakfast it be like get the slice of bread and it be like lard to put on the bread and and we come out i say i can't believe that there's a and we look at it and go oh god should've be next door
S0308	we be in the wrong place but we then drive through the mountains this be from the sea we go into this little village and as it be dark it be night time and as we drive through the village there be shop with the most bizarre nature it be like ski shop and and we think why would you have a ski shop in we just we just be we just be down we just
S0266	whereabouts be you then
S0308	can't remember where it be it be it be in the
S0266	
S0308	yeah and we we we we get in we get into this little restaurant you know and we say we'd have a bottle of the local wine we we all take it and we go oh my goodness what be that
S0309	yeah
S0308	anyway we eventually acquire a taste as you do and then this other group of four people come in and we just look at each other and go i wonder if they've have the wine before we just watch them
S0309	yeah it get better as you drink more
S0308	they order the local wine they all drink and go oh my goodness what be this exactly the same as
S0309	yeah terrible
S0266	but it's change now you it's quite difficult to get
S0308	be it what be
S0266	we have the most amaze erm
