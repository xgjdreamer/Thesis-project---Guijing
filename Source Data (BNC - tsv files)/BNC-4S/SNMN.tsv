S0570	who
S0517	who be
S0517	slow twitch fibres
S0572	yeah
S0517	what do that mean
S0572	it's
S0571	well it's if you've get propensity
S0572	so like
S0571	in your body
S0517	mm
S0572	have lot of slow twitch fibres that's why he couldn't run long distance
S0571	mm
S0572	and usain bolt's get really short twitch fibres
S0571	right so say you get a hundred percent of your body be make up of certain fibres yeah
S0517	mm
S0571	you have a propensity so you might have forty percent that be slow twitch forty percent that be erm fast twitch and obviously if you're a sprinter you want more fast twitch erm fibres cos they react quicker
S0517	right
S0571	and slow twitch be about endurance and then you've get twenty percent that be undetermined and depend on what train you do
S0517	yeah
S0571	you can train those fibres to be fast or slow twitch
S0517	why have i never hear of this
S0571	i'm quite surprise cos you be the font of all knowledge
S0517	i've never hear of that
S0571	be you gonna dispute it

S0571	you've see run everyone
S0517	yes he's very really really fast but he's say he's better
S0570	so he he's obviously so he's obviously and that's why they're laugh at it
S0517	oh okay okay okay okay i've get it i miss the first part
S0572	yeah it's quite hard work
S0517	yeah
S0570	harder than me
S0517	mm so what do do other than football cricket
S0572	yeah
S0570	mm
S0571	he do athletics as well doesn't he
S0570	not outside of school
S0517	pardon

S0517	oh okay do you enjoy that
S0570	it be fine thank
S0571	what do say about the coach do he mention it to you

S0517	that be kind of him
S0570	that be good
S0517	do the lesson not usually flow that well
S0570	it's only usually like like he be give me like big tip like so instead of him mention all the progression part he would when mr go go to go give his wife back his key he tell me to do all the progression part so like when we be in the drill for me to change the drill before he do it
S0517	oh okay
S0572	can i have that orange please
S0517	yeah
S0571	and do you do you feel comfortable do that
S0570	it be alright but he still keep the he still have a better group
S0517	who do
S0570	mm
S0517	who do he have
S0570	he have when when you're feed in he always take the better group like and and i always get like
S0571	be they easier to coach do you think
S0572	er
S0517	the finger
S0570	i don't know they mess about more
S0571	oh do they be that why he take them do you think
S0570	no i'd say yeah i'd say the younger ones mess about more
S0517	no the younger ones mess about more
S0571	oh do they
S0517	i didn't know he always give you the same
S0570	most of the time he do yeah like
S0517	mind you
S0570	once he tell me to go and watch a court he'll give me the worser players
S0517	mind you when he worser when he er when you're at squad he always favour you and over the weaker players
S0570	yeah that's what he do
S0517	so why do he do that then because he can improve them more or because he just prefer the better players
S0572	probably more interest aren't they
S0570	always use to do it didn't he
S0517	do he
S0570	he always have the top group on a saturday coach
S0517	oh do he
S0571	then there's also a a temptation that if you're if you're a a better player to be less focus and muck about more because you're not be challenge
