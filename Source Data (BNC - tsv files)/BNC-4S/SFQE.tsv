S0514	fine
S0511	now know
S0512	theorise
S0514	nothing
S0512	knowledge
S0514	mm
S0511	well what have you do so you've be do it for half a term now like what
S0514	yeah
S0511	on earth have you do
S0514	well
S0512	bugger all
S0514	mm not very much really
S0511	well what happen in the sessions
S0514	there be some watch videos and stuff
S0511	about what
S0513	and erm have
S0514	like mm
S0513	mm
S0514	there be stuff about colour perception we do it for a bite
S0511	doesn't have any colour perception
S0513	oh shut up
S0513	i do but i can tell the difference between red and blue
S0511	okay
S0514	er
S0511	what so that's a good point right
S0514	stuff like that
S0511	so when
S0513	how many hours a week do you do this
S0514	what give word mean
S0513	hello
S0514	we start do the more complicate
S0512	hello
S0514	logic stuff and it turn out the teacher doesn't understand it and completely fail
S0511	great
S0511	so hang on a minute the colour perception cos that's gonna be because you know you and i know that that's blue but
S0513	no it's not
S0511	know it's black
S0514	mm
S0511	so i guess that it's
S0512	well 's
S0511	quite a good but that's quite a good example then
S0512	cos it's
S0511	of like how
S0512	well
S0511	we know whether
S0512	but it's
S0511	or not we know
S0513	yeah it's
S0512	yeah
S0513	in the
S0514	do you know the monty hall problem
S0513	genes and
S0511	monty hall
S0514	yeah
S0511	no
S0514	erm so
S0514	when you've get three doors and there's two goats and a car
S0511	right
S0512	interest
S0511	oh that if you open the first one
S0513	oh yeah yeah
S0514	yes that one
S0513	i know what you mean
S0512	what
S0514	yeah our teacher give us the wrong answer to that
S0512	like what be that sorry
S0514	you're suppose to choose another door
S0511	explain it to
S0514	yeah er
S0512	oh yeah
S0514	well
S0512	oh yeah
S0514	yeah
S0512	yeah i
S0514	yeah yeah our
S0514	teacher say that that's an illusion and you're not suppose to choose another door it's the same for most of the lesson
S0513	wait how do how do it wait do it again to me erm can't remember it
S0514	so there's three doors
S0511	can i have your leftover food
S0514	er there's a goat behind two of them and a car behind one of them
S0513	yeah
S0514	you choose one then someone open another door and it have a goat behind it should you change which one you choose assume you want a car
S0513	yeah because then you've get a fifty fifty chance right
S0511	mm
S0514	er
S0512	but you have
S0514	actually it's a two thirds chance
S0512	if you change
S0513	be it
S0514	mm
S0512	yeah
S0511	so i so you
S0512	but
S0514	what you're effectively do be choose both the goat the both your already open door and the car one
S0511	hang on a minute
S0514	and the other one
S0511	can we just start
S0514	and take whichever one's
S0511	hang on a minute can we just start again so i've get a door
S0511	a b and c
S0514	yeah
S0511	and there be there behind them there's two goats and a car and
S0514	yes
S0511	we're assume you want the car
S0514	yeah
S0511	so in my head i'm go to choose door a
S0514	you say you choose you're go to choose door a
S0511	okay i choose door a
S0514	yeah and then
S0511	do it get open
S0514	someone else open say
S0512	door
S0514	door b and there's a goat behind it
S0511	okay
S0514	should you switch
S0511	so
S0512	to door c
S0511	and i know that the truth be you should
S0514	yes
S0511	so when i've make my first decision there be a one in three
S0514	yeah
S0511	chance
S0512	yes
S0514	so what you're gonna effectively do now be choose both the other doors and take whichever one be right
S0511	how can i do that
S0514	well if you if you swap to the other one
S0511	c
S0514	yeah
S0512	yeah
S0514	then you er it's like a way of imagine it it just if you swap to the other one then there's a chance that the car we can i dunno i don't know how to explain it better than you can effectively choose the other two
S0511	you're really not cut out for a teacher be you so behind door we can now disregard door b
S0514	yeah
S0512	mm
S0511	let's go and we know
S0514	well no we can't disregard door b
S0511	ah
S0514	cos there's still three doors
S0512	mm
S0513	yeah and you just know that
S0514	we just know that one of them have the goat behind it
S0511	and so we've get two remain doors
S0512	one with a goat
S0511	and a fifty fifty chance of one have a goat of of er of either of them have the car
S0514	yes
S0511	so why do me change my mind
S0514	well er it's definitely better than the first one because that be a one third chance
S0511	yes so i so i'm
S0512	well
S0511	already down to fifty fifty
S0514	yeah but
S0511	so why
S0514	i think it's also two thirds i can't in fact remember
S0513	oh great
S0511	but your
S0512	but if it's
S0511	teacher have this wrong
S0514	yeah
S0513	what do he say or she
S0514	he say that that's like an illusion and you're suppose to it doesn't matter whether you
S0513	well
S0514	do any way
S0512	i it i er
S0514	and he also back this up with some really rubbish statistics where basically
S0511	mm
S0514	we do it three time
S0511	mm
S0514	and do it four time sorry and we get a fifty percent chance of get the car but the person who be do it didn't always switch or stay
S0511	right so that you're and so the you weren't do the same
S0514	yeah
S0511	thing over so you can
S0513	that's just bloody stupid isn't it
S0514	yes it be
S0511	so be you say that towards the end of the lesson you manage to convince the teacher of what wasn't right
S0514	yes
S0511	and how do you do that
S0514	one of the people in our class do a good explanation of it
S0511	erm and convince the teacher
S0514	yeah
S0513	really
S0511	okay i can't believe the teacher be teach like do he by mistake start do this or be this like do he have like the materials to do this problem
S0514	mm he have materials to do the problem
S0511	well and actually he have get the answer wrong
S0514	yeah
S0511	that's unbelievable
S0513	yeah
S0511	be that because he be like you know your other teacher who as far as i can tell be actually younger than you
S0514	he's not that young
S0512	what age be he
S0513	neither be you
S0514	i dunno
S0511	now put your phone down please well at least he back down i mean that's good
S0514	yeah
S0511	that and that's reasonably unusual as well how many people be in your lessons
S0514	er
S0513	toc
S0514	like eighteen maybe
S0513	maybe
S0511	oh so quite a lot then
S0511	this goulash it's very nice
S0513	mm
S0512	would you like to finish mine
S0511	no i'm just finish off 's
S0511	besides i'm suppose to stop finish off everybody's food now i've come back from
S0511	no it's really very nice i can't understand how they mm say that this be for two people it's just absolutely bizarre
S0513	yeah i know i can't believe that one person could eat it i mean it's disgust
S0511	oh it's not disgust you've eat some of yours and you should be really like the thing you cook
S0513	well it's not very
S0512	surely he have more
S0513	why not
S0514	you be only use a recipe
S0513	yeah
S0511	well i suppose they say one of the reason to get kid to do cook be that they're they're more likely to kind of enjoy it if they've make it themselves
S0514	mm
S0511	that's what they say you know that kind of contribute to the process
S0514	i'm not quite sure about that
S0513	if you do like it then it's nicer if you've make it but if you
S0511	okay
S0513	if it taste horrible then it's just you know horrible
S0511	but it's not horrible oh maybe the problem be
S0514	if you make it you have
S0511	you're not have sour cream with yours
S0514	if you make it
S0513	just
S0514	you have some control
S0513	not very nice
S0514	over it and you can get rid of the worst bits
S0511	what the so the sour cream bits yeah
S0514	yeah
S0513	yeah mm
S0511	mm there be an unused bay leaf in a little bag say bay leaf
S0513	yeah i just get one from the garden
S0511	yeah and i say oh you from the garden yeah i don't know though i sort of wonder with bay leave if the dry process kind of intensify the flavour
S0513	could be
S0511	there's some things
S0513	i dunno
S0511	yeah but you know good cook all round these last three days well do guy
S0512	be exceptionally nice all of all of all of
S0511	the meat in yours be really nice
S0512	yeah the meat be but it all in all
S0511	no i don't think when we get these cos they always tend to be a bite posh the recipes er i think you tend to not you know you're like a bite of a one meal though you don't tend to like the whole do you
S0514	if carry on like this the new favourite word for britain be go to be roll dice
S0511	well cos of the noise like you can imagine they're
S0514	yeah
S0511	put it in square bracket roll dice drop dice have dice fling at him by mother that kind of thing
S0512	and an or
S0512	have dice stick up arse
S0511	don't be rude erm after you leave us
S0511	in earlier erm i erm come across er
S0513	you mean after you abandon me in an unknown place

S0512	and i have the
S0514	do you still have the map
S0513	yes it's in the kitchen i think
S0514	right
S0511	it's just but it's perfect er yeah i i say to the others that i'd get a map of and overlay so you can see how perfect it be i mean yeah i just don't know what you do but once you go wrong to begin with then you be anyway after you after we separate erm i discover that er er that that perhaps my refusal to use violence all these years be a bad idea because er be say
