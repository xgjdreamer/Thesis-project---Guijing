S0590	yeah well your beef and gammon be very organic i think it's
S0588	do you know the name of the cow
S0590	well i be just gonna say that perhaps if we'd press him
S0589	mm
S0590	we could have be tell the name
S0588	right
S0590	of the cow
S0589	be it a farmers' market on the high street
S0590	well no it be the what what be call the french market which be a once a year thing although there be surprisingly few french store there be no french cheese store
S0589	well
S0590	for instance
S0589	and
S0590	mm
S0589	will be please
S0590	well we didn't see them at all on the day of course but erm no sadly the i mean cos normally there's a fabulous cheese stall and i have think that you know we'd buy cheese there
S0589	mm
S0590	but but the lidl price of vegetables today be amaze weren't they
S0589	i didn't really notice
S0590	twenty nine p
S0588	so be say that they didn't have much in lidl though
S0590	well they didn't have any lemons
S0588	no
S0590	that's pretty amaze they didn't have any streaky bacon i mean there be vast areas the not empty but you know they be
S0588	mm
S0590	refurbish or have or have refurbish and and reach the stage where they'd run out
S0588	wow
S0590	i mean no lemons that's really quite amaze
S0589	we actually it turn out we have lemons
S0590	what dear
S0589	we actually have lemons as it turn out
S0588	mm
S0590	mm and the really frustrate thing be we mean to bring up about half a dozen lemons
S0589	home grow
S0590	home grow from our own tree
S0588	mm
S0590	as organic as we could possibly have
S0588	well the bread flour there be only two packets of bread flour in tesco so
S0590	really
S0588	obviously who have a bread maker have probably buy them up
S0590	oh
S0588	for christmas
S0590	mm
S0589	and no macaroni
S0588	no macaroni anywhere but fear not we can use pasta
S0589	just as nice
S0588	maybe everyone be put off by the news report of two hours to queue
S0590	or actually even probably more so by the the disaster at bluewater
S0588	what happen at bluewater
S0590	what happen at er two days ago it cos it be in the news yesterday
S0588	i have not see the news
S0590	no well er two days ago people be there do their christmas shop some people leave well er lot of people be sort of plan well get into their cars to leave the car park
S0588	mm
S0590	at four o'clock
S0588	yeah
S0590	they be still there leave the car park
S0590	at half past nine
S0588	no way oh my god
S0590	and some people be completely hysterical
S0588	that's a nightmare
S0590	yeah
S0588	oh my god
S0590	i would be desperate for the loo by then actually
S0589	what cause that
S0590	i mean do you remember the time when we stick at
S0588	yeah that's horrible enough
S0590	tk maxx for about half an hour
S0588	i think oh my god
S0590	yeah
S0588	cars this be horrible
S0590	mm
S0590	but they be stick for it be six hours
S0588	oh no that's
S0590	before
S0588	such a that's the stuff of nightmares
S0590	the yeah the police have to be call in the end mainly well to try and get the stuff move
S0588	well what hold it up
S0590	and to try calm people who be
S0588	well yeah you would
S0590	totally cos they couldn't move forward they couldn't move back they couldn't get out of the situation they be in
S0588	that's so they're trap isn't it
S0590	mm like we be
S0588	could they not get out of their car though
S0590	well yes yeah and i suspect that they do i think
S0589	yeah they could stroll around
S0590	but then you you hear that the carpark at bluewater be two hundred and forty acres
S0588	so
S0590	that's a hell of a
S0588	i don't know acres
S0590	well an acre be
S0588	it's that big
S0590	a football pitch be an acre i think so you're talk about
S0588	yeah
S0590	two hundred and forty football pitch well talk about
S0588	well what cause it though
S0590	just too many cars be there and you know arrive and leave at the same time and just gridlocking
S0588	oh that's so awful what terrible organisation though that that could happen
S0590	mm
S0588	i've never hear of that happen before
S0590	and people be sort of say that the whole car park area and exit and entry areas be just badly design
S0589	clearly
S0588	well obviously yes
S0590	mm
S0589	nothing
S0588	so much for just nip out to do your christmas shop
S0590	mm
S0588	oh no that would put you off go out for a while wouldn't it
S0590	mm
S0588	and the car
S0590	well interestingly today cos our our radio have a programme that i mean we're listen to classical music and suddenly the local
S0589	that's really annoy
S0590	well it's it's useful though when you're drive
S0589	not useful at all
S0590	because the m25 have problems but luckily we'd get we pass through an area then create a problem but
S0589	after what junction
S0590	they say no the junctions that be a real problem be the twelve till ten which we use but they be fine when we be there but they be say that today bluewater be very quiet
S0588	well yes i suppose it would be
S0590	and er you know
S0588	but i mean that would really traumatise you
S0590	oh yeah
S0588	for a long time
S0590	mm
S0588	if that happen
S0590	yeah
S0588	you'd probably sell your car but it make you make public transport look like heaven
S0590	mm just i mean oh
S0588	oh no dunno think what a nightmare it would be but wouldn't you just get out of your car and give up and and
S0590	well
S0588	but then you can't just leave
S0590	you can't just leave a car actually no
S0588	people think they can't leave it but on the other hand
S0590	it would have be tow away and you would have have to pay something
S0588	on the other hand and and then it would be even more gridlock cos people would
S0590	well yes yeah
S0588	have leave their car
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	but there would come a point when you'd have to do that really wouldn't you
S0590	well
S0588	if you don't know what's happen
S0590	if you're sit there for six hours
S0588	and you don't know when you're gonna get out of it you know and i suppose nobody be tell anybody what be go on either so
S0590	well
S0588	that's the other thing
S0590	i suppose you see it would be a long time before the police be call in so
S0588	yes it would
S0590	so nobody could tell anybody anything anyway
S0588	no
S0590	it's not like there's an
S0590	cos if there's
S0588	intercom system
S0590	yeah mm
S0588	at least if you're on a train there's an intercom system someone presumably well hopefully tell you why you're hold up
S0590	mm
S0588	or when you're gonna be move again
S0589	alright
S0591	yeah but be you sure this be i think this
S0589	uhu
S0591	be there more than one bluewater
S0588	er
S0591	cos i think the one they be talk about be in the west of london
S0588	there's two west what's the one at stratford call westfield
S0589	mm
S0588	there's two two westfields i think there's only one bluewater
S0589	well there's one east
S0591	yes
S0589	be there a different one
S0591	well there's a huge one somewhere in the west of
S0589	well then there be two
S0588	well then there be two
S0589	then there be two cos it's not the one that we could get the bus to if we so be incline
S0588	that's the one we keep mean to get the bus to isn't it
S0589	well not keep mean but
S0588	well one day

S0590	yeah
S0589	would have double that money already
S0590	yeah
S0590	well i mean to say they're just but it the thing that we can't understand be you know how 's tell us two hundred thousand and then oh dear he's tell us a bite later he's just discover it be three hundred and twenty nine
S0589	would have be anyway
S0590	pardon
S0589	why it occur to that that be a good idea of course be er absolutely anyone's guess
S0590	yeah but then yeah but have do you have you ask him why i ask him but i couldn't understand what he be say cos i find on the telephone it's very difficult to understand him why he do it
S0589	just scottish that's all i can put it down to
S0590	but
S0589	it doesn't make any sense from any angle
S0590	yeah
S0591	be amaze that erm
S0590	but
S0591	such a sum be accept straightaway without any sort of clear or reference to someone else
S0590	well we we also meet up up with and and 's good friend who's the bank manager of the which be affiliate with
S0589	's bank but carry on
S0590	he's what
S0589	yeah sorry
S0590	oh he's
S0589	yeah
S0590	oh yeah i be say he be well i they're all much the same actually but we be quiz him about that er you know about you know somebody who be in this stage of health walk in and say i want to
S0589	well when i be there it be none of my business so i didn't wouldn't have appreciate so i didn't but i be i i would have like to have say so hang on you be they advise him about his save account and they be i do ask that they go yes yes yes yes so then i want to say so you
S0590	you think
S0589	advise someone in their late seventies with an incurable degenerative disease to invest a windfall in a five year lock down account
S0590	yeah well you see manager of the say i mean i be think be with the and he be say you know that things have tighten up so much in in how the bank and he say it would have to be the financial advisor of the bank anyway and it would be at least two meet and he say oh the the the way in which you describe your brother er there's no way that that we would be we would be allow to do that without say to the client go away and think about it
S0589	they probably do that
S0588	no but it wouldn't it have be who be do the negotiate
S0589	i i er verbally yes but on instruction
S0588	well they might not even have meet they might not even know
S0589	no i i'm sure most of it would have be negotiate over the phone
S0588	with
S0590	oh really
S0588	well cos if uncle be negotiate it
S0589	yeah because you don't wanna trawl in
S0588	they wouldn't even understand what he say
S0590	yeah well
S0588	so he would
S0589	but would have be act under instruction make no mistake have a tight leash on his finance
S0590	but i mean there's just no it's i mean who would bet a penny on be alive in five years' time
S0589	of course he will be
S0590	yeah but pardon he will
S0589	of course he will be
S0588	well
S0590	he's about the only person who would
S0588	you know who's gonna you know who's gonna benefit from it
S0589	ms only knock off about
S0590	yes
S0589	five six years off your life expectancy so what it will what's the life expectancy for a male uk male then early eighties
S0590	well you i mean five years
S0589	it's about that
S0590	take them to there yeah
S0589	but and and then the point be the irony well not it's an irony at the end of that five years you've get fifty grand more but so what so
S0590	yeah but how do you
S0589	you've have three hundred and something anyway plus you've have another
S0590	yeah you don't need it
S0589	i think maybe it be predicate then on the fact that he know he be get more than that immediately
S0590	yeah so
S0589	and be hop he will spend
S0590	well well and i'm and i'm hop he will get
S0589	yeah he'll get it it's just be hold up by the taxman
S0590	yeah but you know that's a you know tax people be the ones who sort of find ways of take all of it don't they or you know certainly find ways to maximise the amount they can remove he's obviously give some money to
S0589	well his salary be thirty seven thousand per annum
S0591	really
S0590	's be yeah
S0589	before tax but that's three erm
S0590	pension

S0589	erm
S0590	oh right
S0589	and his state pension

S0589	why what's your be your pension a private one
S0590	our total pension for both of us be just over twenty five thousand be that right
S0589	per annum
S0591	around about
S0590	yeah
S0589	before tax
S0590	yes
S0589	what's the tax rate on a pension cos it won't be income tax will it or be it
S0590	well there be yeah but but i pay income tax
S0589	it's like capital gain i think

S0590	that council do that
S0588	yeah
S0589	yeah but if you're already pay that should be tax that shouldn't be tax anyway it's not enough
S0590	well i well i that but that's what i think
S0588	no it shouldn't be
S0589	the threshold be like twelve
S0588	the threshold be ten er it's
S0590	well i i think so i mean
S0590	yeah my salary be never four figure

S0588	i don't
S0589	well if you're over the age if you're over the retirement age would you still actually contribute to the what's it call
S0588	what national insurance contributions
S0589	yeah i think you probably would wouldn't you
S0588	maybe
S0589	that would be the only tax come out though national insurance i reckon there wouldn't be any income tax
S0590	no
S0588	i don't think there should be unless you be do a tax return and everything else be take into account
S0589	there isn't everything else
S0588	oh there isn't an everything else be there
S0590	no that's our
S0589	well it would be erm

S0590	but he wasn't there
S0589	but he wasn't it wasn't that chap
S0589	kind of annoyingly whoever it be be with his supervisor i think cos he be train more than they think this might be tricky or they might have think it might be tricky i don't know
