S0616	mm
S0588	wonder if we need little sort of label to say that's half flush and that's full flush cos there's nothing to indicate
S0589	no dear
S0588	which be the half flush
S0616	there be well there be if you look at the size of the button
S0588	oh
S0616	one's like a crescent which be
S0588	yeah
S0616	quite a bite one and the other one's a smaller one
S0588	oh
S0616	if you just
S0588	i think they be the same oh they
S0616	no if you look at them one's bigger than the other
S0588	yeah okay
S0616	but the one nearest the wall be the small
S0588	oh no that's the i oh in that case it's very good cos that's the one i
S0616	be that the right be be that how i do it
S0588	no it think it be the one i think it be the other way round er oh
S0616	oh oh i might have get
S0588	what do i
S0616	i do spin it round do it the right way but
S0588	er
S0616	can't remember
S0588	i think i flush the front one
S0616	that's the full one then
S0588	yeah
S0590	we're gonna have fun flush it that's any that's
S0588	but that's the nearest the bigger one
S0590	big or small
S0616	what right the one nearest the wall
S0588	oh okay
S0616	be the small
S0588	yeah yeah that's what it think
S0588	the one nearest the wall be the
S0616	be the small
S0588	half flush
S0616	yeah
S0588	yeah so and then oh so there's a crescent in
S0616	yeah
S0588	that one that one okay er well i wonder how long it's take to refill well we'll find out won't we
S0616	yeah yeah
S0616	yeah exactly but the thing be it's it you know even if it take the same amount of time as your old one
S0588	yeah
S0616	which i think will probably be faster cos it's all new erm the fact be be that you can actually press the button and it flush again
S0588	yeah
S0590	yes yeah exactly
S0616	yours be like ah oh
S0588	yeah
S0616	you know
S0588	but that be
S0616	yeah
S0588	such a gentle flush as well it be just press a button but no physical pressure
S0616	no exactly and i think i think like the big button for a number twos should we say
S0588	exactly
S0616	erm if you press it and hold your finger on it
S0588	oh
S0616	and hold it down it it like er totally er empty the cistern it's a good
S0590	oh it's a real
S0588	oh cos i didn't do that
S0616	no i think i think
S0588	i just go tap and and it all
S0616	yeah you tap it and it yeah it go
S0588	but it must be just a really good flush then cos it just
S0616	yeah well they're all
S0588	have a lot of suction
S0616	they're all so much better nowadays
S0588	be they
S0616	the yeah much better
S0588	the technology change for toilets do it
S0616	it's all change and it's their overflow
S0590	and and
S0588	yeah
S0590	the overflow pipe isn't need so that's the one that's actually currently go through the wall so that can be take out
S0588	what's the overflow pipe
S0590	well
S0616	well if suddenly it something get jam and it start fill up and fill up and fill up
S0590	and not stop
S0616	and fill up
S0588	mm
S0616	instead of it flood all over the toilet floor it go down the overflow pipe which be what that one be stick through the wall that's the old style
S0588	yeah
S0616	type but now it it's all internal so if it start to overflow it go down the toilet pan
S0588	oh okay
S0616	it's all clever technology

S0590	yeah
S0589	vent up there to
S0590	yeah
S0589	for the hot air
S0616	yeah
S0590	to come out what they have nowadays here be the little fan that you sit on top
S0616	oh yeah yeah yeah i
S0589	and the heat
S0616	i've get to get one
S0589	and the heat
S0590	mm
S0589	create a electricity
S0616	start it's the

S0616	mm
S0589	and for some reason don't ask me how that be able to run a current
S0616	mm
S0589	and then the
S0590	well yeah
S0589	whistle along but it cost about a hundred and something quid

S0590	this would develop an electrical
S0589	there you go
S0616	i've see the ones that
S0590	a er different potential difference
S0616	if you you sit it on top of the stave
S0589	yeah
S0616	and it work on the heat

S0590	but
S0588	a lot of people take advantage of that these days
S0590	yeah yeah
S0616	mm
S0590	but but it
S0588	so many people will to work for free
S0616	mm
S0590	well yes yes but you see it's you know when you er it it i mean i coach
S0616	mm
S0590	some erm one of the the kid in the school whom i'd give a lift to because we be both stick at the bus stop one day actually and she desperately want to get down to the train so i say to her well look i'm go back to get my car and i say you might recognise me i do invigilate in the school so that she'd be assure she wasn't get in a a car with a total and she do so
S0588	what a mess darling
S0589	no darling that's my an hour
S0588	be you go too
S0589	can i have a little beer
S0616	mm
S0590	i take her down and thereafter in school every time she saw me i get this great beam
S0590	and then i don't think i've tell you this actually
S0589	you have
S0590	oh have i because i meet her in the corridor after she'd do her mock and she'd get good as and bs and she say but i get one d and i say what what be that in and she say oh i just it's a subject i simply do not understand it's chemistry
S0616	oh
S0590	which be my subject you see
S0616	oh right
S0590	so i say to her well look you know come along and i'll give you some lessons if you want you see and the she's a her mother's a single parent now with i mean divorce parent who so little suddenly you know she be say well how much will that be
S0588	do you want another one of these
S0590	yes
S0616	er i don't want one of those
S0588	okay
S0589	's drink the
S0590	the bigger one
S0589	bring the
S0590	you know she say well how much will that be
S0589	there's one more of 's beers on the windowsill
S0590	i say i say it won't be anything at all actually i'd love love to do it
S0616	yeah
S0590	so she come along for a week every morning for a couple of hours
S0589	oh so sweet
S0590	er and just for the week and her grade which er for her mock she get a very poor d and in the actual exam she get a b
S0616	oh
S0589	oh well do
S0590	and actually reckon if she'd have one more lesson with me she would have get an a because funnily enough what i be go to do in the next lesson there be a whole question on the whole thing
S0616	thank you very much
S0589	so i think she would have actually get an a with one more lesson
S0616	that's so it just go to go to
S0590	so that the reward of that
S0616	so suddenly the penny drop
S0590	well yes
S0616	and
S0590	well i explain the the sort of fundamentals of the thing
S0616	well exactly that's all it be sometimes yeah
S0590	yes see i think chemistry be teach completely wrongly cos i think the periodic table if you remember that do you maybe not i mean the periodic table of all the elements
S0616	yeah
S0590	i actually do think that if if gcses well any student of chemistry it's even more important the higher up you go if you actually understand all that
S0616	mm
S0590	you so much of it just
S0616	er
S0590	fall into place
S0616	it's it's i remember i mean i hat chemistry at school
S0590	do you
S0616	in fact
S0590	yeah
S0616	i hat chemistry i hat biology but i love physics
S0590	yeah
S0616	but i couldn't do it er i be never any good at it because of maths
S0590	really
S0616	basically which be why
S0588	oh
S0590	be you no good at maths
S0616	er
S0590	oh no right
S0616	er i er average
S0590	yeah
S0616	but when it come to formulas and things like you'd get fluster and
S0590	yeah
S0616	but the only but chemistry and biology the reason i didn't like it cos i didn't like the teachers
S0590	yeah
S0616	didn't and
S0590	and that's key
S0616	erm
S0590	that be really be key isn't it
S0588	yeah
S0616	erm but i can't remember the biology teacher's name it be a a lady but she be just a little hitler
S0590	yeah
S0616	oh it er everyone hat her anyway
S0588	and whereas
S0590	yeah
S0588	if you'd have a good teacher
S0616	indeed indeed
S0588	it could have
S0590	yeah
S0588	influence
S0590	well
S0588	your whole life
S0590	well it it it
S0616	but yeah
S0590	influence it
S0588	yeah
S0590	and it can make or destroy your whole life
S0616	yeah
S0588	exactly
S0616	chemistry i think i think i cos i i be quite interest in you know the
S0590	the actual
S0616	the actual
S0590	subject
S0616	subject
S0590	yeah
S0616	itself
S0590	yeah
S0616	and i just remember go to first chemistry lesson or go in and he'd call out the register out and he call my surname they call your surnames don't they
S0590	yeah
S0616	and you go yes and he'd like look at me and go er have you get a brother i go yes well let's hope you work as hard as er or as half as hard as he do you know
S0588	it's just such a terrible
S0616	like that
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0616	and erm
S0590	er
S0616	that be it
S0590	well exactly
S0616	it be instant dislike
S0616	just like
S0588	oh
S0616	you don't even know me
S0590	yeah
S0616	you know and obviously
S0590	yeah
S0616	he be scottish and he use to say iron his
S0590	iron
S0616	and i i mean and i would i i would
S0616	play up on it and he get and i'd stick my hand and go
S0616	sorry i er what i sorry i didn't quite understand that
S0590	stand that
S0616	what do you say and he's go blah blah blah iron
S0590	iron
S0616	mm no no
S0616	oh what you mean iron
S0616	oh okay and then it be like that all the time
S0588	i bet he make that
S0588	you have to then sort of be a bite have an bite of attitude
S0616	oh god i i hat him
S0588	to him because he'd
S0590	yeah yeah
S0616	that be it i know er it be constant
S0588	kind of do it to you
S0590	but he first
S0590	yeah
S0616	constant but
S0590	but but
S0588	so how dare he do that in a
S0590	the golden rule about teach be you never compare one pupil with a sibling
S0588	he doesn't even know you you know
S0616	to a to a sibling no
S0588	but the whole
S0616	no
S0590	yeah
S0588	attitude of just
S0590	or any time you know even sort of
S0616	yeah
S0590	five years into the course
S0588	that's very rude isn't it it's get no respect if someone just
S0590	yeah
S0588	point at you
S0590	yeah
S0588	and say that
S0590	yeah
S0588	that's that's terrible
S0616	yeah it be it be go whereas like you know i have a a yes we'd get i must admit it be the teachers cos i i have a lovely geography teacher
S0588	yeah yeah
S0616	even though geography be a
S0588	yeah
S0616	it be the only only erm o level i get actually be geography
S0590	really
S0588	mm
S0590	yeah
S0616	but the all the rest be cses you know
S0590	yeah yeah
S0616	or gcse or whatever they be call then
S0590	yes yes it will be cses as oppose to
S0616	cses it be
S0590	gces
S0616	yeah
S0588	mm
S0590	yeah
S0616	and geography and and it be like you know it be quite a high grade but it be a b or something i dunno i remember
S0590	yes yes yeah
S0616	but it be because
S0588	and it be because the teacher be good
S0616	i love the teacher

S0616	at all but she be really good
S0588	oh it's rubbish isn't it really
S0590	yeah

S0590	yes yeah
S0616	it be like you know you'd have project and things and
S0590	yeah
S0616	and she think it be worthwhile and
S0588	as for be interest in
S0590	well the trouble be
S0588	if you're interest that should be enough even if
S0590	mm
S0616	yeah
S0588	you're fall down on one side of it almost should be compensate by the fact that you're love it and you're fascinate by it
S0589	so four five six
S0616	indeed indeed
S0588	so it should be okay
S0590	yeah but the thing be
S0588	even if
S0590	i'm afraid that school

S0590	and then he's come up with a
S0588	and then it's like
S0588	can i submit this audio because there's an awful lot of gap and not much talk and then someone would say something like some obscure word or something well they haven't send it back then i transcribe it so

S0616	just the front garden
S0588	do you want to plant something in it
S0589	it's be moot
S0616	i just say that yeah
S0588	yes
S0589	and no
S0589	good riddance
S0616	yeah go straight to the tip
S0588	but then if you know all the sort of stuff that you know you're never really without work so it's brilliant really i mean everyone need the sort of thing that you can do do
S0616	indeed
S0588	mm
S0616	yeah no i've get
S0588	so it's really useful to have
S0616	yeah
S0588	those skills and obviously someone teach you life skills
S0616	i suppose so
S0588	proper skills not useless skills
S0616	well erm well i dunno you get i wonder if it's i find a lot of it be er need must do do do you know what i and i think well
S0588	what do that what do that mean you need must
S0616	well sometimes you think well
S0590	i've get pathetic letter now
S0589	i've get vowels here
S0590	yeah two three four oh five wait a minute
S0616	in in let's say in in the world of of tradesmen there's so many cowboys and people who just wanna rip you off
S0588	yeah
S0616	just take the money think you don't know better
S0588	yeah
S0616	and it really really
S0588	it really upset you
S0616	yeah it do
S0588	that that be the case
S0616	it do that be the case
S0588	yeah
S0616	and it's wrong
S0588	well because that be it be so morally wrong isn't it and
S0616	yes
S0588	like if i be on my own and i didn't have i'd just be rip off leave right and i have not a clue so
S0616	no
S0588	they can just
S0616	yeah it's
S0588	do that can't they
S0616	no exactly
S0588	just it's a
S0616	and i'm not say that that you know there be ways of of like pull up the right tradesmen and things so
S0588	mm
S0616	i think a lot of it be to do with with that you know a lot of it in my experience be like well i'm not pay somebody to rip me off
S0589	thirteen mama
S0588	mm uhu
S0616	i would rather if it take me twice as long i don't care
S0588	you're in control of it
S0616	but at least
S0588	you know the job's be do
S0616	i know it's be do
S0588	yeah
S0616	so if i make a mistake i'll learn more
S0590	be you zig
S0589	no
S0590	well unfortunately you we around alo ago i be lead and then it two nine two two eight seven you're now three 0 five still gonna win because you know i there's nothing i can get with these i don't know if i can even
S0589	do you get a vowel
S0590	no i don't think i can
S0589	what have you get
S0590	a u and an i yeah i don't think it can go anywhere well i i can presumably go somewhere let's er this be my turn after which i can't go at all so let me just see erm i don't think i can even put an i no i i a u er well i could have get six put here well i get six seven put there well that one oh no oh yeah i could have get more but i would have get be leave with some no i think that's it finish so i can't go anywhere so the end score be you've get three 0 five and i've get
S0589	do you still minus yeah
S0590	yeah no no because we didn't finish
S0589	yeah but then it just come off your own score and it doesn't get add to anyone else's score
S0590	oh do it be that so oh right so you you get three 0 four and i get two eight five so that's er er yeah you see your two last well you score twenty six and i score five
S0589	there you go dear
S0590	you see because you score thirty nine point five and then you score thirteen
S0589	then again another go
S0590	and i couldn't score at all
S0589	well thank you dear
S0590	well well that that be a challenge game and actually we be close and change
S0588	yeah
S0616	cos that's how it's
S0588	and that be better than be at the mercy of something
S0616	yeah
S0588	yeah and that's that's the attitude to take really but i do know that thing of if you want it do well you have to do it yourself even though it's take bloody age
S0616	no i know like yeah
S0588	you know it's like that with music as well
S0616	no no i
S0588	but er yeah
S0616	and i suppose that's the other thing isn't it it's better to be patient
S0588	yeah
S0616	well
S0588	yeah you can get
S0616	that's the other thing
S0588	yeah
S0616	cos you know cos then you if it's do well you know you haven't get to go back to it and touch it again
S0588	yes
S0616	and you could appreciate it
S0588	yeah and you know it from the inside out
S0616	and also there's a sense of that you've do it yourself
S0588	mm
S0616	so you take more pride in it
S0588	mm
S0616	and you go well you know
S0588	yeah
S0616	i do that look
S0588	yeah
S0616	it's still there
S0588	well that's very fundamental a a fundamental sort of approach to life really if you like
S0616	but i i i really think that anybody can
S0588	i'm sure they can it's just there's this mystery
S0616	yes oh i mean like if you want you know i reckon oh can
S0588	yeah yeah
S0616	it's just the
S0588	it's just but
S0616	know
S0588	it's what someone
S0616	and have and have the confidence
S0588	and what you're expose to in life your influence so if your dad expose you to all this
S0616	mm
S0588	then or my mum expose me to sew so it's just on your radar so you

S0588	i like roast vegetables
S0590	why don't you just shove them in with the roast then
S0588	all roast vegetables
S0589	er because that compromise your gravy because there's too much water content in a carrot
S0590	so darling no you could put
S0590	them in a different dish

S0590	aye
S0590	mm
S0588	the truro
S0590	what be that
S0588	we've get the truro
S0616	oh cornish
S0588	range
S0590	oh be that
S0588	our toilet
S0590	be that what you've get
S0588	yeah
S0616	cornish toilet
S0588	yes
S0590	yeah but it's nice
S0588	be to truro
S0590	and you see yes it it bypass the window frame which i think be a nice
S0588	there be a bite of wallpaper behind the tile wasn't there
S0616	be there
S0588	yes
S0616	oh right the the history
S0588	yeah
S0590	behind the tile up there
S0588	yeah
S0590	be there
S0588	mm
S0590	well of course it use to be presumably it use to be a bedroom
S0588	a bedroom
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0616	probably
S0590	yeah
S0589	i've use the loo
S0588	and which flush do you use
S0589	well actually they're the same size both button
S0616	they're not
S0588	well they're
S0616	they're not the same size
S0588	no but
S0589	well then it's a fine line
S0588	it's a very fine line
S0616	it be a fine line
S0590	what do you say
S0616	it be a fine line
S0588	but one be
S0590	it's a same what
S0588	like that one's concave one's convex in well not that way but in shape
S0589	i think you'd need a mathematician just to
S0616	no well no if you look at
S0588	so
S0589	to prove
S0616	well one be more
S0588	no
S0616	of a crescent moon shape
S0588	yeah
S0616	and the other one be slightly smaller it
S0589	but it's difficult
S0588	the one
S0616	anyway
S0588	that stick out be
S0589	er the next challenge for me be
S0588	big flush
S0589	i will try and recreate the original window frame
S0588	how will you do that
S0589	it get chop up
S0616	no no indeed those look a bite odd
S0589	yeah
S0616	yeah just a bite of architrave to just patch it in
S0589	yeah
S0616	erm we be chat i be chat to your mum when we be up there in the bathroom
S0590	as one be
S0589	as you do
S0588	admire the toilet
S0616	when when you get round to it you know to sort out your consider reduce the size of the window
S0590	so that the basin
S0616	just bring it up so that you could bring your sink in underneath the window
S0589	where there's already a water supply
S0616	well that
S0590	yeah
S0616	doesn't matter
S0590	yeah
S0616	about that but it just mean it free up more wall space for everything else cos er that window's really low and actually it's quite i think it's quite dangerous cos it's so low it's like at knee level
S0590	yeah
S0616	you could easily trip and fall out of the
S0616	do you know what i mean whereas
S0588	i imagine
S0590	well er
S0588	do that
S0590	but also actually
S0588	do it i've just get a vision
S0590	but if if the if the blind be up you're absolutely at expose level as well actually
S0616	well well indeed yeah and you don't need
S0590	you know
S0588	yeah
S0616	you don't you just need a good
S0590	you could do without that
S0588	hello
S0590	yeah exactly
S0589	well what i'd like to do be move the bathroom
S0588	hello
S0589	just
S0590	full frontal view
S0588	hello
S0616	mm
S0589	and then i'd turn that room into the spare bedroom and it would be a double room
S0590	mm mm mm
S0589	yeah
S0588	you get an uhu from
S0590	oh no er no i'm just hear what you're say you'd change the bedroom into the bathroom so you have the bathroom above the kitchen if you change the kitchen as well yeah
S0589	yeah i suppose so
S0590	yeah
S0616	mm
S0589	cos then both spare room would be just either end of the house both bedrooms
S0590	yeah
S0616	i suppose you've get that break between bedrooms and it's kind of share oh well i can see where you're come from there but
S0590	yeah well i i
S0588	yeah
S0590	you're you're think that the the bathroom would more more easily accommodate double bed and wardrobes and things than
S0589	yeah and since it's an arbitrary choice anyway where you put the bath when you move it upstairs and you lose a bedroom i don't know why they choose
S0588	that one
S0589	you know a nice rear face large room when there be a small
S0588	less yeah true
S0589	interconnect room
S0588	cos that's probably a nicer
S0590	it's not
S0588	room for a bedroom
S0590	interconnect really
S0589	i mean between
S0590	yeah yeah right yeah
S0616	probably
S0590	but remember you want to make it into two room anyway
S0616	probably something to do with the waste
S0590	yeah
S0616	maybe maybe
S0590	yeah
S0616	get access to the drain cos that's
S0590	yeah
S0616	the nearest point
S0590	that's
S0589	that it's it's just drop
S0616	you
S0589	straight down yeah but you've get gravity in your on your side haven't you
S0616	oh indeed yeah
S0590	yeah
S0616	yeah you can run it down the house
S0589	as long as it's not the front room
S0616	yeah
S0588	but interest what you be say about get rid of the chimney breast cos i be sort of look at the
S0590	yes yeah
S0588	i be look at the din room and kind of go how much more yeah there would be quite a lot more room it would seem like quite a big space
S0590	oh i i think
S0589	it's not that breast darling it's that it's it's
S0588	you know try to cover it cover up the chimney
S0589	not that one
S0588	i think it be that one
S0589	no it would be it's the one in the bathroom the back of the house
S0588	no no
S0590	no no but no but
S0616	no no we be talk about it
S0590	talk about no we be talk about
S0589	oh you mean separately
S0590	earlier on about move
S0616	yeah
S0590	probably when you be watch the rugby
S0589	yeah no i'd like to because i don't we're never gonna use
S0588	but i mean look at the
S0590	either fireplace
S0588	room it's kind of silly to
S0589	either fireplace on that side side
S0588	just have that stick out
S0589	hello shut the door
S0590	yeah yeah yeah
S0588	without well either have a fireplace and have it utilise
S0590	yeah
S0588	as a chimney
S0590	but then it's not big enough to because
S0588	or
S0590	your your table be too near there
S0588	oh we we wouldn't want
S0590	in there
S0588	that anyway
S0590	yeah
S0589	cos we don't need one in either of the room that that
S0588	but i just think as a principle in the house either have a function
S0590	fireplace
S0588	sticky out thing
S0590	or not have it at all
S0588	fireplace or not have it so
S0589	mm
S0590	yeah
S0588	it make sense to not have that definitely but then i think what be go on my office
S0589	but it would open up all the space in your office too
S0590	well it wouldn't because that would
S0588	well
S0590	stay as it be
S0588	would it though
S0589	no cos it would
S0588	this be what i'm
S0590	hey but listen
S0590	well a move a you know you know move any floor off a weight support area you have to put rsjs in er on each
S0589	it's not it's not the floor though be it
S0590	and every floor
S0589	it's it's just you take the chimney that's run down there plus the the other bit's just infill for some reason
S0588	then why why be that so
S0590	no no no
S0588	such a strange
S0590	i think we'll leave the study as it be cos you you look at that anyway yeah
S0588	mm
S0590	i mean that's the foundations of the house really cos oh
S0616	mm i don't know how it work down there
S0590	yeah
S0616	cos you're on a hill so
S0590	yeah
S0616	there's a lot more
S0590	well it's
S0616	go on
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0590	it's dig into the hill
S0616	so i i don't really know
S0590	yeah
S0616	but if you be think about take the chimneys out i would start
S0590	on the bedroom
S0616	well you you'd get into the loft
S0590	yeah
S0616	and and do the necessary rsjs and support work in the loft
S0590	yeah
S0616	to hold up what's above the roof
S0590	yeah
S0616	then you can just take out the bedroom you can take out
S0590	oh really you don't need a an rsj each and every place
S0616	no there's no just
S0590	no because you're only support what's above there
S0589	no there will only
S0616	you cos you you you
S0590	you've support what's
S0616	hold up what
S0590	still to be
S0616	exactly
S0590	support
S0616	what need to be there
S0590	yeah
S0616	and you just take out
S0590	yeah
S0589	you're remove
S0590	yeah
S0616	then you just take out
S0590	that's right yes yes
S0616	out out from underneath of it
S0589	from under it
S0590	yeah yeah
S0616	and make good so but it's obviously it er it's not just take the brickwork out though that's the other thing be that once you've take it out cos obviously the joists the floor joists that run only to that point
S0590	yeah
S0616	need to be
S0590	extend
S0616	extend
S0590	yeah
S0616	and do properly not just
S0590	and into the wall
S0616	exactly
S0590	yeah yeah
S0616	it need to go into the wall
S0590	yeah
S0616	and so
S0590	yeah
S0588	right
S0616	once you've take that away you need to put a support in to hold up the rest of your ceilings you know so
S0590	yeah yes
S0588	yeah
S0590	i mean it's a major job
S0588	change one thing and then something you know it's
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0616	it's like a knock on all the time
S0588	yeah
S0616	you have to
S0588	yeah yeah
S0616	go like right
S0588	yeah
S0616	but if you start from the top it's easier because
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0616	you've get you haven't get to support every section
S0590	no
S0616	if you know what i mean
S0590	no yeah
S0588	mm not like cos next door say that the previous owners just get like a
S0590	a hammer and knock out
S0588	a hammer and just knock a hole for the patio doors without put any support up or anything like that and
S0590	and it be who stop them
S0588	and he's a builder so he say er erm your house be gonna fall down if you carry on so
S0590	mm mm
S0588	he help sort of put construct whatever it be that they call it to er
S0590	an rsj to
S0588	yes
S0616	yeah yeah run support and er
S0588	yeah
S0616	oh right

S0588	oh
S0590	actually that be
S0588	that's really sad
S0590	a the do you know this
S0588	terrible story
S0590	and very rarely very rarely mention this woman be call this be when they be in their twenties
S0588	yeah
S0590	and erm this therefore mean fifty years ago
S0616	mm
S0590	and erm be take ill go into hospital be visit her in hospital and then go in one day day and have actually deteriorate rapidly suddenly and die
S0588	ah
S0590	but of course be no relative
S0588	no
S0590	so she be
S0588	and couldn't have a
S0590	she
S0588	civil partnership or anything
S0590	no no oh no i mean
S0588	no
S0590	she be unrecognised
S0588	so
S0590	you know
S0588	yeah
S0590	she be you know and so
S0588	that's awful
S0590	she be just sweep aside and she didn't know what be go on with and i mean
S0588	and all the next of kin be the family
S0590	she be completely distraught and we'd actually the these two that well that one and his sister be small tot we'd just get down to which mean pile two small children into a car with two adults etcetera etcetera we'd just unpack we get this distraught call from
S0588	ah
S0590	up in so we have to pile everything back in and get get back up and sort of rescue her but you know it
S0588	be she live with her
S0590	you know she be just
S0588	and everything
S0590	oh yeah they be yes
S0588	yeah
S0590	they they be live in a flat together
S0588	but so therefore
S0590	and she's actually never really
S0588	but do her family the family of the partner not
S0590	oh yes
S0588	acknowledge didn't acknowledge her at all
S0590	oh yes they do
S0588	oh they do
S0590	yes they do actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	they they acknowledge er but of course they weren't there at the time because you know have just
S0588	mm
S0590	suddenly deteriorate and die be
S0588	yeah
S0590	the only one be there erm and they say
S0588	that's why that's
S0590	we're get in touch with the next of kin push off sort of thing
S0588	that's where the civil partnership come in
S0590	you know
S0616	mm
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	cos otherwise
S0590	yeah
S0588	there's no recognition
S0590	yeah
S0588	in any way

S0590	that these
S0588	for fifty years
S0590	yeah yes
S0588	for example
S0590	yes yes
S0588	and then
S0590	yeah
S0588	there would be under the law no
S0590	yeah but i think even if
S0588	recognition
S0590	if if i mean you and and and indeed you and be recognise as partner you know
S0588	mm just because we happen to be
S0590	whether you have a piece of paper or not
S0588	heterosexual yeah
S0590	to say so
S0616	mm
S0588	that's right
S0590	you know so it's acknowledge that
