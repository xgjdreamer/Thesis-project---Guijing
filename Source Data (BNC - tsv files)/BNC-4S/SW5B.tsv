S0104	well when you see her on erm the competition that she get into girls aloud
S0374	popstars
S0104	popstars
S0376	popstars weren't it yeah
S0104	she be a average look girl
S0376	just another teenager
S0104	she be nothing special
S0376	yeah
S0104	yeah she wasn't ugly
S0376	mm
S0104	but she wasn't a rave beauty
S0376	mm
S0104	so it just show what a little bite of money and a few treatments can do
S0376	oh yeah
S0374	there be an article in the daily mail today you know sam smith
S0376	yeah
S0374	how in his brit speech he say about how he's put on weight and he be like all happy apparently he's just lose fourteen pound in fourteen days that's water work that's water retention mostly he's lose cos he be quite
S0376	yeah
S0374	bloat
S0374	but he's follow this new erm cos she be something to do with the prime minister tony blair or something i dunno her new diet book plan thing
S0104	cherie blair
S0374	er no she be like an assistant
S0104	oh
S0374	lady i can't remember her name i saw it on the radio but erm be it the blair or cameron er she be something to do with an mp a pm sorry
S0374	but erm i be gonna say what oh yeah
S0374	but erm yeah and you can see he he's lose load of weight but i don't think it be in
S0104	mm
S0374	fourteen days though because he be look slimmer at the brits than he be from the grammys in november so he have lose a bite since then
S0104	mm
S0374	but apparently yeah two stone in two weeks
S0376	yeah
S0104	but i don't think that's a healthy loss
S0374	no exactly you can't maintain that
S0104	no
S0376	that's the thing you see
S0104	mm
S0376	as i say the slower you lose it
S0104	yeah
S0376	if you lose it and then you're more likely to keep it off
S0374	yeah
S0376	than this sudden weight
S0374	but even now
S0104	yeah
S0376	gain
S0374	i know we
S0376	or weight loss
S0374	like we have a
S0376	and you gain it just a quick
S0374	bad weekend but like to only put on two pound
S0104	yeah
S0376	yeah
S0374	that's a good thing but yeah sort of oh i always dread go in and be like i'm gonna put on five pound or something
S0104	mm
S0374	but really it's you if we've lose it before you can lose it again
S0376	mm
S0374	and i i shouldn't worry because while i've have bad weeks and i've go in and like over christmas i eat terribly i put three pound on
S0104	mm
S0374	over christmas it's
S0104	yeah
S0374	mm
S0104	no i i i think it's erm better to lose it slowly
S0376	mm
S0104	cos whatever you do to lose two stone in a fortnight be pretty radical
S0376	it's drastic yeah
S0104	i don't know what he's do but that's something pretty radical
S0376	and you can't maintain that
S0104	and you can't maintain that kind of
S0374	no cos
S0376	can you
S0104	diet
S0374	as soon as you then go back to try to eat semi normally
S0104	yeah yeah
S0374	your body's gonna be in shock and won't be
S0376	mm
S0104	yeah exactly any fad diet can't be maintain
S0376	no
S0104	it's you've just get to eat
S0374	that's the thing you like
S0376	you've get to be sensible haven't you i mean
S0374	but then say
S0104	mm
S0374	this lady i read some of the key point of her erm approach be you can't call foods good or bad foods or treat because then you crave the bad foods because you're not suppose to have them food be food if you everything in moderation like what she be say be sensible so that's why i be sort of look it's sort of like a slimming worldy sort of thing it sound like
S0104	mm
S0374	erm but she's whereas they say you can have unlimited pasta she's obviously say like you shouldn't eat massive meals you should eat sort of smaller portion
S0104	mm
S0374	and not snack if you're gonna have something have er something that's semi substantial that's gonna tide you over a bite longer as oppose to like a biscuit or something
S0104	mm
S0374	but erm so it be all quite sensible stuff so that's why i'm think it probably be where he's be to all these party and stuff
S0104	mm
S0374	and drink alcohol he's probably retain all this water
S0104	mm
S0374	then he's think i'm gonna start eat sort of sensible food and he he that's where he's lose it it's in water retention but erm
S0104	mm mm
S0374	but then say that the second week of slimming world like how i can't remember how
S0104	you lose four pound in the second week didn't you
S0374	yeah so that be so that be basically probably the similar thing it be just sort of water and
S0104	yeah
S0374	other stuff but
S0376	mm
S0104	mm that's about a stone not two stone isn't it fourteen pound what be i talk about a stone in a fortnight
S0374	yeah so
S0104	but even so that's still a lot
S0376	i need to do that would be good wouldn't it a whole month three stone
S0376	a month two stone yeah er oh and then i'd be there
S0104	yeah
S0104	but then you'd have to stay there that's the thing
S0376	yeah
S0374	do it gradually
S0376	i know it's the gradual malarkey's get bore
S0374	well you've get a competition with your sister now
S0104	yeah
S0374	yeah that's right
S0104	that's what you need you need you need a
S0376	yeah
S0104	a sort of aim you when you first start it's all keen and you're fire up but you do gradually lose that so you
S0374	yeah
S0104	a competition with would be really good that's go all red on the yeah on the
S0376	it go
S0104	yeah
S0376	yeah oh go to work tomorrow
S0104	i'm not
S0104	i haven't have a holiday since i can't remember the last holiday october i think

S0104	but 's do monday night
S0376	be she
S0104	yeah apparently she's very up for swap and do the odd extra thing so that's good news cos i could do sometimes it would be good to have a swap partner
S0376	mm yeah
S0374	yeah and mum also i've get to pay out fifty two quid to have another dbs check
S0376	have you
S0104	oh
S0374	yeah because i'm already work as the thing it's so apparently that you can go to any this be it's one
S0104	mm
S0374	that will allow me to go into all the different school i've get to go in to
S0104	oh right
S0374	do my train but i've already get one
S0104	yeah
S0374	i already work in a school with kid
S0374	why have i get to spend out and so it's fifty two quid on this dbs i've get to have the medical the health questionnaire that i've get to pay the doctor which be about probably about thirty quid for the
S0376	yeah
S0374	doctor to do
S0104	mm
S0374	so i've get to spend out and er pay for my application nineteen quid so in all it's cost me about a hundred it's gonna cost me about a hundred just over a hundred quid just to apply to be a bloody teacher
S0376	mm
S0374	crazy
S0376	mm
S0104	yeah this dbs though i mean what do they do on that check to so you can go to all the different school
S0374	yeah i know
S0104	that they do all they've get to do be find out if you've get a criminal record well they know you haven't get a criminal record because you've get a dbs check
S0374	yeah i don't know
S0104	i suppose for you know those renewals at least the renewals be pay for but didn't they
S0376	oh well i
S0374	i'd understand if i be work say
S0376	its show it's charge but it's not work
S0374	with vulnerable like if my dbs be from like work with
S0104	yeah
S0374	vulnerable adults
S0104	yeah
S0374	and then go to children but mine be do to work in the school
S0104	do you have one for when you come to
S0374	no they just take my one from the school
S0104	oh do they
S0374	yeah they photocopy that
S0104	because you never they they they always pay for cls what's the difference between dbs and crb
S0374	yeah that's the thing i've get a crb at the school which i then carry over but it's
S0104	what's a dbs then
S0374	i have no it's basically the same thing but i just think it's
S0104	oh
S0374	maybe a bite more broader
S0104	cos they they all
S0374	that's probably why
S0104	the always pay for your crb check for people who be
S0376	yeah
S0374	oh
S0104	start work there don't they
S0374	no they just photocopy my one from the school because like you say it's just to check i haven't get a criminal record
S0104	yeah

S0104	yeah
S0374	whether it's work with kid or with vulnerable adults

S0167	i'd rather have the job
S0104	yeah
S0167	if like this be my only option i would take it but see as like have an interest in me
S0104	mm
S0167	i'd rather even if it's at first not as much money or not as much security or not as many hours i'd rather
S0104	yeah
S0167	just cultivate that rather than
S0104	yeah
S0167	take a job
S0104	no i can understand that
S0167	i'm not that keen on
S0104	i can understand that but you know

S0167	well he say the next couple of days and
S0104	what either way they'd contact you
S0167	he he didn't say
S0104	no
S0167	erm he just say the next couple of days so i assume he mean either way
S0104	mm
S0167	erm and so he hasn't contact me so i'm guess not may
S0104	do you mention erm at all when you be
S0167	no we didn't go through half of the interview oh next question how's
S0104	well
S0104	i just wonder when he be do the sort of friendly chit chat
S0167	no he didn't talk about i think that would be a bite of a sore point
S0104	ah be he heartbroken by
S0167	apparently so yeah
S0104	oh do she feel guilty
S0167	erm well i dunno it happen quite a long time ago it be in about kind of august last year
S0104	yeah
S0167	i think she just get feed up with it
S0104	eh
S0167	i think she just get feed up
S0104	what with him or with something
S0167	apparently he be just so obsess with football all he would do be watch it play it or talk about it
S0104	oh
S0167	and then they keep have chat about you know you've really get to you know stop be so obsess with football and erm he keep say oh yeah yeah i'll i'll change and i'll i'll spend more time at home and blah blah blah and he just never do so in the end she just get feed up with it so she just leave
S0104	mm well if she'd if she'd tell him and warn him
S0167	well yeah apparently they have have lot of chat and she say she couldn't bear to go through it again and she know that all would happen be that
S0104	mm
S0167	he'd say oh i'll change and they'd be so that's why she just do it the way she do
S0104	mm well can't blame her can't blame her i mean
S0167	so
S0104	in that case what's that can you hear water
S0167	no i can kind of hear a buzz which i think could be construe as water
S0104	sound as though that it's absolutely suddenly pour down with rain which it's not
S0167	no i can see i hear what you mean be water but i don't think it sound like water really
S0104	mm
S0167	that much
S0104	well all i can say be if they do offer you this job at 's place if it's really not what you want then that's what i say yesterday don't settle for something that you don't want you know
S0167	well it's not it's not like
S0167	well well it's not like something i'm would really dread do
S0104	mm

S0104	oh i haven't see that for age there's two be you watch it with me when those two lads win eleven thousand pound
S0167	no i want eleven thousand pound
S0104	yeah but it total about up to eleven thousand and they the first round er i can't remember what it be now but they say well we don't really know much about it but they say well we'll take a stab at such and such and they get like hardly hardly any point you know and write down
S0167	yeah
S0104	and then they seem to sort of fluke it all the way through just wing it
S0167	oh that's lucky yeah there be a man on tip point the other day and he just didn't know any of the answer but he be just go oh i'll give it a guess
S0104	yeah
S0167	and he keep get the guess right and he almost get the jackpot it be right on the edge
S0104	oh
S0167	he almost get that out er erm but then he use up all his things
S0104	mm
S0167	and he say do you want to do the final one you know where the jackpot's worth
S0104	yeah
S0167	the only one that's worth and he be like no i'll just stick with my
S0104	oh it be on the
S0167	two thousand
S0104	very edge
S0167	it be right so it wasn't actually teeter over but it be right on the edge

S0167	so if he'd get a good erm a well place thing
S0104	they do it when they do the
S0167	they didn't they didn't do it
S0104	oh but they usually do a thing at the end
S0167	well they didn't do that that's what i think they should do that cos that
S0104	well they do usually
S0167	well i don't know why they didn't do that they just
S0104	oh
S0167	didn't do it he go oh well here he be three thousand pound
S0104	oh that's odd
