S0570	mm
S0517	the map be blue and orange yellow i think
S0571	yellow
S0517	yellow so the yellow be the people that vote remain and blue be leave and yellow be scotland northern ireland and london
S0571	and it be just tiny areas
S0517	and the rest of the country be blue
S0571	the whole whole of the
S0517	but obviously london's huge the population there
S0571	it's get a huge population
S0517	so scotland northern ireland and london vote to stay the rest of the country want to leave and the people in cos i didn't understand why but the people in london that's where the head offices be for a lot of european company and bank and things and they're all think that they might lose their job because those company might now move their head offices
S0571	yeah you
S0517	to other
S0570	doesn't a lot so much trade go through london

S0571	well we could trade with them
S0517	we can
S0571	there there be just tax that be impose the idea be it's quite interest really cos the the that be part of the economic discussion that if we leave the eu we will we would er put ourselves at a disadvantage to trade with that market those x amount of countries
S0572	yeah
S0571	erm however there's big opportunities with america canada new zealand australia
S0572	china

S0572	oh yeah the younger
S0571	on the older market er er

S0570	yeah it seem so
S0571	do you know that
S0517	have you google it
S0571	and it
S0572	send me a link on this thing that
S0571	why don't you ask erm and erm

S0571	who
S0572	well it's
S0571	do you know either of them
S0572	well i don't see them no
S0571	why don't you go and knock on 's door one day and see if he's in and just ask him
S0572	well i speak to like a few weeks ago and
S0571	
S0572	yeah as cos he score for me on football manager so i send him picture and
S0571	do you
S0572	he be our top goal scorer he score like five goals and i be play him centre mid like three game i be like what fair play
S0571	so you can obviously you know well why don't you just message him and ask him
S0517	yeah
S0570	if i be on football manager i'd play myself on every game
S0572	yeah i do his first time he be play
S0570	no i'd play myself if i be on football manager
S0517	that's good isn't it to be on football manager
S0570	yeah
S0517	like he's do well he's do really well
S0571	do you think he'll make do you reckon he'll make
S0572	yeah
S0571	first team
S0572	well the thing can er do you know when you just hit
S0572	and it say hot and you have
S0571	hot prospect
S0572	yeah and you have three one one's better than the two others he be the better one so
S0570	usually they scout off football manager don't they
S0571	i don't know
S0517	do they
S0570	don't some don't some of those guy use football manager
S0571	i i don't know they be they'll go and look at them from it maybe i don't know but you you should message him and see whether how how he get into that because there must be there's a there's a chap who work for me and his son erm go to an arsenal academy
S0572	be he any good
S0571	i don't know cos i've never meet his son but erm he's get er i think arsenal have get about five or six academies throughout the country erm so he his son's be scout for that but he doesn't think he'll make it
S0570	i suppose if you can go to academy
S0517	where's that
S0570	it's like a football academy which be expensive
S0571	you have to pay for it don't you
S0570	yeah if you er it's like
S0571	well i don't know
S0517	who's who be
S0570	this guy that make the academy
S0517	oh he's not a footballer
S0571	no but every apparently what say be that he he pick people you pay to go there but all the scout go there because
S0517	mm
S0571	he's get the contact but my view be if you're good enough
S0517	you'd have be scout
S0571	you'll get scout or you'll go to a trial and somebody will pick you up at a trial so
S0572	i never perform well in trials
S0570	do you get nervous
S0572	that's right
S0571	yeah well you if you i don't think you've ever play in the right position have you
S0572	well i've start play centre mid at the start of didn't i i have
S0571	yeah but you weren't anywhere near the player you be now
S0572	mm
S0571	you play centre mid at
S0572	with no one next to me
S0571	well it didn't help that you have no one next to you
S0570	do you show dad that picture
S0572	yeah
S0517	which picture
S0572	me and
S0570	no the other one where you're go like that
S0572	oh yeah yeah
S0571	but you didn't help that when you play for
S0571	would take the off
S0572	me
S0571	would take off
S0572	and me
S0571	and leave you on
S0572	oh
S0571	and you be the only person who could kick a ball that be leave on the pitch
S0572	i could remember me me come off every time and then there be set players
S0570	what
S0571	yeah
S0570	be you try to say you don't
S0572	no but i'm just say every time i go off they score straightaway
S0571	but that's because all the players the the only players that could play be put on the pitch at the same
S0517	mm
S0571	same time and then when when they have to rest people he take everyone off apart from you and and which mean that you end up have to cover a lot of grind i don't think you be as quick then i think you've get a gain a bite of pace
S0517	yeah you be quick these days
S0570	you need to play the again and beat them
S0571	oh
S0517	what when 's play for them
S0572	they've move they've move league
S0517	oh have they where to
S0571	i know but you might play a friendly against them you should ask frank
S0572	i wanna play at cos they've get some of the players and they've get play for them cos they get junior
S0570	and you should ask to play the just so like
S0570	you can rock up and beat them
S0571	mm
S0517	i've have quite a lot but yes
S0571	you should ask to i think you should try and play because i think
S0570	dad just want to er be like you and dad and
S0572	no he just want to
S0572	tea of erm
S0517	yeah yeah he's just there for the teas
S0571	well no i i just think have make a huge mistake for for for because
S0572	and then make the the choice or do
S0571	i think make the choice
S0517	i think it be both i don't think try to talk him out of it
S0571	i think say i think be very critical about his football and say that he wasn't the the player that he be erm and apparently he go and play for and all of a sudden he be run to take free kick he be run to take throw ins and all the rest of it but the problem there be that he hasn't get the quality of players next to him so if you've get one eye you know put play next to to you with one leg as well
S0571	which be what be then you know yes if
S0571	you've get two legs and two eye and you can actually kick a ball half straight
S0517	you're gonna look good
S0571	you get you you you get to do everything
S0570	just play on one side of the centre back as well
S0571	with one eye
S0570	he have to play on like one of the side
S0517	oh that's really really mean
S0517	yeah but that's really mean
S0572	yeah but you should go the other side
S0570	no he doesn't take it to heart at all like he laugh
S0571	do you tell him he smelt too
S0570	no not no sometimes
S0571	sometimes
S0517	ah
S0571	so yes you do erm but yeah i i think
S0572	i wanna go to
S0517	why
S0571	why would you wanna go to
S0572	just so
S0571	they've get an academy
S0572	have they
S0570	you don't you could go to 's academy
S0571	he wouldn't go to 's academy if you're gonna play an academy football you wanna go to
S0570	you just say you'd go to you'd go to over
S0517	he didn't no he say that
S0571	he say that i say
S0517	dad didn't
S0571	you wanna if if you're gonna go to an academy you'd go to
S0570	like
S0570	something like that
S0571	because then there's a chance that you could actually pick up a semi pro contract or even a pro contract
S0572	well in the championships here it would be pro wouldn't it
S0571	well you might not get a contract with them but you'd get a contract with maybe or maybe er
S0572	i don't wanna play there cos of the and ever since i be a young age
S0572	no
S0570	i saw when have his er villa trial they tell him to come back in six months to reassess his game but they say you should move on from and go and train at
S0517	oh do they
S0570	yeah
S0517	what's he do now
S0570	he's
S0572	er
S0570	he's still he's at
S0571	he get injure didn't he
S0570	yeah
S0517	oh
S0570	so he's still go to his trial for villa
S0571	but i think i i i think for you if if if you have a good season this season you could do quite well
S0517	if you wanna yeah if you wanna go for the academy and do your a level there that would be okay
S0570	so long as you sort your football career out and be asian

S0517	be a an agent

S0517	yeah but what
S0570	we may as well have be play leave hand
S0571	so you don't think and we would beat and
S0570	yeah
S0517	i think
S0571	do we not beat them six love or something
S0517	i think you'd beat them
S0572	something like that
S0570	when we be in the same we beat them six one
S0572	yeah but it's it's not six love be it they get a game
S0517	be that last year you play them
S0571	let's not trash talk them too much
S0571	i don't really wanna have this conversation in two months' you know a week's time
S0571	and for us to have be wipe off the court i think we'll run you close
S0517	you've gotta beat and first
S0571	we have get to beat and
S0517	which er i think you should
S0571	and we should beat them shouldn't we
S0570	and we've gotta beat and if 's
S0517	oh that's a tough one
S0570	if there's one pair that doesn't wanna lose to in this whole competition
S0517	it's you and
S0570	it will be me and er me and yes
S0517	yes
S0571	i think you could beat them
S0517	if you don't play on
S0570	i don't know it's
S0517	at all
S0570	's a bad player
S0517	no i know but he's not as
S0571	it doesn't matter
S0517	he's not in the same league as be he
S0570	no
S0517	so
S0571	can he put the ball away cos the
S0570	
S0571	the problem they have last last night be the other guy be alright but could not put the ball away so every volley yes he could make a volley
S0570	it at least it depend on how well dominate the court
S0517	the problem with be
S0570	that leave him that's how well that's what'll happen
S0517	the problem be he can get to everything and he can intercept if he want can't he
S0571	well yeah but you can lob him cos he's get no legs
S0570	he will retrieve
S0517	he's really quick
S0571	yeah he can retrieve it but then he's not at the net
S0517	but he would be he's very quick
S0570	we we won't hit a ball to him
S0517	you've just gotta try and not no you can't hit
S0571	pardon
S0570	we we're not gonna hit one ball to him like we we're gonna wind him up as much as we can in that
S0571	absolutely so you should
S0517	mm it's the only way to do it
S0570	if even the guy's at the net we're gonna make it very clear that be not get the
S0571	and er if i be you and
S0517	yeah
S0571	i would hit the ball full blood at his partner
S0571	absolutely
S0572	do what no do cos on the first second serve will just hit the ball as hard as he can at the net player so watch out for 's second serve
S0571	mm he won't do that with you he won't do that with you
S0517	why not
S0571	no
S0517	cos he's lose
S0571	cos he no he have a responsibility
S0517	well
S0571	for for them and i don't think i don't as much as he want to win
S0570	he's not stupid
S0571	he's not gonna hit them
S0517	oh hit the ball at them be that what you
S0571	yeah
S0517	oh no i don't think oh
S0570	he do it yesterday
S0571	he doesn't do it to
S0517	not on
S0571	he doesn't coach them
S0517	not i don't think he'd hit no i don't think he'd hit you on purpose
S0571	he wouldn't hit you
S0517	no
S0571	and he wouldn't hit you and i don't think he's hit
S0571	no
S0517	we're hop he wouldn't hit you dad
S0517	tomorrow
S0571	well if he do
S0571	if he do
S0517	if it
S0571	i might go round the other side of the court
S0571	with my racquet
S0517	i think if he hit you he'd be like
S0571	and then he won't be play in the double
S0517	he'd be desperate
S0571	and he won't be yes
S0517	if he have to start hit shots at your body
S0571	absolutely
S0517	he'd be desperate
S0570	he do
S0517	do he
S0570	when he serve if he start do that i mean as i say we'll get
S0517	you have a little grunt tonight
S0572	well i'm sorry but i've just have to play twenty shots in a row and i be get a bite
S0570	quite a lot of the juniors have start to grunt
S0517	really do you think you should stop them
S0570	like me and be the only two juniors that don't grunt
S0571	doesn't grunt that much
S0570	he do when he's
S0517	no
S0570	try that's when you know if he's try or not
S0517	be you conscious of it be you conscious of grunt
S0570	no they're not
S0572	dunno
S0570	obviously not
S0517	no i'm ask
S0571	he doesn't grunt
S0517	wait
S0571	he go er a couple of time
S0517	once or twice er like towards the end of the match be you just get tire
S0572	get a bite i felt tire before the match i be like warm up i actually think my legs be dead
S0570	i i my shoulder hurt
S0571	i have to say be not an easy player to play against be he
S0517	say be like the duracell bunny and he just doesn't stop run
S0571	your mum jump to your defence
S0517	i do i say well he's meet his match in if you're on about duracell bunnies cos he can go and go and go
S0572	i be tire before the match start
S0517	didn't look it though even say he's blow and look fresh as a daisy
S0571	i say that look like he's blow a bite
S0517	you didn't look wear out
S0572	i be sweat
S0570	yeah but that's er that's yeah
S0571	the problem you'd the problem you'd have be 's one proposition and that's the that's the type of player you struggle against at the moment be a completely different different proposition cos he hit at pace
S0572	yeah but the thing be i could hit at pace as well though i've just choose not to
S0571	i understand that i do understand that
S0571	he can't er i i think both those type of players pose different problems for you at the moment so prove if you've get a really reliable player you try and hit the ball harder and harder and you you start make mistake which you didn't play well that day and
S0570	i reckon i've get that in my to do that
S0572	and dad tell me the wrong game plan
S0571	i didn't tell you the wrong plan i talk to about it and he say you play the right game plan and if you don't continue to if you continue to play like that in in six months' time won't be able to live with you on a court it be the right play but unfortunately it didn't work out on the day hit the ball a lot harder
S0570	i mean
S0571	will be a lot more difficult for you
S0571	because you won't have you won't have the time to play those so you've gotta take a couple of years before you'll be a competition for him or i mean you might get a set off them yeah
S0570	but that's mental that's not actually technical like you can listen to every parent like say oh six months' time he's gonna be but say six months' time for like the last three years since he's come to the club
S0572	when i can beat you
S0570	yeah and eventually the day you come to it it'll be like oh a call that like yeah you call it three years ago
S0517	yeah no you're right he's two years ahead of you age wise experience play
S0571	i actually think and and this be be absolutely honest i think you've get great forehand i 's get a better backhand at the moment i think your first serve be pretty much on a par but 's second serve be miles ahead volley you're both on a par you're you're much better on the half volley
S0572	oh yeah i've get a quick reaction to it
S0571	you're better on the half volley
S0572	he's better on
S0571	he he's better at the net but i think you know in two years' time 's gonna have improve massively as well
S0572	yeah but everyone say
S0517	do you think
S0572	everyone say before
S0572	he he improve so much and then even say that he's improve but no one's tell me that i've improve even though i've get a set off him
S0517	you have improve
S0571	you get lot of praise about your tennis
S0572	yeah i know
S0517	you have improve
S0572	i'm just say i'm
S0571	don't give it that
S0572	i'm just say that he
S0571	don't give it that
S0572	i i'm just say
S0517	the thing be
S0571	if everyone everyone stand on the side of the court today tell how you be gonna be you're be wipe his backside very soon
S0572	that's be what say as well
S0571	that's a load of rubbish
S0517	it be rubbish
S0571	it it's a load of er you if you wanna be
S0517	they just say that to wind you up and to
S0571	if you wanna beat if you really wanna beat he play a huge amount and he also play with intensity every time he play he give it a hundred per cent don't give it that
S0570	most of the time i think
S0572	but oh it's alright
S0571	he do and he's get over the
S0517	but what
S0571	mental problems he have
S0517	what i wanna know be
S0571	when he be younger
S0570	i think
S0517	how's it gonna go when we feel like you're ready to you know ditch and take your brother as your double partner
S0570	dunno
S0517	because you know you're just
S0570	it's not gonna happen very often be it
S0571	what do you mean
S0517	no but could you not see those
S0570	it's only gonna happen like
S0517	could you not
S0570	in the tournament
S0517	see the name er your that's exactly right up on the board
S0570	do you know i say say that to me today
S0517	and who do
S0570	say he say that to me yesterday when we be sit there he be like i'm do this i'm tell you this in your best interest for tennis but i'm never gonna be anything more than a club player at max level you've gotta move on fine a new double partner
S0517	sorry
S0570	you could go place
S0570	that's what he be say to me as we be lose the second set
S0517	how would it go though if you and your brother
S0570	he's gonna go to uni
S0571	he be gonna go to uni
S0517	oh so then
S0570	so that's probably gonna happen isn't it so
S0517	so you and can play together and
S0517	and you two
S0572	and
S0517	and up on the board
S0570	in two years
S0517	winners
S0570	it'll be when he go university
S0572	but everyone think you know when win it this year everyone's gonna think it's and everyone's gonna think it's him isn't it
S0571	that's fine by me
S0517	that's why he's gonna play
S0570	yeah
S0517	tomorrow cos everyone's gonna think it's
S0517	and 's gonna give it his best shoot
S0571	i want you to play together but i don't want you to get upset with him
S0517	and it would be
S0571	because i know if you have a go at him on the tennis court it doesn't work
S0517	the other thing be though it would be a shame
S0571	if i ever have a go at you
S0517	it would be a shame to not play with cos you and have be like
S0572	not on not on the court
S0517	haven't you
S0570	yeah well
S0517	for like years
S0571	during the match have i ever have a go
S0517	haven't you that would be a big decision because and have play double for a long you know
S0571	yeah i know they have
S0517	that would be a big decision to not play with
S0571	but also you've gotta understand the if that's his brother
S0517	i know i know that's why i'm say it's a big decision because and have be a double pair
S0571	yeah but nobody would play them together
S0517	what do you mean
S0571	they they wouldn't play them together for the club for age
S0517	yeah because they be little
S0571	mm er
S0517	but they would now wouldn't they
S0571	they do sometimes
S0517	now they've prove themselves
S0570	hasn't be play have he
S0571	they don't rate as a double player
S0517	don't they
S0571	no
S0570	some of them be start to cos he be insane at the net
S0571	he be he's very good but he's get
S0517	and he's very quick
S0571	his serve be appal
S0570	i know but that's what people be say
S0517	that's the only thing
S0570	oh you it some of the pickups you have to make off your serve be incredible
S0571	because of
S0570	pickups off the return of his serve
S0571	who be say to
S0570	yeah cos he he yeah he serve
S0571	yeah
S0570	very weak but he do make quite a few of them even though it do put us on the back foot
S0571	but against it's it's okay
S0517	mm
S0571	against average club players but when you play decent players
S0571	they'll just rip his serve apart don't they
S0570	yeah
S0517	whereas you will rise above that because
S0571	thing be you're gonna grow
S0517	you're a better server you
S0571	and you're gonna grow you're you will be six foot plus
S0570	you're gonna be like who's fit
S0571	you're gonna be you be gonna have a massive serve and you be gonna have a massive forehand you need to work on your backhand
S0517	again you're welcome
S0572	i don't wanna be that tall though
S0517	how tall do you wanna be
S0571	i never want to be tall either
S0517	didn't you
S0571	no
S0572	six foot one
S0517	why
S0571	that's my height
S0572	six
S0517	why don't you wanna be taller
S0572	don't' know
S0517	why not
S0572	i wanna be average height
S0571	cos you stick out
S0572	yeah
S0517	tall men be more successful in business it's be prove
S0571	doesn't mean anything when you're grow up
S0571	and you're be a sportsman do it
S0517	yeah but it's an advantage in tennis isn't it to be tall
S0571	yeah a massive advantage cos it mean that
S0570	not in everything
S0571	when when you're serve that there's a lot more of the serve that's
S0570	aspect
S0517	pardon
S0570	not in every aspect like and 's
S0517	yeah much bigger
S0570	a lot taller
S0571	well no that's to do with them be better players that's not just about physically
S0570	i think physical play a massive part in tennis
S0571	it be but it also incredibly mental
S0517	i think it's nice to be tall
S0570	if you look at like and they can rock up and win their single you look at and they don't have anywhere near the physical state those two do and they don't rock up and win their single
S0571	what be you say 's get a good physical aspect
S0570	yeah he take his top of er at he's rip
S0571	oh okay sorry
S0517	he's only little
S0571	but he's not tall he's not tall
S0517	he's only small but he's
S0570	no but
S0517	muscular
S0570	muscular endurance
S0571	well yeah
S0571	you look at your brother though and in term of those aspects he's get a lot of endurance
S0570	yeah and that's why he's better than like cos

S0571	cos it's not be it
S0517	but you're the one to beat so be like he's take a set off he's so happy he's gonna be make up that's his night make

S0517	to him you've miss the point
S0517	be his that be his like i'm so happy
S0571	do you think it matter if you don't if he doesn't win a game off you that's a bad day if he win

S0571	that's like
S0517	he be ecstatic
S0570	it's like when you
S0517	that have make his weekend
S0570	if you play if you didn't win a game you'd be slightly disappoint if you want a set off you'd be over the

S0571	be it hit harder or be it just
S0570	i don't know i don't know
S0517	that's where he have
S0517	the advantage he go in there with a game plan know how to beat you or he'd watch you and he'd work out in his mind what to do
S0571	well well wasn't it
S0517	but that come from experience doesn't it
S0571	wasn't it no some of it do and some it come from
S0571	about just think
S0517	bless you
S0571	well we're not gonna have those potatoes now be we
S0517	that be vile
S0570	put your hand over your mouth
S0517	he's just sneeze
S0517	over those potatoes
S0571	so
S0517	vile isn't he
S0571	but some of it come down to
S0517	straight those into the bin please god
S0571	be be it you get to the net off his drop shoot and didn't know what to do with the ball or didn't have a enough enough options to think about it
S0570	i don't know it's i don't know
S0572	i'm gonna go for a shower
S0570	how i if i know
S0517	okay
S0570	i would have change it wouldn't i
S0571	yeah yeah absolutely
S0517	and that's do you think that if you have a lesson with you couldn't i don't know how do you learn how to
S0570	well i dunno cos
S0517	read those game
S0570	have lessons for
S0517	well it's it's how do you learn how to read those game
S0517	and work out how to improve how to beat somebody
S0571	but do let's let's be clear at sixteen you're not fully you're you're gonna develop more you're gonna grow muscle you're gonna get stronger you're gonna get quicker er you'll you'll be at your prime at sort of twenty one twenty two
S0570	what where be now
S0517	yes
S0571	yeah
S0517	he's twenty one isn't he
S0571	yeah
S0570	i need to get to 's level
S0517	be he twenty one or be he twenty two
S0571	pardon
S0570	i need to get to 's level
S0571	you will but don't
S0517	you will he's not he's what he be twenty one
S0571	yeah
S0517	he's not twenty two yet yeah yeah he's in his prime
S0571	so i mean er you're already quicker round the court i know you berate yourself so many time about speed around the court but people will always do good shots and
S0517	i think you're a really good player and to be where you be at this level in this club at this age
S0571	you're be i mean you take
S0517	it's fantastic
S0571	although he's fifty five when you diminish in skill it diminish over time but you've still get the technical ability and the other thing you can do be you can think about okay that's his game how be i gonna to beat him
S0517	how will i get around that
S0571	whereas you haven't get that experience to think about he go into it with a game plan i'll bring him to the net you obviously think
S0517	that's a compliment in itself that he have to go into play you with a plan because he know he wouldn't beat you from the back of the court he know he wouldn't beat you
S0571	i think that's quite funny really
S0517	if you if he get if you get what be it if you get him to the net
S0571	he yeah if he come to the net he'd pass you
S0517	he know certain things so he go in there with a game plan on how to beat you but that's come with experience and age
S0571	you know he doesn't like that much by the sound of things he think the draw
S0570	i tell you that
S0571	yeah you tell me that mm but they be they be double partner for age they still be
S0517	they still be
S0571	i find that odd don't you
S0517	it's cos it's cos they can win
S0570	he probably he probably doesn't hold that much of a grudge do he
S0517	it's cos they can win together
S0571	i would wouldn't you
S0570	yeah
S0517	you would course you would that's you
S0570	he's probably just tell himself that didn't fix the draw he's just but he tell me that
S0571	if i believe somebody have fix the draw i
S0517	you wouldn't be play double with them
S0571	no i wouldn't
S0570	he he tell me that he think he be just be pathetic look back at it now
S0571	that be be pathetic
S0570	yeah he tell me that he think he he be be pathetic but
S0571	well if that be if that's the case
S0517	well you say that but i mean he be in his mid forties when he think that mid to late forties like it's not like a a teenager or an early
S0571	no
S0517	twenties or somebody that's still work out who they be i mean he be a middle age man decide he'd be pathetic
S0571	mind you sport be a funny thing
S0517	what that competitive thing
S0571	yeah it be
S0517	yeah i don't get that i haven't get that i haven't get that competitive gene
S0571	there's nothing worse than lose a game
S0517	that be knock out of me at a very young age
S0571	be there
S0517	cos i lose everything
S0571	there be nothing and then somebody try and try to speak to you after that game to tell you where he's go wrong and you're think i don't really wanna talk to you now
S0517	mm
S0571	i get that i do get that
S0570	didn't wanna talk after today
S0517	no he didn't
S0571	no he didn't
S0517	he go home he do not want to talk
S0570	but he say goodbye to everyone didn't he
S0517	he be pleasant
S0571	he he's a really nice lad
S0517	he be a nice he be really pleasant but no he do not want to hang around today he take that badly i think be fourteen be fourteen and he lose to him but he take it really well and he play really well and he's a lovely
S0571	bigger issue's the bigger issue's gonna be when start come through cos he be gonna be twice the player than anyone we've get now
S0517	do you think
S0570	yeah
S0571	yeah
S0570	oh he's twelve have you see his technical ability
S0571	it's incredible
S0517	yes but
S0570	they reckon he's but er mm we can't say anything about cos wasn't play tennis at the age of twelve which be stupid but he's better than when be that age
S0517	have he get the natural ability or be it just all practice
S0571	the only the only thing that he hasn't get be he hasn't get the mental stability
S0517	no he hasn't yet
S0571	cos somebody like
S0570	but he want it so he's get the mental stability to keep play tennis cos he want it that's all he think about tennis
S0517	i know yeah have he give up all his other sport
S0570	yeah
S0517	he have
S0571	have he
S0570	well yeah he must've he's down there every day
S0571	well the football season's shut hasn't it
S0570	i don't think he play football
S0571	he do
S0517	he do
S0571	he do he play for
S0570	oh
S0517	gosh we've have a lot of wine dad
S0571	his mum you have
S0571	his er his mum erm his mum use to run the team and er and weren't very complimentary about her and him but i've gotta say i think 's a a really nice lad
S0517	i quite like his mum and dad too
S0570	they're just his mum dress weirdly
S0571	she
S0517	she do she do dress weirdly
S0571	she give you a kiss today didn't she
S0517	she love me she's always very very welcome hello
S0517	kiss on the cheek she's lovely i mean she's very very and i don't know whether it be a phase but they'd love that want to play with cos can play well they want him as the double partner she's very very
S0571	they always seem very pleasant they always seem very pleasant
S0517	yes they do they do
S0570	yes cos 's dad can see he's the best player at the club for 's age he can see who that be
S0571	i don't i don't i
S0570	cos 's dad's not gonna like
S0571	be they that do you reckon they're that calculate
S0570	he complain when he have to play with at squad i don't think any other parent would complain just cos their child's play with
S0571	mm
S0517	no you're right they wouldn't
S0570	i mean you're not bother if hit with in the squad
S0517	no no of course not
S0571	no it's fun
S0570	exactly
S0571	it's it's er
S0570	whereas he think he's play with when he could be play with someone like why i want my son play with
S0571	i've tell him that his problem will be
S0517	who tell who
S0571	i've tell that erm 's issue will be that he will want er he will lack competition at this club and that he he really need to be hit with the like of at the moment but if he continue to play at the rate he's get
S0570	but he go to a squad at and help coach him but
S0517	thing be though you say that but
S0570	they can reach 's level
S0517	when you watch i mean i only watch a couple of game tonight with and i know he's only play against and then you walk up and watch
S0571	it's a different level
S0570	yeah
S0517	it be a different
S0571	no you can't compare
S0570	you can't you can't
S0517	level
S0571	you can't tell you can't tell
S0570	you
S0571	you can't tell
S0570	and that's the biggest difference
S0517	i know but like like
S0571	but you you
S0517	be
S0571	hang on take that back a step right you look at today
S0517	yeah
S0571	and you look at erm be twice the player of 's lose to
S0517	that's true yeah that's true
S0571	beat today
S0517	yeah that's true
S0570	can probably beat
S0571	he er yeah but because
S0517	that's just the way they hit isn't it
S0571	it's the way they hit
S0517	it's the pace
S0571	and
S0570	the way they play together
S0571	unfortunately
S0517	he like pace
S0571	on the day against make so many errors whereas today he make
S0517	no
S0517	he be on form
S0570	hot and cold
S0571	be very hot and cold
S0570	and you can
S0517	he's not
S0570	you saw that from the county cup last year
S0517	he's not consistent enough be he
S0570	love and love to a third set tie name me one other person that could do that
S0517	and then the follow day yeah
S0571	er if he play every day he could be an incredible player
S0517	yeah yeah
S0571	i i think that's a fair thing to say
S0570	yeah he could probably reach
S0571	no i don't know if he's that good i don't know if he's that good
S0517	so could you you need to play and play and play cos you're good you're good
S0571	i think you're very good actually
S0517	it be fun to watch you and play together yesterday in the final set it wasn't fun when i saw you in the last throw of the middle set that you lose which be just pathetic and then when i say to you
S0571	when i've see you and play and when i've see you play double at time i i i just
S0517	it's it's really
S0571	incredible
S0517	great to watch you play er so well
S0570	do you think me be a good double pair i ask this question
S0517	yeah
S0570	do you actually think we be a good double pair together
S0517	it's no good ask me i can't base it on anything i think it be great to watch you
S0570	or do you think it's just because
S0517	when you're on form
S0570	we've play with each other for such a long time
S0517	but that's a good thing because you know each other's game
S0570	but do in
S0571	i think you're a really i i think you have the potential to be a very good double pair
S0517	you know each other's game
S0570	player or pair
S0517	cos you've grow up together
S0571	pair
S0517	you've grow up together
S0571	i think you have all the back court er ability i think your volley will come i do think your er volley will come his reactions be incredible
S0517	er be so super quick still
S0571	i think you're
S0517	i mean that that that that shoot he play
S0517	be unbelievable
S0571	i i think you be a better single player than
S0517	yeah i do too these days
S0571	i think you've you you're a step ahead of er
S0517	he's much more erratic
S0571	of of him
S0517	his serve still let him down
S0571	and if i mean you're you're you're not gonna go to the final together this year which be a real shame because the the the finals that you two have put on over the years
S0570	they've always be third set
S0571	oh they've be fantastic
S0517	oh they've be better than the men's finals
S0571	oh miles better
S0517	way better
S0571	and technically miles better
S0517	way better
S0570	what do you think last year be better than
S0517	oh
S0570	and
S0517	way better and it be
S0571	i think 's
S0517	it be bore
S0571	a spend force be a spend
S0517	that be bore have it in his bag
S0571	the only reason he beat you
S0517	it be just bore
S0571	be be an old man play tennis
S0570	yeah but do you not think more people watch the men's final than the juniors
S0517	no i think a lot of people watch your game
S0571	i think a lot of people come down to watch the men's final and watch the under seventeens
S0517	and end up watch yours
S0571	this year i don't think that'll be the case cos i don't think there's anyone of 's ability to face you
S0517	i think it's likely to be you versus
S0570	or
S0517	yeah
S0570	in a in a way i'd like to beat just on the big stage in front of er you know
S0517	no because that would mean have lose to him
S0570	yeah i know yeah that's the only reason why i wouldn't wanna do it but
S0571	well i i i get that
S0517	i think i i don't want to watch you versus i don't want to watch that
S0570	i'd quite like to play
S0517	i don't wanna watch you
S0571	i don't wanna watch you versus but on the flipside of it i don't wanna
S0570	you don't wanna watch lose to
S0571	i don't wanna watch
S0517	no
S0571	lose to and secondly i and i i know i know that day be gonna come
S0517	but i don't wanna watch
S0570	yeah it shouldn't come yet should it it's not far away though
S0571	he's play every day and he's play
S0517	and i don't wanna watch
S0517	and i don't wanna watch you
S0570	my aim be to grow out of the under seventeens before he beat me
S0517	i don't wanna watch you lose to
S0570	which be what what this year and next year
S0517	i don't wanna watch you i don't want to watch you lose to
S0570	oh no
S0517	yet
S0570	i've get i've get a whole i get the er the aim be
S0570	to not win the juniors er to not lose
S0517	i'm okay
S0570	to any juniors in the junior tournament
S0517	when you're both adults and you're both
S0570	yeah once i'm once er once i'm in the men's that's alright
S0517	no you're right i don't wanna watch
S0570	and it'll be quite unlikely that i'll draw him in the men's ever
S0517	i don't wanna watch you
S0570	for a for at least
S0517	lose to
S0570	four or five years
S0517	and i don't wanna watch lose to
S0570	and i can see him go to uni so
S0571	i dunno
S0517	i think i
S0571	the most important for me for for if er you
S0570	well men's single final me
S0571	no i wouldn't like that cos i wouldn't i i i don't wanna see you get frustrate and lose the game through frustration if you're gonna lose the if you lose the game through
S0570	skill
S0571	skill that's one thing but i actually think as a player you be far more technically correct than
S0570	do you
S0571	absolutely
S0570	do you think i look technically correct
S0571	yes
S0517	yeah
S0570	when i'm play tennis cos i don't think look feel like i
S0571	i er i think he do
S0517	mm
S0571	i think your backhand be perfect your forehand be be great at the moment your
S0517	who do you think be quicker around the court
S0570	be physically better than me
S0517	i think be maybe quicker
S0571	i think so
S0517	and i think you need to work on that
S0571	i think have and and he probably have a bite more fight spirit sometimes than you do
S0517	be more mentally he go out there believe he believe in himself
S0571	so if if a few point go
S0517	three hundred per cent
S0571	i mean you hear him today i can beat
S0517	he step out on court and he be
S0571	and he do believe that
S0517	a winner
S0571	and i i actually think he think we be gonna get to the double final this year
S0571	he do believe that
S0517	he do
S0571	i do i think he do
S0517	he like we've say before he would step out against andy murray and believe in himself
S0517	but you don't have that but he have that belief he think
S0517	he think
S0517	you know at the very least he think he'd take a game from andy murray
S0517	and he believe that doesn't he
S0571	he do
S0517	he absolutely believe that and that's the difference
S0571	and don't and please don't ever knock that out of him cos i think that be a really really
S0517	that's a fantastic
S0517	no don't knock it out of him cos that's a great
S0517	it's a it's an asset
S0571	it's a great asset
S0517	because
S0517	mentally he's halfway there when he step out on that court
S0571	and er and erm say to me well the problem with be he doesn't care
S0517	he do care
S0571	i think he he care massively
S0517	he care
S0571	he when he lose to
S0517	he care
S0571	he be in tear in the change room
S0570	be he
S0517	he just doesn't show it
S0571	he be massively upset
S0517	he's care he just doesn't show it he's get this thing that
S0571	that's between you and i
S0570	mm
S0517	i'm lay back i don't do this i don't do that but he care he care massively
S0571	he be gutted absolutely and i think part of that be about the whole image thing which really upset me cos i'm not into that
S0571	but but he care he doesn't wanna lose nor do you
S0570	no
S0571	i get that i get that and and the whole thing with if it if it be anyone i would choose that you didn't lose to it would be cos i don't particularly like the guy
S0517	but he's a good player
S0571	but actually
S0517	he's a good player
S0571	of all the people for you to lose to he's not a bad person
S0571	he's good he's a good player
S0517	mm
S0570	well we'll see won't we when so long as he best not lose to at least
S0571	you can't tell you can't tell cos you don't know what what style of play they'll play
S0517	thing be you're only sixteen you're still sixteen you've get
S0571	by the time you're eighteen
S0517	and by the time you're eighteen
S0571	you'll have another thirty miles an hour on your serve
S0570	mm
S0517	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0571	you'll er you'll be able to volley your volley be weak we all know that's the weakest
S0571	part of your game
S0570	yeah
S0571	don't you think
S0570	yeah
S0571	you know i could sit here and say oh you're great yeah everything you're your volley be you know you look at your backhand you can make a backhand shoot that nobody else can make at that club er
S0570	yeah
S0571	er grind shots the the only person to compete with you at the back of the court apart from be be and even be just erratic so
S0517	you will be very very very good at that club
S0571	but again but the important
S0517	but it'll come with age
S0571	the important the important thing be where's that gonna lead and what do you wanna do with your life and we've already talk about okay yeah you know erm and say he'll find work for you you've get a couple of years of work when you leave school
S0517	if you want it
S0571	but you don't wanna be teach the duffers do you
S0570	no you'd wanna be with teach the good players
S0571	you do you wanna
S0517	yeah
S0571	er and er
S0517	you do
S0571	you know you've get people like that as much as people take the mickey out of you teach a middle age woman okay that's bread and butter for a tennis coach
S0570	yeah
S0517	yeah there's load of those middle age women in
S0571	i do when i do my
S0517	there be load of them
S0571	when i be er i be a bite older than you but when i i be do personal i personal train middle age women to pay for our honeymoon
S0517	there's a lot
S0517	sadly
S0571	that's what i do
S0517	there's a lot of middle age women with a lot of disposable income
S0571	there's nothing wrong with be middle age and there's nothing wrong with be a woman that want to improve her tennis
S0517	and and and they don't need to work and they're they're just
S0571	but you've get
S0517	they it's a hobby and they want to improve on it
S0571	but you've gotta understand you're gonna be play at that level you're not gonna be you're not gonna be train
S0570	do you think that ever frustrate the he doesn't get to play at his level often enough
S0517	he never say don't know do you have you ask him
S0570	do you think deep down it do he would never admit it though
S0517	no it's his it's his job it's his job to teach people
S0571	would he like to coach people at a higher level possibly yes
S0570	no but do you think deep down he wish that he play at his level more often as in like he play
S0571	of course he do
S0570	tennis
S0571	and that that that that be one of my point to you
S0517	no
S0571	about it be one of my reservations about you go into tennis coach that you play tennis to enjoy it do you wanna play tennis as a job because there be two er you know i i play rugby for a long period of time at a reasonable level i then go into fitness and it be a job and yes i train hard and i play hard and all the rest of it but it you you've get to understand that at one point it's a job and the other point it's it's for free time and if you spend
S0517	bless you
S0517	bless you
S0571	if you spend nine hours in a gym a day train other people do you wanna spend another two hours in the gym train yourself
S0570	no
S0571	and and the and same with the tennis court if you spend eight hours on court a day be you gonna wanna spend another two hours play yourself
S0517	unless you're me
S0571	you might want to
S0517	and then dad want to spend time train
S0571	absolutely i'd spend all my time train your mother
S0517	yes yes
S0571	but you you might do it you might wanna do that and and do that's what enjoy
S0570	what coach
S0571	yeah
S0517	mm he love it
S0570	you're watch he love watch people develop doesn't he
S0517	yeah he do yeah
S0570	over time
S0571	yeah i think he do
S0517	have you ask him how much you should charge
S0570	you ah just hit my funny bone no
S0517	and what do he say
S0570	yeah i have and he hasn't reply
S0517	because you need a a definitive answer on that coach thing
S0570	i'm see him tomorrow
S0517	well ask him so that because i don't wanna undersell you but you know six pound an hour isn't massive i know you're only sixteen but it's not massive be it no
S0571	six pound an hour it's not bad
S0517	no i know but he's do two level of coach we've pay for that
S0571	i know that but he he he's it's very difficult it be very difficult
S0517	it's er i know but i know he's only young but you don't want to
S0571	he's young
S0517	undersell him
S0571	and no he's do it as pocket money that's the problem if he be do it as a job you'd be say hang on i want twenty quid an hour for that
S0517	well you do yeah but he's get the qualifications to charge twenty quid an hour but because he's erm but because
S0571	i know
S0517	because of his age and what he's do you you can't undersell him
S0571	do you wanna teach
S0570	can do well i i mean to talk to before erm

S0570	yeah i've only do it twice
S0517	but we need to say to he's happy to just have a knock with him and teach him because teach him english in primary school and help him
S0571	it's not only that let's be honest it's that it's about the fact that have be good to us as a family

S0571	pardon
S0517	i'd like this
S0570	be it a full time job er with
S0571	no no no this be when you when you get
S0570	be like a side business
S0571	yeah when when you get to a certain level you can er advise er and spend well i don't know three or four days a month just help a business out and they will pay you an amount of money and er be a director of a company er i need to go back to him fairly quickly
S0570	i assume his company's do well
S0571	well he's only just start it but they they've er raise they're do phenomenally well er and he want to know whether i'd be interest in invest in that company but i would probably need to find i dunno ten twenty thousand pound
S0570	ask auntie
S0517	no chuck it no we've overpay on the mortgage from months and months and months we could we could find ten grand easily
S0571	well
S0517	but mum need to think about it when she's sober
S0571	it need to those sort of decisions
S0570	that's a lot of
S0571	which i have to say it
S0570	but be quite for er you trust don't you
S0517	yeah
S0571	i do trust but you've gotta
S0570	could you trust with ten grand
S0571	you've gotta remember that have make a quite a few ball up in his career
S0570	what's that mean ball up
S0517	bad decisions
S0571	bad decisions
S0570	oh
S0571	and i've bail him out every time he be a go getter and he will make a lot of money and he want to give me the first opportunity to invest in this business i actually think it's a i think it's probably a goer but
S0570	do you feel like an entrepreneur dad
S0571	do i feel like an entrepreneur
S0517	remind me again what be the business
S0571	it's about not invasive beauty treatments
S0517	facials
S0571	facials
S0517	non invasive
S0571	yeah
S0517	facials
S0571	it's that kind of
S0570	do you know if dad's share be still do okay after we've leave the eu
S0517	yeah i do yeah yeah
S0571	but i think erm
S0517	mm
S0571	er and
S0517	i think the beauty treatment world be a it's a no brainer
S0571	it be a no brainer
S0517	women will always always always pay
S0571	and even if
S0517	for beauty treatments
S0571	the other thing with
S0517	they just will
S0571	be that he for one reason or another value my opinion so if i tell him something he believe it
S0571	absolutely believe it erm and
S0570	what so best if you if you if if you trust him with ten grand it would just be like i'm gonna do it
S0571	well not just that it's just i i mean we don't go into these sort of things with our eye shut but the fact be the business could go belly up and we could lose our money yeah we could do that but on the flipside if it erm be very
S0570	it's a nice business to have on the side
S0571	be very value drive he erm er he he he value what i've do for him in his life so far so so a lot of it's to do with the fact you can go through life and you could tread on people's head to get to where you wanna get to so you can you can
S0517	mm
S0571	start it at group a a erm group a grass root level and er undermine your boss and get their job and get the next job and get the next job i've always look after erm not not and i've do nothing untoward he's be good for me as well but i've believe in him and i've invest in him and he he now feel and i in some ways i think it's quite wrong he feel a sense of obligation to me that if he if he be gonna make a lot of money out of something he want to include me and that's very nice that's he doesn't need to do that but
S0517	mm
S0571	he he's get that opportunity now that opportunity might fall flat on its face and if we if we invest twenty grand in that that's twenty grand that could go to you and in the future or to
S0517	or
S0571	your mother
S0517	or to you mother yeah what do think then what do you want to do
S0571	i think we probably need to talk about it when you haven't have so much to drink
S0517	or you
S0571	my gut feel be that we we probably need to have a a chat round the table with and say look okay we're prepare to invest in it if we be what be the return
S0517	mm
S0571	what do you want back from us you know do they want market support form you if that's the case okay we can do that do they want management consultancy from me fine we can do we can do that but be
S0517	yeah
S0571	his own management consultant and i don't necessarily always agree with
S0517	no no
S0571	so we need to have that conversation round the table
S0517	mm interest though

S0571	erm i'm hopeful that can make good on his suggestion that he advise find you something out in spain or or wherever just experience something a bite different
S0517	thing be would you go to spain by yourself and work
S0570	i don't know do i until i get
S0571	i think it

S0571	i think it er i think if if he's go to spain to teach tennis
S0517	mm
S0571	what we would do to help him do that because i i haven't be in 's situation i i be always put in a situation where you go and that be it you you there be no option
S0517	mm

S0517	well i'm just
S0571	so
S0517	interest because you have a very different upbringing to me i go off to university at eighteen to me that be a massive deal i leave home go on my own know no one go to uni but that's
S0571	for him it's even a bigger deal
S0517	because it's abroad
S0571	but what what i would say be okay he get a job somewhere wherever it be you go out there for a couple of weeks
S0517	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0571	to help him settle in and he he get the opportunity you know what whatever er you he might not even while you're there and if that's the case you blend into the background and let him
S0517	mm mm
S0571	get on with his life and you go off and do your own thing but you've at least get some security blanket for a couple of weeks
S0517	yeah yeah
S0571	and then after that he always the world be a very small place now if it's er er if you go to work
S0517	yes
S0571	in australia and it be all go wrong some man be after you with a machete
S0571	you can jump on a plane and you're back here in twenty four hours and you know you've get a roof over your head you've get somewhere to stay
