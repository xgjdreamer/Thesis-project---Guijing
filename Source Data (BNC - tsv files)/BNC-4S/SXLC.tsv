S0663	mm
S0662	and be erm you know helpful and so on and so forth
S0661	yeah but a lot of like what that's what he's do

S0660	see what else there be
S0663	have the fiesta go as well cos sometimes you can actually
S0660	mm
S0663	look at it even though it's be sell and get some sort of idea
S0662	mm
S0661	yeah i think i think it'd go they pick it up yesterday
S0663	mm
S0660	but they have a vauxhall corsa
S0661	he have a mm mm
S0663	mm
S0660	they have a ford focus which we take a test drive but on retrospect we've realise cos they're one point they they're all one point six
S0663	mm
S0660	it's just a bite too big for us and it be a big car really wasn't it
S0661	i like it
S0660	i know you like it but it be like felt like you be lug it around compare to
S0661	it felt a bite sluggish
S0660	compare to
S0661	for a one point six
S0660	our car
S0663	although you can you get a you can get a it depend what year you're look at but the more modern say fiesta be bigger than the the old
S0662	oh yeah
S0663	fiesta because
S0661	yeah
S0663	small cars be bigger than they ever be
S0662	yeah
S0660	mm well this be a focus
S0663	that be a focus
S0663	right
S0663	yeah okay
S0661	so you really like that corsa
S0660	mm
S0661	corsa be quite
S0660	it be two thousand and six but it felt so much more modern than the two thousand and six fiestas it be really nice
S0661	yeah it be really nice inside like
S0660	and the spec cos it be the corsa design that's their
S0660	model
S0663	so have you get more
S0660	design
S0661	design oh okay
S0663	so you've get more
S0660	so the spec inside be nice and it be part leather and
S0663	oh very nice i like leather seat
S0662	do you remember
S0661	see i don't like leather seat cos of
S0661	no cos i think they they get
S0661	too hot and sticky in the summer and they're just really cold in the winter they're just always the opposite of what you need
S0663	oh i like i just like leather seat they're just
S0661	and it it do have a leather cover on the steer wheel that be quite nice
S0663	yes so how what colour be it first of all
S0660	like a charcoal
S0661	the colour be really nice
S0663	oh right
S0661	it be he say it be blue and i be like
S0660	wasn't
S0661	cos he be show me the mot and i be like yeah yeah i be like hang on it say blue be that the right car cos i'm sure it wasn't blue but it kind of look like charcoalish blue
S0663	so like black blue kind of grey like a slight
S0661	ish grey yeah it it be it be really nice actually that colour wasn't it
S0662	what what what what make of car be it
S0661	it be a vauxhall corsa
S0662	oh
S0661	and you really like it your grandad's always drive corsas cos he use to work for vauxhall
S0660	grandad work for vauxhall so
S0663	oh well yeah there you go then so he's
S0662	it's funny isn't it yeah
S0663	get
S0660	my my my uncle my grandad's brother in law my grandma's brother he work he's always work for ford so he's always drive ford but then he move to jaguar
S0661	do you say he use to be able to er
S0660	and like they now do
S0661	they use to be able to see the factories from the other side of the mersey
S0660	yeah because the ford factory be in liverpool
S0663	yes
S0660	and the vauxhall factory be in and my
S0663	yeah
S0660	grandad use to joke say they'd like wave their fists across the
S0660	mersey the river that start come in
S0663	yeah you've get you've get sort of somebody's opinion on both side
S0661	whereas i know that dad hat all his all his corsas and he have load of problems with them but that they be quite old
S0663	well that's the thing he do but then again
S0661	long time ago
S0663	two thousand and six so how much be this one this two thousand and six one
S0660	it be
S0661	three
S0660	nearly three and a half
S0661	and er they
S0660	but it's because the mileage be only thirty four thousand
S0663	so it may've be look after and
S0660	the first woman that own it erm
S0661	hardly drive it
S0660	she drive it like a thousand miles a year
S0663	right
S0660	yeah
S0663	oh
S0661	so i be think if we because we like it and because we don't do too many miles we could probably get the same a similar age car maybe a bite younger i think you find a younger one with more mileage for bite more of a reasonable price
S0662	mm mm
S0660	for a bite for a for a less price
S0663	yeah
S0661	so
S0660	we're go to see a corsa tomorrow aren't we in
S0661	and we book one in tomorrow so cos we didn't test drive that one we only test drive the focus cos we have to get to to see another one so we didn't have time but
S0663	so you didn't test drive that corsa
S0660	the corsa no but we'll test drive one tomorrow
S0661	not the corsa only the focus yeah
S0663	so be it a modernish body shape
S0660	yeah it be lovely
S0661	yeah
S0660	it
S0663	yeah
S0660	look a lot nicer than the fiestas of that same year
S0663	mm
S0661	yeah the fiestas of the same time be just horrible
S0660	boxy boxy and
S0663	if they be boxy they'll be look very date now won't they
S0661	absolutely yeah
S0660	but the corsa be just a lot more sleek and
S0663	mm so what size engine be this
S0662	have you see have you see erm a erm a oh we've just say the ford
S0661	fiesta
S0662	er yeah a a
S0663	fiesta
S0662	sort of a more update not necessarily
S0660	well that be the last one that we've see before we come here in
S0661	that be the last one
S0660	that be a two
S0661	yeah
S0660	two thousand and nine i know it's that's still like seven years old
S0660	but it's it the it be two thousand and eight be it two thousand and eight where the model get
S0662	change
S0661	mm
S0660	revamp
S0662	yeah yeah
S0660	and since then they've just look a lot more modern
S0661	mm mark seven i think
S0662	they do it be cos they it's go on all the time you see isn't it really do you remember the time when have trouble with with this one
S0663	mm mm
S0662	do you remember when i be come down drive i be drive and it it conk out where you come to the end of it and you turn right you know to come and that lady stop
S0663	lady stop mm didn't she have a fiesta
S0662	she have a fiesta and it be a white one and it be i be bowl over cos i've not be in a fiesta for donkey's years and
S0662	it be absolutely beautiful and i be so impress and i say it's really lovely and
S0661	mm
S0662	she say yes i'm really please with it you know erm it be white and then all black inside you know and i always remember her you know cos it be so startle but then again it's a big change when they do move up isn't it when they when they modernise that's apart from the
S0661	yeah
S0662	electronics and all the rest of it
S0661	yeah it feel a lot it be really nice look inside and
S0663	so do you do you drive the fiesta
S0660	mm
S0661	yeah go to this guy's house in that we go to
S0660	yeah it be wasn't a private seller
S0661	it be a trade
S0660	it be a trade seller but they're
S0661	yeah
S0660	in the in between erm garage
S0663	okay
S0660	so he's he's operate from home at the moment
S0663	so be he how much be that one
S0660	it be three thousand seven hundred and ninety i think so
S0661	so i think it be a bite overprice for what it be because it be a low spec car
S0660	i think it be overprice and for the year it's still two thousand and nine
S0661	didn't have air air condition yeah and it have a lot of miles fifty sixty thousand miles
S0663	mm
S0660	mm
S0660	but now we know
S0661	so that i think that be quite pricey
S0660	now we know what that style be like so we can try and find see if we can find something similar for less
S0661	yeah
S0663	and have you get something on your phone that you can check price it use to be call the erm glass glass's guide didn't it you your car price guide
S0662	yes glass's
S0663	yeah so can actually put
S0663	erm
S0662	that be the name of it wasn't it
S0663	yeah yeah you can put your
S0662	mm
S0663	car make and model year in and it will give you a current price
S0661	well we're do it on auto trader
S0663	oh right
S0661	cos they have like a valuation thing but
S0663	right
S0661	just look at what's on what the competition be for same model
S0662	they should make it a bite easier for you these days rather than
S0661	well it's a bite overwhelm the the website be really useful but there's just so much on there
S0662	mm yeah but there's too much too many
S0661	it's really it's a minefield
S0663	i think you've get to i think you have to sort of start and think about what you might like and then narrow it down
S0662	you've get to give them a it's
S0663	and
S0662	it's no good be very vague be it like well er any any i don't know
S0661	yeah
S0663	no i don't i think you've get to think well i don't want to accept a lower sort of erm
S0662	yeah mm
S0663	engine size because if you or a lower specification if you and just rule them out because otherwise you then end up with a car that you don't like as much
S0662	mm
S0663	so and also if you if you want a one point four and you think well shall we have a look at the one point one oh it's quite nice you then have an underpowered car forever don't you you don't have it forever but you know for a for a long time you're think oh i wish i get a bite more
S0662	yeah
S0662	mm
S0663	sort of
S0660	well we're look at that like we're look at one point two one point two five really
S0663	yeah
S0660	think that's probably better for us cos we're drive round the city all the time
S0663	yeah
S0660	so
S0663	well it's good economy then isn't it good fuel economy
S0661	yeah
S0660	yeah
S0663	and you look at petrol
S0661	well the fiesta's confuse because their one litre be call an ecoboost so it's cheaper to tax cos it use less fuel but it's actually more powerful
S0663	right mm oh right okay
S0661	so which mean there's more to insure
S0663	right okay
S0661	so we're actually better off stick with our original plan of have a one point two
S0663	right
S0661	or it's one point two five the fiesta for some reason
S0663	mm
S0660	we're also go to see a mazda2 tomorrow
S0661	yeah
S0660	they're similar price range to the the corsas and the fiestas
S0663	mm
S0663	there be some nice look mazda cars about
S0660	yeah
S0662	what's the ford focus which one's that
S0663	that's the bigger bigger than the fiesta
S0662	the bigger one
S0663	yeah yeah
S0662	mm mm
S0661	i i like that
S0660	you do like it didn't you but we don't need a one point six litre
S0661	really big but we don't need it yeah
S0662	no no
S0660	engine
S0661	cost more to run and it and we just don't need that much space really
S0660	yeah no
S0663	do you look at a honda civic at all or have you not
S0660	we we we've do a
S0661	we do last week
S0660	we do and we're never look at one again cos we love them too much
S0662	oh
S0660	and they're too expensive
S0662	oh
S0663	be they expensive cos i can actually why do i not
S0660	yeah
S0661	yeah
S0662	well
S0663	cos we go you come with me didn't you you know when we go look at the garage on the main road erm at and we sit in didn't you you come with me didn't you

S0662	your your grandad always like rovers
S0661	yeah
S0662	but his brother erm he always like honda i always have a thing for honda
S0662	mainly because erm at that time the sort of it be all erm datsun and it everybody be praise the japanese and their engines you know and they have such a good
S0661	mm mm
S0662	at that time they build up a good reputation for the engine erm and have an accord didn't he which be like
S0663	mm
S0662	a bigger one that the civic
S0663	mm mm
S0662	erm and he actually have it so long that he have all the inside and the er upholstery and everything all change and
S0661	really
S0662	yeah but then i mean that he'd be an wouldn't he
S0662	nobody else would do that
S0663	well the honda so have you look at any honda civics
S0663	cos i i didn't they be that bad
S0661	they're too much money
S0663	be they too much money
S0661	the the old ones be cheap but the new ones be not
S0663	ah so what year do they change
S0661	they're more sporty about two thousand and
S0660	nine
S0661	four five six something like that
S0663	right and they're they're expensive aren't they
S0660	they're like six grand
S0661	the smallest engine you can get on them be a one point four
S0663	right okay so
S0661	they're quite big and yeah
S0663	cos they're it it's just
S0662	so in other word you don't really need one
S0661	no
S0662	no no you know what i mean
S0661	they're they're really nice but they're too too much money and you know
S0662	you can

S0661	no we can we can get the same result without spend as much money
S0662	yeah yeah
S0660	it'll it's will be nice to know that we love honda civics and we can aspire to that like i don't think we should just have everything now
S0661	someday

S0662	mm
S0663	so i make myself put them away
S0661	do you know why they're sweet though
S0661	they've get more sugar and more fat in them than normal crisp have
S0663	oh don't tell me that

S0660	yeah but be it not natural sugar
S0663	if it naturally occur i'm happy
S0661	in vegetables doesn't it in vegetables
S0660	it's do you not think sweet potato's get natural sugar in it

S0661	no
S0660	course it have
S0663	yes it have it will cos it's naturally sweet
S0660	don't just look at the the sugar on the where be it that thing that they have on the front look if it's something's get a high like raisins have
S0662	mm
S0660	be red on the sugar scale
S0663	but it's all naturally occur
S0660	but there's no sugar in it i know it's still natural sugar so you still shouldn't eat load of it but don't just go by the the traffic light symbol like avocados have really high fat but it's not add fat be it so you need to check the vegetable crisp and make and find out
S0661	no
S0663	it's good fat mm
S0660	it might not be sugar
S0663	mm they're lovely
S0661	okay

S0663	mm
S0662	first of february yeah
S0663	yeah grandad
S0661	mm
S0663	yeah
S0661	have you ever do have you ever research your family tree or anything
S0663	i've begin
S0661	do you
S0663	i'm at it i do it through be it genes reunite or be it i do sign up for something and i start but it be it be it quite longwinded and tedious and each time you look you buy you buy some credit and each time you look at something it diminish your
S0662	oh yeah
S0663	your credit go down and i think in the end i i kind of give i print at the time quite a few bits and piece which i've get somewhere and i give some to i think it be quite erm it just take time it all take a lot of time one day i just think i haven't get time to do that yet
S0660	mm
S0662	you have to wait till your retire to do that when you get time on your hand
S0660	get all the time then
S0662	mm
S0661	yeah i download an app but i've not really erm spend any time on it
S0663	it it's actually useful to ask question because i think i ask you at the time i ask you some question at the time about name and you know name of distant relatives and what have you
S0662	yeah but
S0661	and birthdays and
S0662	i don't know very far
S0663	mm
S0662	very really
S0663	but it's good it's useful
S0662	cos i mean my grandparents er be dead before i you know before i be bear so erm i only know little things like my mother's mother die at when they be on holiday you know little things
S0663	oh do they i don't think i've hear that before
S0660	really
S0662	she usually say that when i these little snippets cos i forget about them and then suddenly something i think of something and it trigger something else off and then i think oh i remember that oh
S0663	ah so what happen then
S0662	i've no idea you see when you be little you weren't suppose to ask any question and i mean i wouldn't think what we're go to do we're here at and she's die what we do i mean i i'd only be little then i wouldn't know anything about it
S0663	be you there though
S0662	mm
S0663	be you there
S0662	i suppose so cos my mother would be there with her so she'd have to do something with me so i expect i would be there
S0663	so what year do she die
S0662	oh crumb don't know well probably nineteen twenty
S0660	wow
S0662	six and and and this be all guesswork and
S0663	so you don't remember her at all
S0662	no no
S0663	what be she call what be her name
S0662	i don't think i know i only know my my mother's maiden name
S0663	no i know that but what what
S0662	that be a scottish connection because her father apparently come down from scotland it must've be when there be no work or something to work on the railway in manchester that's that's all i know
S0663	so which railway do he work on
S0662	oh heck that's far too complicate i don't i really don't know cos people didn't talk
S0663	no i know
S0662	my mother never tell us anything really and like my father wouldn't've tell you well wouldn't've dream to ask him then because he would be so horrify that you know would be amaze that you would ask
S0663	mm
S0662	people didn't ask then it's only now when children ask about weddings or anything you're suppose to be see and not hear
S0663	yes
S0660	my my grandma be say the same thing when we saw them at christmas cos she be tell us about how her uncle
S0662	mm mm
S0660	be in the war and when he come back he never talk about what happen
S0663	mm
S0660	apart from to my to my grandma's dad
S0662	yeah
S0660	and my and er i think my grandma's grandad as well
S0662	mm
S0660	and she be just like well you know we didn't ask him what have happen like
S0663	you you would think why didn't you ask but
S0660	yeah but you're just
S0663	you you wouldn't
S0660	you're just bring up not to know that if you do ask you'd be in trouble so you just
S0662	yeah
S0660	didn't and also it it wasn't the do thing to for men to talk about like kind of manly
S0662	they
S0660	things with
S0663	mm
S0660	i suppose
S0662	they just talk with men
S0660	yeah like you didn't
S0662	mm
S0660	didn't even share things with their partner
S0663	yeah
S0660	with their wive
S0663	mm
S0660	really
S0663	no
S0660	but
S0663	well
S0660	it's different now isn't it well slowly get there cos a lot of men still
S0662	yeah yeah
S0660	struggle to talk about things don't they
S0663	yes they do
S0660	cos it's the it's the culture but i think it's get cos that's why there's really high level of like like male depression and male suicides and stuff
S0663	yeah young yeah that's the biggest cause of death in young men be
S0660	yeah
S0663	be suicide between the age of i don't know it's like something like eighteen and
S0660	eighteen
S0662	mm
S0663	sort of late twenties whatever it it's it be the biggest cause of death suicide which be tragic
S0662	mm mm
S0660	yeah cos they're just not suppose to talk about things but everyone should be able to talk about anything they need to shouldn't they
S0663	and you think in this day and age but i suppose it also depend on i suppose your upbringing and whether you be able to talk
S0660	mm
S0663	with your parent about things
S0662	but you didn't talk to your dad about the war do you
S0663	yeah
S0662	do you
S0663	yeah
S0662	well then there you go then he do talk about it you see
S0663	but my dad be one that would would talk about mm
S0662	he be he be ah because
S0663	mm
S0662	lot of people didn't
S0663	i do that the other day i actually throw i be in bed and i have i'd make myself a cup of tea i be drink it and for some reason i manage to throw it over
S0663	just like i think they've get tea on my sheet now how do that happen
S0662	there be only you there
S0663	yeah
S0663	i be just think how do i do that i miss my mouth
S0661	just a good shoot
S0663	yeah
S0660	i remember
S0663	mm
S0660	lie on on the grass in the sun once one summer and we be at a festival or something and for some reason i think that i'd be able to have a sip of my drink lie down
S0660	do you remember that
S0661	yeah think so
S0660	cos i just though this be totally normal i'm so relax i'll just have a sip of my oh
S0660	obviously i just pour it all over my face
S0660	it's like how do that happen
S0663	you be so chill you weren't actually think about it
S0663	yeah
S0663	well my dad be a talker wasn't he
S0662	yeah
S0660	yeah
S0663	he really be so
S0660	that's good
S0663	he be that be it be good and it be but that be probably more bite more unusual
S0660	but but do you think do you think men like your dad maybe be see as a bite eccentric because of that
S0660	do you know because of everyone's quite
S0663	maybe he might've be be consider i don't know do you think he'd be consider soft not eccentric but you know he i don't know don't know because
S0662	well i remember i remember there be there be four four girls four of us at work that be friends
S0663	mm
S0662	and then after the war we'd all get marry and we all keep in touch and we all visit and
S0663	mm
S0662	make meals and what have you er and i remember my remember at the begin of course the blokes didn't really know one another only 's husband cos he work in the same company as we do and i remember one time there be the for some reason the blokes be talk separately and then i remember one of them and he your dad have be talk about you know the japanese and all of that and erm i remember one of them say to the other one you know something about god it must've be terrible you know but they didn't talk to us about it i mean he'd tell me bits but i mean he never talk to people he wouldn't've talk to i don't know who he wouldn't've talk to perhaps he would have i don't know but it must've be pretty horrible really but a lot of those i mean you've see picture on the telly of them where they're only about five stone in weight and whatnot and well they didn't give them any food and horrendous isn't it really
S0663	i think if you get catch they didn't want to get catch do they
S0662	that be the fear that's what it i remember him say
S0663	yeah but
S0662	and he be a radio
S0663	they be if if they be
S0662	mm
S0663	think he be a yeah
S0662	a wireless operator
S0663	a wireless operator
S0662	and i remember him tell me a bite about you know they dig the trench however many feet down they have to be and he'd be on the radio and he say you could hear them scream they be kind of surround more or less in this area and and then the japanese didn't to nighttime they'd start scream and you know rush across and he'd be on the radio inside the thing you know and he use to say you know that he use to think that he ought to be out with them you know i mean how how i think he'd've be think thank goodness i'm here do this
S0663	no but you probably feel guilty you and if somebody die you probably actually think oh my goodness i be in it in this trench and somebody be out there fight and and
S0662	mm
S0663	i i'm safe and you probably feel guilty you probably do
S0662	mm and
S0661	mm
S0663	i can understand it's a natural
S0662	this be when they talk about nobody want to be capture because they know the reputation of the i mean they be mad weren't they obviously
S0663	they be very cruel weren't they
S0662	mm mm
S0663	very cruel
S0662	and i mean they go in in these gliders and that's where that photograph of er charlie chaplin who you might or might not have hear of
S0663	yeah i've hear of charlie chaplin
S0662	and that's that's his erm
S0662	co partner in in the in a film
S0663	it be a co star in the film
S0662	i don't know which film it be cos
S0663	think the kid wasn't it the kid
S0662	i don't know
S0663	yeah
S0662	i only know about that other one where he write the music of it you know
S0663	but that's jackie coogan isn't it
S0662	oh yeah
S0663	when he be a child star
S0662	yeah and he he be the pilot of the glider that take them in what they do when they be go into the jungle they they they clear two two areas for them to take the the blokes in and one be call picadilly and what be the other call
S0663	i can't remember
S0662	yeah probably something like
S0662	chelsea or i don't know
S0663	that doesn't ring a bell
S0662	i don't know but that be what they call them and they take them in in the gliders and unfortunately when they come to land a lot of them crash and they lose a lot of people just like that and i remember him say about this you've hear it before
S0663	i have i have
S0662	what be he call somebody and they be sit in the at this erm what would they call it
S0663	well it be a glider wasn't it but i don't really think
S0662	i suppose it be well what be they make of i mean why do they i suppose they perhaps there must be a reason they have to be like that cos otherwise i mean they it's just like wood isn't it you know that would just crash i don't know but anyway he be a a a the pilot of the i think that be the idea why you buy the picture for him really wasn't it because of that
S0663	yes well it be a picture of the aeroplane the erm
S0662	that pull it the one that pull it
S0663	yeah yeah not the not the lancaster bomber the erm oh my goodness why can't i think of the name off the top of my head

S0662	they take
S0660	the the the story of how how it go be that they they battle these kind of harsh land you know and carve out america but really it be all do for them cos the native americans already have the land under control and all the crop the native americans already have it already

S0661	it's set in the
S0660	yeah it's set in like kind of
S0661	first world er no not first world war like eighteen hundreds
S0660	in america so when
S0661	civil war
S0660	the civil war yeah
S0662	mm
S0660	so the there's the french and the americans and the
S0661	french be over there they're
S0660	and the native americans
S0661	confederate
S0661	yeah
S0660	and erm and it's about so leonardo dicaprio's the main character and he have a mix race son cos he fell in love with a native american be she a princess be be she a chief's daughter or something no she wasn't
S0661	dunno don't think so
S0660	but he fell in love with this this isn't in the film storyline this be in the past
S0663	this be the history of the yeah the backstory
S0660	yeah erm so he's get he's get like a teenage son who's mix race and leonardo dicaprio be part of a group of americans who be who be just erm out in the wilderness hunt animals for their skin
S0663	oh
S0660	for the furs and that's
S0661	pelt
S0660	the pellets
S0661	do they call it
S0663	pelt
S0660	pelt that's it so they're just try to do that but at the same time they're constantly on the run well try not to erm get catch by native americans because they're just they're just they're they're the chief of this tribe be look for his daughter she's be kidnap and so the whole throughout the whole film this chief be look for his daughter and they're just savagely attack whether it's the french or the americans anyone that
S0663	anybody come from
S0660	and whilst look for his daughter you can imagine the chief's daughter like she's daughter like she's like the the most important
S0663	mm
S0660	woman in the tribe
S0663	yeah
S0660	so they're just try to hunt for the for the for the pelt and then erm leonardo dicaprio get maul by a bear and it's just
S0663	oh i think this be the thing i've hear about the bear maul be be it
S0660	it's the scariest thing isn't it
S0661	yeah yeah really scary
S0660	and the bear nearly kill him
S0660	and it's it's quite gory actually the special effect that they've get now be amaze
S0661	yeah
S0660	like it's you'd think it be real
S0660	like
S0663	cos just recently there be there be somebody who escape a bear maul
S0660	really
S0663	yeah and they have a a phone in and they be discuss it erm on the radio they be they have a whole half an hour as erm i think he's must've jeremy vine erm maybe anyway this this guy have i don't quite know what it be but they be discuss what you should do if you be attack or chase by a bear because you bear the bear can run faster than you
S0660	no
S0663	and what what somebody say be well as long as you can as long as you can run faster than whoever you're with you're alright that be obviously a bite of a joke
S0663	but yes
S0663	erm but it be really and one of the things be be you suppose to shout i think you're suppose to shout at it don't try and run cos they they can outrun you they can climb tree erm make yourself as big as you can which be not not not easy and shout i think be yeah shout at it
S0660	oh my god
S0663	i think that be
S0660	i dunno what i'd do i'd just freeze
S0663	or bear spray that be the other thing you have you don't go without your bear spray
S0663	think that's it
S0660	america's so scary isn't it like there be things in america that can kill you we're so lucky in this country
S0661	predators
S0662	mm
S0663	that we just have
S0660	there's mountain lions in america
S0661	yeah
S0663	yes yeah
S0660	stag that could kill you
S0663	well maybe they have a erm a a a what do you call the you know what do you call the store in the the outback what do you call the general store or whatever probably have a shelf full of or have bear spray
S0660	yeah
S0663	lion spray
S0660	yeah
S0663	spray
S0660	you need it
S0663	whatever yeah but it be kind of yeah
S0660	you're safe in new zealand there's only flightless bird
S0661	yeah
S0663	yeah
S0660	nothing's gonna attack you
S0663	yeah you could be peck a bite but you know
S0661	might pull your car to piece
S0660	yeah
S0663	yeah
S0660	so so leonardo dicaprio get maul by a bear and then he get find by his crew in oh but before that happen his camp get they get they get drive out of their camp by the native americans and only a few of them survive like they lose thirty men so so that's why they're they're they're not near their camp that's why there's a bear they be they be safe in their camp but they've get drive out and like load of them be injure and stuff and so he get find
S0661	mm
S0660	by his crew and he's you'd you'd you'd think that they be just like i don't know put him out of his misery because he's that mess up he can't even talk because his throat's be all
S0660	it's it's really gruesome
S0661	cos he he's suppose to be he's their guide because he
S0660	he's the only one who know
S0661	he know the area
S0660	know his way around because he live with that native american girl for so long
S0663	oh right okay oh he know the he know
S0660	he learn off the native americans and he can speak the language and everything
S0661	so they they need him to get out alive
S0663	so they patch him up
S0660	they patch him up
S0661	they they carry him
S0660	but then but then so his son who's mix race he get a give a lot of grief by some of the other crew mat they're really racist towards him
S0660	because obviously they don't like native americans because they're constantly be like attack by them
S0661	attack
S0660	erm so leonardo's just try to look after his son all the time
S0663	mm
S0660	and there's this one guy who's play by tom hardy who's just nasty isn't he he's like the leader the the support erm character
S0661	ruthless
S0660	he's so ruthless and he just doesn't care and he just want his money because they're all get pay large amount of money to be out in the wilderness get these pelt and that's all he care about and he he's just say like should we just like kill him and everyone's like we we can't leave him
S0663	we need him we yeah
S0660	so they're just carry him he can't even talk his all his they have to stitch him up there and then
S0663	oh
S0660	because his back be just like
S0660	open can you imagine
S0663	oh no
S0660	can you imagine get attack by a bear like that's how strong they be
S0663	oh yeah er well they'd normally kill wouldn't they
S0660	yes but the
S0662	this wasn't erm in the oscars be it
S0660	yeah
S0661	yeah yeah
S0662	i think so cos people be comment there's er there's something about the racism or something be there
S0660	yeah yeah
S0662	and also somebody else comment in the paper about how rich he be he have say the wrong thing have he or something
S0663	who leonardo dicaprio

S0662	well you know i mean
S0663	when he be in titanic he must've be
S0662	yes yes
S0663	a little lad
S0662	so time's go on
S0663	yes
S0662	they be say how rich he be i've forget how many millions or billions or whatever yeah
S0661	could be a lot quite rich yeah he's never he's never win an oscar though
S0663	but it's highly recommend then
S0660	yeah it be very good

S0663	yeah
S0661	it's worth it though
S0660	it's really it's quite like dreamy and there's a lot of go back in time and come forward because he's so mess up
S0663	yeah
S0660	after he get attack there's a lot of hallucinate and a lot of kind of like dream and visions and stuff back to cos his cos his native american wife like erm at the start you realise that she's not around anymore like something happen to her

S0660	like so there's he's always kinda dream of her and she's always just around and she's quite like fairylike isn't she
S0661	yeah yeah
S0660	it's it's almost like he's try not to die but if he do die he'd be back with he'd be reunite with his wife so

S0663	oh
S0660	love amy winehouse
S0663	yeah
S0660	but it's cos the film have the film's really affect her
S0663	oh
S0660	i be like well mum just listen to the music and just remember that when she be make the music she be really happy
S0661	oh
S0663	yeah
S0660	cos that's what she love do she be like oh right i'll try
S0663	mm very talented such a waste and and be we we be speak about this erm what's it call the twenties where people die
S0660	twenty seven
S0663	twenty seven cos it be jimi hendrix
S0661	kurt cobain
S0663	kurt cobain
S0661	janis joplin
S0660	jim morrison
S0663	yeah and all these people who die young age twenty seven that
S0660	something happen in your brain when you're twenty seven like part like specifically and
S0662	you've grow up
S0660	yeah but your brain actually change
S0663	do it
S0660	yeah
S0663	it's a physical change
S0660	yeah and then if if your cycle it i read load about it a few years ago and i can't quite remember now
S0661	be it plasticity
S0660	yeah
S0661	in your brain start to
S0660	but if you're at a stage in your life where you feel quite turbulent anyway
S0661	mm
S0660	because at twenty seven it's a funny age cos some people be get marry and have kid and some people be really do well in their career at that age
S0663	mm
S0660	and then if you if you don't quite fit into any of that and everything around you
S0663	if you see other people and you feel as though you've not achieve a lot
S0660	yeah you're at quite an unstable
S0663	mm
S0660	it's quite an unstable time plus that change in your brain and then i think be creative as well and all cos all these creative people that die when they be twenty seven
S0663	yeah
S0660	they be at a stage in their career where they be be force into areas force in a direction they didn't wanna go
S0660	like
S0661	yeah
S0660	kurt cobain he be might they be like number one in the world and he never want to be that famous so he wasn't able to make the music he want to make anymore
S0663	cope with it yeah
S0660	same with amy winehouse she be force to carry on go on tour and she couldn't get back in the studio and do what she love which be just write songs and the same with jimi hendrix he couldn't play his guitar for a week or something around the time that he die because he be like in between flats be that right be like in between flats be that right he be like in between flats and his guitar wasn't with him and all he want to do be just
S0661	not sure
S0663	play
S0660	be by himself and play his guitar and he couldn't
S0663	so there there's and mm it's very interest erm but it's very very sad
S0660	yeah yeah
S0661	yeah
S0663	i can't kind of compute the fact that these poor people have just
S0660	couldn't
S0663	cease to live
S0660	yeah
S0663	and and the talent and what be we say waste talent and waste live it's just really sad isn't it
S0660	yeah it be really sad
S0663	and then terry wogan die this morning and i know he be at the other end of the spectrum but i just think it's such a sad thing and we be talk about it and
S0661	yeah
S0660	oh how's he die then
S0663	he have cancer they say just a short battle with cancer
S0660	another one another one
S0663	yes well he he be he be
S0662	cos he didn't do children in need this time do he
S0663	he didn't present children in need last november
S0662	which apparently hear somebody say to me that be the one thing that be erm the most important to him
S0663	to him and that be kind of very last minute because didn't dermot o'leary stand
S0662	think so
S0663	in i think for him
S0662	oh
S0663	and there be there be lot of people say oh you know we're miss him do it but
S0662	he work for a bank didn't he in in erm
S0663	in ireland
S0662	in ireland yeah
S0663	well he be just such a lovely man and he be just so entertain and so amuse and just he be just erm
S0662	he wasn't one that would get on your nerve like a lot of them you think oh crumb you know
S0663	not at all no he be so easy to listen to and
S0662	mm
S0663	yeah very sad
S0662	mm
S0663	cos he cos he be i be think something make me think about him the other week i be think about him i don't know what make me think i don't know but i be think about him and think how good he be and
S0662	mm
S0663	then sad news this morning i think no cos he be still present on radio two he still have a programme on a sunday that he do and that be
S0662	mm
S0663	good it be like that richard madeley be then he's not my favourite richard madeley
S0662	no he's not my favourite but i read a little piece he's stand in for somebody and whoever be write the article it be only a little comment something about erm you know commentate how good how good he be and how he let people think it might've be a radio programme and he let people get their point over properly he doesn't cos a lot of them you know they interview them they they do chip in don't they and even on radio four who be suppose to be you know what they do erm occasionally i just listen in the morning and i think you know you're just you've just ask him the question and now he's try to answer and you're chip in and just the other one say if you let me finish my point you know don't they just some of them do but
S0663	they do do that
S0660	and they and they try and pre empt a lot
S0662	yeah
S0660	sometimes
S0662	yeah
S0660	er it's usually when the interviewer be they're not just a journalist be they they're a tv radio personality themselves
S0662	mm yeah
S0663	well like i well i would just say jonathan ross because er i don't like jonathan ross
S0662	no
S0663	and i just think he's so full of himself and usually when he talk to people
S0660	yeah
S0663	he he try to interview them but to me he make it about himself and i just think
S0660	yeah
S0663	you know you're just too egotistical i think he be but
S0661	mm
S0663	and other people may disagree but he's not not one of my favourites
S0660	yeah a lot of them be like that though i find erm lauren laverne i don't know if you know who she be but she
S0663	no
S0660	she's do a lot of stuff on channel four but she's get a radio show on six music she's big into her music
S0663	oh
S0660	she use to be in a band when she be a teenager so
S0663	right okay
S0660	erm but i find when she interview band and musicians she she'll ask a question but she'll kind of pre empt the answer as well and it's almost like she's insert her intelligence and it's like could it be it that you do this this rah rah rah and be it because of this and they'll be like
S0663	oh
S0660	no not at all like you just need to ask
S0660	ask
S0663	that they actually speak up for themselves and say
S0660	yeah
S0661	some lead question yeah
S0663	oh
S0660	lead question that's what they do
S0662	yeah but somebody must think that it's okay cos they keep if they keep employ her i'm not mean it's her fault but
S0660	yeah yeah
S0662	if they keep employ her then it somebody's wrong aren't they you know if they aren't if they
S0660	they probably get the rat so that's all they care about isn't it the boss
S0662	i suppose yeah
S0660	get the listeners
S0663	but be it about that radio presenter or
S0662	well
S0663	whatever's personality be
S0662	yeah
S0663	so i don't know i mean what can i say
S0662	people like it or they don't like it
S0663	yeah so therefore they
S0662	mm well that's the thing with all of us really isn't it you know we could like or dislike the same person yeah but
S0660	yeah
S0662	you think why don't they like them there's nothing wrong them and somebody else
S0663	well it's just it's just about whether you gel or not
S0662	yes
S0663	and it's like with just through life there be people you like and people you don't like and that's just
S0662	mm
S0663	how it be and i i use to say this quite a lot we can't like everybody all the time but
S0662	mm
S0663	you know you have to be at time erm just take a step back and be professional and think right well i don't like them but i've get a job to do so
S0662	mm
S0661	mm
S0663	just
S0662	mm and then i always think i wonder how long the erm you know before they before they come out of the green room shall we say how many question do the do the celebrity or whatever be allow to sort of say i don't want to talk about my marriage don't want to talk about my divorce and you're not to mention my mother or whatever it might be don't they
S0663	well there probably be quite a bite of that because don't want to be
S0662	well they have to do that because some of it's not nice i suppose or not to their credit so
S0663	well not only that but it's too personal and and journalists will just probe and probe won't they
S0663	and they'll ask them any personal thing
S0660	mm yeah
S0663	cos nowadays there doesn't seem anything that's
S0662	that they can't get to
S0660	well it depend what the dynamic be doesn't it if it's a super super famous person like leonardo dicaprio he can turn down any interview he want cos he's already load so his manager will say we're not talk about this we're not talk about this we're not talk about this and the tv show will just be like yeah okay cos they're just happy to have leonardo dicaprio on cos it will get the rat
S0661	mm
S0663	absolutely
S0660	but where if if if it's someone who's quite unknown and just want to get on tv to publicise themselves then they've not get as much of
S0662	yeah
S0660	clout
S0662	yeah yeah
S0663	they can't turn round and say you will not ask me these question cos they kinda like well we're not have you on then
S0660	they'll just say well we won't have you on there
S0663	yeah but leonardo dicaprio could just say no i all i want to talk about be my new film
S0660	yeah
S0663	and they would say yeah yeah yeah that's fine you can talk about whatever you want
S0661	mm
S0660	yeah
S0663	we'll have you
S0660	they're just so happy
S0663	ah
S0660	to have him
S0661	yeah
S0663	well that's another thing about terry wogan because he have he use to do the interview didn't he on television and i he use to do what do they call it what be his like michael parkinson do terry wogan do didn't he as well as do blankety blank cos i'd forget about blankety blank
S0662	well terry wogan do a children's thing first didn't he
S0663	i don't know what he do first but he do do an he be an interviewer wasn't he on television he do
S0661	ring a bell
S0663	yeah he do
S0662	yeah i can't just remember
S0663	and then cos i remember him do be he the first one that do blankety blank cos les dawson do it for a bite
S0662	i don't know
S0663	i seem to remember terry wogan
S0662	yes
S0663	and les dawson and i can't really remember after that
S0662	no i don't know
S0661	right shall we er
S0663	but yeah
S0661	head off
S0660	yeah nice and warm here though
S0661	it be isn't it
S0663	you could just nod off
S0661	we've just be in the rain all day in car park
S0660	yeah
S0663	in and out of cars and
S0663	yeah
S0660	i'm just really hungry
S0661	yeah
S0663	do you do what do what have and buy then by the by the way you know
S0661	er a nearly new 308 peugeot
S0663	oh right be that one with a er a like an estate
S0661	yeah i think so
S0663	for the dog
S0661	yeah yeah
S0663	right okay oh right okay cos they be after a qashqai weren't they but have they change their mind about that
S0661	yeah i think they've go lower and longer
S0662	a what a what
S0663	a it's it's it's a nissan qashqai it's like a a sort of four wheel four by four four wheel drive
S0661	four by four
S0662	a nissan
S0663	yes yeah cos nissan and honda be the two most reliable
S0662	yeah
S0663	make that's the
S0662	yeah
S0663	the the thing but apart from well certain cars erm they don't always have the design that you're look for
S0662	no
S0663	but they be look at well they've for a long time be interest in a qashqai but obviously they've they've go for something else a 308 so
S0662	but it's still a four by four
S0663	no no no no this be
S0662	oh
S0663	like an i would call it an estate car so that that's my perception of what what you'd call it
S0662	oh right
S0663	do do what they do with 's old car then cos weren't you contemplate that at some point or do say oh it's
S0661	erm think about it but again it's a bite more expensive to run cos it's a bigger engine
S0663	be it what be it
S0661	it's a one point four
S0663	oh right okay
S0661	so it's cost more to tax and
S0663	mm
S0661	erm
S0662	what make be that that he's get
S0663	peugeot
S0661	that's a peugeot 307
S0662	oh he's get a peugeot yeah mm
S0663	so a 308's a bite bigger than what they have do they say
S0662	mm
S0663	it's a bite bigger
S0661	yeah a 308 or a 3008 i dunno the the number isn't very logical at peugeot but yeah it be bigger
S0663	it be bigger cos they do a lot of travel up the
S0662	i be go to say yeah they'd probably take that into account if er i mean they be buy it or something
S0663	they do a lot of travel ah
S0662	and you've get to go a long way you you know it's better if you have get a more comfortable car i suppose if you do
S0661	yeah
S0662	do a lot of distance eh
S0661	yeah
S0663	and have they do lot of research or
S0661	yeah i think so they've be to test drive a few different ones
S0663	yeah right
S0661	over the past couple of weeks
S0663	mm
S0662	mm cos it's a big decision really isn't it you know
S0663	well it's a massive investment isn't it it's the next
S0661	mm
S0663	investment down from
S0662	well you hope you've not do the wrong thing that's it isn't isn't it you
S0661	yeah
S0663	thing be if you buy from a a garage i'm say a garage a you know professional car dealer person or whatever then you have some sort of warranty don't you
S0662	yeah
S0660	they they're usually between three and six months
S0663	mm
S0660	and a lot of them will make sure you've get a new mot on it as well
S0663	so it i think that's kinda quite important isn't it
S0662	yeah
S0663	plus i know i've mention before cos you kinda get the aa or the rac to do like a a check on a car for you you can actually pay them to do it and that i think if you're invest such a lot of money it might be worth pay for that service if you and just just to check it out i don't know cos these days it's it's different i mean years ago you have you could read in fact be it on what car or be it what car where you can read a whole thing all about the what to look for when you're look at cars and what to check out and all the rest of it and
S0661	yeah
S0663	whether the mileage have be clock and such like so
S0661	you get these er they're call a hpi check now
S0663	oh yes so that they're not hire purchase so that they're not
S0661	no it's the check on
S0662	that's
S0663	oh
S0661	on all this company collect all data from all different place to check for things like have it be in an accident have it be
S0662	mm
S0663	ah
S0661	er have the mileage be clock and all that kinda stuff and just problems
S0663	but it's also because it's really important that there's no finance outstanding on the car
S0661	yeah all that stuff yeah
S0663	that's really important cos
S0663	otherwise they can come and repossess it from you even though
S0663	that that that's a horrible thing to to and and
S0662	yeah
S0663	i would
S0661	yeah
S0663	imagine that most cars be actually buy on finance if you think about it
S0663	although if somebody take out a personal loan from a bank
S0663	and spend it on a car that's a different thing but if it
S0662	yeah
S0663	if you've take finance
S0661	yeah
S0663	out for a specific vehicle then
S0661	where the car's
S0662	and i mean all these thieve and everything they
S0663	yeah
S0662	everything's go so erm i dunno how can i say don't know what you can call it but
S0663	corrupt
S0662	well yeah and also clever you know they they find ways of get round all the things don't they
S0661	yeah
S0662	whether it's your phone or what the hell it be you know that's why i suppose it's good when they do make certain laws about certain things specially things like cars and things that you're buy cos you don't know do you
S0663	well they could well they could be so dangerous couldn't they you know if somebody's
S0662	mm
S0663	do something to make a car okay when it's not okay then it's
S0662	but do you remember us we use to go to didn't we on road there
S0663	you do yeah
S0662	yeah we use always get the rovers from from there and where i get that you know that little purple rover
S0663	yeah
S0662	from them
S0663	yeah
S0662	and i remember the chap that we when we the one that we generally saw an older bloke and i remember him say to me well if you have that one he say erm it'll cost you a bite more because of the er alloy wheel i didn't even know what alloy wheel be in my mind you know and it and i and i think well fancy try to put you off just because to me it didn't mean very much but i think that be in the days when people be pinch cars perhaps more you know
S0663	steel wheel
S0662	and be more how can i say not so not so maybe not so corrupt i don't know but like everything change
S0663	well you remember things er don't you i mean i remember have the spare wheel steal out of my erm
S0662	do you
S0663	mm well it be a peugeot actually when i think about it and it be it be actually when i be do tupperware and it be tupperware
S0661	yeah i remember that it be in a cage on the bottom of the car
S0663	yeah absolutely
S0662	when you what
S0663	somebody when i be do tupperware it be a tupperware car and they they have it be in a cage underneath as just say and somebody actually steal a spare wheel and
S0661	and another time someone put a machete through your roof thing
S0663	that be the worst one that be a fiat punto
S0662	mm
S0663	and i be work in a certain area i better not say where it be and erm yeah there be somebody come with a a machete and it put it through the roof through the bonnet and smash the back window
S0662	really
S0663	mm you remember
S0662	no i don't
S0663	cos i have to scoop all this glass i cut my hand scoop glass off to drive home with the wind whistle through the car because there be it it have have the window smash and and they have to put a whole new think it be only cos it be a new car that that it be worth repair otherwise cos they they'd miss the engine i think cos the engine would start when he'd go through the bonnet it have miss like vital organs as it be a human be but the through the roof it have to have a whole roof on it because it have go through the roof and roof line and
S0660	why do they do that
S0663	well complete nutcase because somebody have witness it from across the road and hadn't go out i don't blame them why would you why would you why would go and say excuse me you with the machete
S0662	but do they report it
S0663	erm i don't know if they do i think they they admit see it later on or i don't know who call the police but police come and there be kind of
S0662	yeah
S0663	i be absolutely horrify you can imagine can't you what someone yeah it be a guy with a machete
S0662	yeah yeah
S0663	and they be what seriously
S0661	oh yeah
S0663	okay mm
S0662	so you wouldn't have to pay tupperware would pay would they
S0663	well they would i mean i have to pay the excess though because the
S0662	do you
S0663	you know yeah because it it be part of the thing if you have a claim that you have to pay the excess
S0662	yeah yeah
S0663	so it be something like seventy five pound at the time but
S0660	mm
S0663	i mean that's go up
S0661	wow
S0663	considerably hasn't it
S0662	sure it have remember you know where sort of sainsbury's be now
S0663	mm
S0662	remember we use to park behind the old shop there along well not the old shop school road and that be where we use to everybody park it be sort of open and don't think we pay anything
S0663	i've now get very hazy memories of that cos i can't
S0662	don't think we pay anything cos we'd shop and then cut through
S0663	mm
S0662	between the street between the shop
S0663	mm mm
S0662	to this car park and i remember be in there one day and meet a girl woman that i know that live quite near nearby me in place and she say my car's disappear and she be she all she have you know she'd just do her shop and go back to her i suppose she couldn't believe you know that her car
S0663	it have it have go
S0662	have just go you know i of course i never ever find out what happen but
S0660	suppose they be easier to steal then weren't they
S0662	they be
S0661	happen to one of dad's car yeah
S0663	yeah
S0661	we we go to the library in and then we be i remember walk up and down the street and it be like i'm sure i park it here a few more time and it be just like well it's go

S0660	they be easier to get into weren't they
S0660	and start hot wire
S0663	yeah
S0660	but they're not as

S0661	mm
S0662	what what a surprise that you want a special colour
S0663	would you like to fancy that what a surprise what a surprise

S0663	apple don't make this colour anymore so would you like to look at it
S0661	mm mm
S0663	oh here you go
S0661	it's very nice
S0660	blingy
S0663	erm so when i go in it be apparently a problem transfer the number from a standard size sim to a nano sim
S0661	really
S0663	to a tiny sim card
S0661	mm
S0663	and we go through all these little different whatevers he ring and ring different part of vodafone
S0661	mm
S0662	well it doesn't er
S0663	no
S0662	mean much to me apart from the colour what colour be that mushroom
S0663	it's it's gold
S0662	pink gold oh
S0663	but i get the case erm and a in charger an in car sorry charger and a screen protector for ten quid as well and i that's such a good deal i'm only pay i'm i'm say i'm only pay i be pay ten fifty a month and vodafone even say oh yes well you can't stay on that that's a half price deal your ten fifty at the end of your contract
S0663	we'll go up to twenty one pound
S0661	what
S0663	so for me to keep the the deal that i be on it be on it would've double in price
S0660	oh
S0663	so i go to carphone warehouse i get a new phone and i'm now pay seventeen pound a month to vodafone
S0660	yeah
S0663	crazy be it not
S0660	yeah it be
S0661	that's good how long's that for
S0663	two years and i'm quite happy with not have the cos this be no the latest model this be several model ago
S0662	oh
S0663	and i'm quite happy to have the several model ago cos i really don't care erm
S0661	how be you get on with it then compare to your samsung
S0663	actually okay i'm still get use to it but then because i hadn't really use one before but i quite like it cos i want it to pair up with my computer and i want to be able to take a photograph and for it go up to ipad this be just me think
S0661	mm
S0663	and and sound as though i know what i'm do erm so there be things that i want to do that i couldn't do on my samsung
S0661	have you get it all set up then
S0663	erm more or less i think but 's help me with it cos he's get the same phone so he be able to do that
S0661	oh right
S0660	that's good
S0663	but the hardest thing poor man be thumb print because i be try to do that be hard for him i'm sure
S0663	his patience be test severely
S0661	mum you couldn't press your thumb on the screen
S0663	he be very he be very patient i think this be actually quite a test he's he be laugh and he just laugh cos it wouldn't i couldn't get cos he be say oh press it don't press it now press it no not as
S0663	and then i have to
S0661	oh god
S0663	to have you ever set up a thumb print
S0661	on my phone i have
S0663	yeah and be it dead easy
S0661	well well mine's a mine's a fingerprint on the back
S0663	oh right well i could've have
S0661	see that thing
S0663	oh oh okay but you do it and then it it keep fill it in when you'd see the little thing
S0661	yeah you have to move your finger round it
S0663	yeah
S0661	it get all your print
S0663	yeah but i wasn't do it with in the right place or with the right amount of pressure
S0661	go doo doo doo doo doo
S0663	yeah good lord do that take age
S0663	so eventually now that be the hardest bite
S0661	wow
S0663	once that be set up it be fine so yeah i've be do
S0660	the thumb print's for security they can use your own thumb print so the phone know who's use it so someone else can't do it
S0662	oh wonderful
S0660	it have to be 's thumb print
S0660	isn't it clever
S0661	like mission mission impossible
S0662	sound clever i don't understand but
S0663	it be clever but once once it's be set up by by the goons or whatever by this guy erm yeah but it do it do work and yeah i do like it i like it but it's also peculiar cos you get use to a whole different thing and i be use to my other phone and i do like my other phone i've get nothing against it and i can set the alarm and i could do all sort of other things
S0663	well that's the thing because it's it be easier i think that be an easier one to do
S0661	oh yeah
S0663	so it's
S0661	they're suppose to be easier to use
S0663	it be
S0661	cos you can't really change the way that they work cos android phone and samsung do their own version google do a version all of the same android operate system
S0663	right
S0661	apple ios you can't really customize it other than like change your background or whatever
S0663	yes well all i
S0661	suppose to be simpler
S0663	it be simple i think for a simple person but
S0663	it's it's i've change my ringtone but i i want to put a song on it i say how can i put a song on this and say well you can download it from your itunes i haven't get any itunes
S0663	so i say what do i do if i want to just put a a so i've get to apparently download a song that i want and then i can do it but i think that's another project for another day it's a little bite too painful too involve
S0660	yeah take your time
S0661	just sing it into the recorder if you want
S0663	that would be awful
S0663	imagine that ring out like
S0661	like abba
S0663	wave away
S0660	you could do that though you could put your your favourite song on your cd player and record it
S0663	oh
S0660	that way the i won't be as good quality but
S0661	it'd be bloody awful quality
S0660	it would be alright wouldn't it
S0660	and just record it and you could use the record for your ringtone
S0663	mm
S0660	and you don't have to download it
S0662	so what song be you go to choose
S0663	it be coldplay it's my one of my very favourite songs viva la vida
S0660	duh duh duh duh di di di
S0663	it's
S0660	be it that one di di duh duh duh duh di di di
S0663	yes
S0661	yeah can record it
S0661	get a record we've get a record there
S0663	would you like to sing
S0663	oh dear so i think yeah cos i just kinda think yeah i'll have a proper song i won't just have the bell or whatever it be whistle
S0663	seashore
S0661	apple song isn't it
S0663	well there's several
S0661	oh the phone
S0663	there's a whole list i've i've go through the list and there be nothing i particularly fancy i think i don't fancy any of those twenty different ringtones that they're offer me
S0663	i think i'll have my own so yeah
S0661	right shall we make track then
S0660	alright

S0662	let's have a look
S0660	i've start my collection
S0663	so be you be you do this as a project or be you do it to sell or
S0660	think so
S0663	mm
S0660	i'm not sure what i'm do
S0660	this be another one
S0663	oh wow
S0660	they're just rough
S0663	yeah
S0660	rough erm quite crude er ones but yeah it's all it's all it's all heat
S0663	well actually that's good cos you know what as well as the design though it would just you can coordinate something with your outfit can't you
S0660	mm yeah
S0663	somebody could say i have get this orange outfit and i want a ring to go with it
S0660	mm yeah it's it's only orange and clear cos that's what scrap that's what colour the scrap be
S0663	mm
S0660	i'm just work scrap
S0663	mm
S0660	acrylic at the moment i don't wanna spend my money on stuff while i'm just do test but would you like to see
S0662	mm
S0660	this be one of them they're a bite futuristic i suppose they're make out of plastics
S0662	right
S0660	but er
S0662	these be your design
S0660	yeah do them last week
S0662	oh aren't you clever
S0660	and that's another one they're do use you can use heat
S0662	yeah to
S0660	to to to mould them
S0662	mould them mm mm
S0660	erm
S0660	cos i've cos i've get a new heat gun so they're quite sculptural i don't know where it's gonna go i don't know whether they're piece they're not i suppose i i don't think i'm aim at the commercial market
S0662	you don't want to be a
S0660	i i i just wanna make stuff that i think's interest
S0663	mm and different
S0660	at this stage
S0662	well lot of
S0660	i don't wanna i don't wanna no i don't wanna dampen i suppose i do need to
S0663	your creativity
S0660	i do need to make some money i know this but i think right now at this stage of my journey i don't think that's the important bite it's more important to be make interest innovative design
S0661	that's a point of residency isn't you're suppose to exhibit as one of the like the college's products that you
S0663	yeah
S0661	what you're do
S0660	they don't wanna see stuff that could sell in top shop
S0663	oh no
S0662	no no no
S0661	bite more bite more innovative
S0660	yeah
S0663	no well it's about erm your individual creativity
S0660	yeah
S0663	your individual design and mm mm
S0660	i've enjoy it so far anyway it's just
S0663	oh we should be out of here
S0660	i'm just every day i'm just like what be i do should i just get a normal job but i don't think i'd be happy with a normal job
S0663	just joy do and have the er
S0663	take the opportunity that you've get
S0660	yeah
S0663	and and just go with it and do
S0660	don't think about it
S0663	no
S0660	just do it
S0663	the chance
S0661	mm
S0663	cos if you go and say oh no i won't do that anymore i'll go and work full time wherever then you've lose that opportunity haven't you
S0660	yeah
S0663	so while you get the opportunity and just what do they say network or whatever and keep in touch with different designers and
S0662	mm
S0660	yeah
S0663	people that
S0660	i think after this residency i might i think i'm gonna i would like to go and intern for someone again
S0663	mm
S0660	but maybe someone at a different in a different area of design to maybe someone who's work on more of a
S0663	mm
S0660	not quite such a more art jewellery you know stuff that and learn about someone who's work with different materials and stuff and learn from them how to
S0663	mm
S0660	work with those materials
S0660	cos i don't really know anything about metal or that kind of thing i just know plastic right now
S0662	mm and there's always people who who like something different isn't there like things that be a one off you know
S0660	yeah
S0662	not like half a dozen on a stand in a shop sort of thing
S0661	mm
S0660	yeah some people only want to wear stuff like that don't they
S0663	mm
S0663	mm
S0660	there be a market for it
S0663	mm
S0662	yeah yeah i think so
S0660	cos if you make stuff that's too sellable then you end up be so bogged down with production of the same stuff
S0663	mm
S0662	yeah yeah
S0660	then i'd probably i'd be i'd feel like amy winehouse i wouldn't go to that extreme but
S0663	no
S0660	you know be force to just
S0662	yeah
S0660	make all this stuff over and over again where i'm not learn anything other than how to be a machine
S0663	or
S0663	you could if you find something commercial you get two halve to a week you could commercial make some money
S0660	yeah
S0663	other half creative
S0660	yeah
S0663	or whatever or whatever
S0660	other half work at the restaurant so there'd be three halve
S0663	well
S0661	yeah
S0660	can we change maths please so that i can have three halve
S0661	mm
