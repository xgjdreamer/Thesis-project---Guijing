S0687	there be space for it
S0689	part

S0688	and manage it as well
S0687	yeah
S0688	i suppose a pool's enough as well
S0687	a pool's expensive enough to keep on top of isn't it
S0688	yeah i think it's best to have a pool i'm sure that's a good sell point we wouldn't have choose it would we if it didn't have a pool
S0690	better get in it and use it then hadn't you

S0687	there's only you who hasn't be in
S0690	i only have a quick
S0689	a quick nap
S0690	a quick nap i dunno it's fine
S0687	a quick nap you be sleep for about two hours
S0690	don't know if be that long but whatever ooh
S0688	oh
S0687	ooh
S0690	crap that be close
S0687	he scrap himself then didn't he
S0689	no
S0688	i think he get
S0690	almost
S0688	the wheel
S0687	that be so close i would not risk that
S0688	i would not wouldn't wanna bring my
S0687	no
S0688	bmw up there
S0687	don't risk don't risk it
S0690	you're always
S0687	your audi
S0690	he obviously know what he's do
S0687	you wouldn't have make that on cos it's longer
S0688	mm i wouldn't have try
S0687	mm
S0688	he's obviously use to do it
S0687	mm yours be very nice i'd have have a smaller amount with some veg
S0690	do you bring the do you bring the anti bite cream i'm just get bite
S0687	you have it's in the erm not not not the repellent you've bring the itchy stuff
S0689	i'm just think right what what's the difference between ebola mosquito and a normal mosquito be it just a different like species of mosquito
S0687	i think some of them carry the disease like they have the infection themselves
S0690	yeah yeah they have yeah
S0689	so could we have ebola mosquitoes over here
S0687	oh he's
S0688	they say they be come to europe
S0687	be er be ebola carry by carry by mosquitos
S0689	it be isn't it
S0690	yeah
S0688	yeah
S0687	could we not
S0690	erm well no not quite actually
S0687	be there somewhere that we couldn't like completely like eradicate mosquitos
S0689	yeah
S0690	i think there be
S0687	like have mass gas
S0689	can i just say this right
S0690	yeah
S0689	if
S0687	but would we not kill like everything else
S0689	this be in my biology exam so i'm gonna have a little
S0687	go on
S0689	basically
S0690	right go on you first
S0689	they're do it at the moment where you can genetically modify mosquitoes
S0687	okay so that the
S0689	so that like the so that the female offspring have a thing a certain amount at like that basically the female offspring yeah female offspring
S0687	mm
S0689	die basically and they can't reproduce and you you can control the amount of
S0688	oh
S0689	like mosquitoes
S0687	that's clever
S0690	or become
S0689	so
S0690	infertile
S0688	so when the
S0689	yeah
S0688	when the when they hatch
S0689	so when
S0688	they won't live
S0687	they're infertile yeah
S0689	yeah so that mean if you release those into the wild they're gonna breed pass on those genes
S0687	and then it spread in the populous
S0689	yeah
S0688	oh
S0687	and so they're do that
S0689	that's what that's what my biology exam say whether it's true or not i don't know
S0690	yes
S0687	be they start to do that
S0690	yes
S0687	so how quickly would that start to work
S0689	well that be one of the question it be like why be this why be this bad and i say cos it could lead to eradication of mosquitoes cos if you can't if if there's all the females be be
S0687	i don't think mosquitoes do add anything to the food chain though do they i suppose they
S0689	i wouldn't like stuff like frog and
S0687	frog things like that they might eat them but
S0687	yeah bite more then yeah it's alright we've get
S0690	you have to be careful kind of don't you alter the biodiversity but but bill gate buy millions and millions of mosquito net and they take them to africa and then they turn them into bloody fish fish net
S0687	really
S0690	yeah
S0687	what i wouldn't have think a mosquito net would work as a fish net cos they're not very strong it's just like
S0690	i know but
S0687	film
S0688	what's that
S0687	bill gate buy millions of mosquito net take them to africa and they've use them as fish net
S0688	take a duck to water
S0690	yeah not everywhere but yeah
S0687	isn't it take a horse to water
S0689	duck water frog
S0687	take a duck to water and it could get in
S0688	swim i be think
S0687	a duck'd be a horse might not
S0690	but they have eradicate polio most place now haven't they
S0688	well it's make a comeback isn't it at some point
S0690	well
S0688	you know
S0690	well yeah in
S0688	in african countries
S0690	in northern nigeria it be actually cos the bloom taliban equivalent say it be western doctor kind of impregnate do you know something through medicine
S0687	like have a mass cull through a a disease
S0690	yeah
S0687	that be what the constant gardener be all about wasn't it they be the supposedly administer drug
S0689	thank you very much
S0687	thank you
S0687	to erm
S0689	ta
S0688	thank you
