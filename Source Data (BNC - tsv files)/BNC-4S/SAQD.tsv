S0012	yeah
S0152	as long as it's c and above not a problem so and they've get this rat system of one to four which in most place have one to four and she be she be get ones and twos in all her subject except for health and social care

S0012	yeah
S0152	but to have that down as a three
S0012	yeah
S0152	so do speak to about it erm and she say something and she say well they can't give her they can't give her two cos it's like ofsted criteria no it isn't
S0152	no it's not like ofsted criteria at all they can't give her satisfactory i say they can this be this be them say that you be not get to your lessons on time or you're not take the right equipment or you're not take the right
S0012	yeah
S0152	book or you're not enthusiastic enough and er er it you know it be like mm so when i go i saw the art teacher first over the moon
S0012	yeah
S0152	over the moon with
S0012	be she
S0152	really please with what she's do even in that short period of six seven weeks she have move a long way with what she's do
S0012	great
S0013	mm
S0152	so they be really please over the time just say she need to talk a little bite more and have that bite of confidence but that's not be it at the end of the day
S0012	no it's not no
S0152	she won't say things that unless she really have to
S0152	so then we go
S0012	unlike
S0152	yeah unlike then we go then we go to health and social care and the person we saw be also her form tutor sit down and please to meet you de de de de de all the bits and piece well what do you want to ask
S0152	and i ah i think you be suppose to be tell me what what's happen and then i will ask you
S0152	some question about it oh
S0152	the teacher this woman go oh like this
S0154	i'd be so
S0012	intimidate
S0152	intimate
S0154	by you i'd be like oh no
S0152	so it be like
S0154	don't hurt me
S0152	so it be like oh and she'd get the a piece of work in front of her from and i keep read no yellow folder on the top and i'm think it's sit in a yellow folder why have it get no yellow folder at the moment write on the top it's sit in a yellow folder so i so she's a bite like she say er there have be a change and she say that 's move quite nicely now and say and say some other things and be sit there and i go oh and she say but i'm you know i'm the form tutor and i'm also
S0012	yeah
S0152	the take one part of the health and so i say yeah erm i say oh you probably as her form tutor you would probably be aware that wasn't very happy at the start of the sixth form we be like whoosh over the top right and she go oh oh i say yeah the first three or four weeks of start she find it very difficult the change from do gcse have twelve weeks out of school because you finish
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	but you don't do anything
S0154	yeah
S0012	that's right
S0152	you've get to get back into that routine of work the level be different i say certain subject she just knuckle down and go with but she do find certain things difficult i say and one of those be actually this subject health and social care i say because from what from what i've be from the conversations i've have there seem to be mix message between the two members of staff
S0152	about what's require and what isn't require and
S0013	mm
S0152	stuff and of course as soon as you do that it's like no we we work together we we do all the bits and piece
S0012	yeah
S0152	no you don't sorry i don't fall that you know i know full well you weren't work cos cos you're two different people
S0012	yeah
S0152	and i'm i'm go from experience cos i've see it
S0012	yeah
S0152	so many time and i just go oh right okay i say well i say she sit down to do an essay a question she spend the time on it i say and i'm i'm aware there wasn't enough detail in it from the point of view that it be just one sentence answer i say but i do explain to her that it need to be more than one sentence answer because you need to be get as much detail in as you can and it's about jump through the hoop for the exam course and of course the teacher's go that's right you know you you've get to get the question you've get to answer them you've get to put as much detail in as possible i say and what didn't understand be the forty minutes of write a question where it's take her two and a half hours to answer the question cos she work on it and she yes she get a c she go from a u to a c but it take her two and a half hours to do it not forty minutes
S0012	yeah
S0152	i say so she didn't she you know there be a big learn curve there for her and it be like oh yeah yeah i say but you know i think she's happy i think she's happy now so can i just ask when you do the progress grade and she look enough to say why be you ask that question i say well i say cos i'm work on the basis that probably you do them round about four weeks ago
S0152	so there's take out get this week add half term i say and two weeks to get them out and ready for half term so all the stuff could be collate so i'm i'm work round about four weeks ago
S0013	yeah round about four weeks ago
S0152	i say if like four away from the seven that's only three three weeks into her start the course et cetera i say and therefore it fit in that she wasn't very happy
S0013	mm
S0152	in in your in your subject with what you're do oh well yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and it be like mm okay and then er when i'd go into the art cos we saw the art people first there be a member of staff that i know
S0012	oh really of course yeah
S0152	yeah and say she just star at you all the time cos she be over there with another group of parent
S0012	yeah
S0152	and i'm here with and i do say hello to her but she just star like she just star at me say i didn't see yeah she just star at you and then be say who be see next this this be for the film and psychology we're see mr mr and go oh okay that will be an interest one then if he remember
S0152	she say she say why i say it's because we employ him as an english and media study teacher at and i say and he only do a term because he couldn't cope and go back to where he come from which be sixth form
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know the type of thing i say and he be promise things and he didn't didn't get them promise him
S0012	yeah
S0152	er a max suite and things well he didn't get them basically
S0012	yeah
S0152	so he he and he couldn't deal with the students at the end of the day so he go there so i walk in and i'm think you haven't recognise me or you haven't you haven't clock

S0012	yeah
S0152	she's always like things like that
S0013	mm
S0152	so that's good i say the one that do concern would be the psychology and the understand he well she's do alright at the moment but we be gonna be do some write test et cetera and whether she's understand that and everything and i go okay i say and and he say and we're you know we're by christmas we'll be the coursework would have be do and then it's get it ready for the exam and you're think christmas be only five like six weeks away
