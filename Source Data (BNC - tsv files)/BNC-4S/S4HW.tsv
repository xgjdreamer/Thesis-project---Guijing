S0688	you say you be treat yourself
S0689	i know but i didn't go cos i figure i didn't wanna buy it because in two weeks the price might have go down i know
S0687	what game
S0689	i want uncharted it's call it's the final one
S0687	why would the price have go down in two weeks
S0689	don't know because sometimes like a couple of weeks after release you can get it for like twenty quid cheaper on ebay and that's what i be just look then
S0688	you're such a skinflint
S0687	skinflint i suppose he wouldn't have use it these two weeks would he so

S0687	i've tell you we'll get you back to tesco's as well as this
S0689	yeah i don't know i might just spend i don't know
S0687	you can do load over the summer and then the minimum contract they'll give you a week be seven hours
S0689	yeah
S0687	so you can do either do all either do seven hours at once on a saturday or do two even three and a half hours
S0688	he's still gotta you've gotta fill that form in and get to beyond
S0687	yeah yeah
S0688	haven't you
S0687	oh be this ready
S0689	oh oh right have you put some like sundried tomatoes on
S0688	yeah
S0689	can i not have the sundried tomatoes please
S0688	okay
S0690	thank you
S0687	so you could just get a contract for seven hours if they're give any
S0689	yeah
S0687	and then do load of overtime over the summer and then just in september when you go to college just drop down to two even a week or something
S0689	yeah

S0689	mm how do you do you get double time for overtime or
S0687	you get time and a half for sunday so sundays be good to work really cos you get over ten pound an hour i'll take you back when we get back
S0689	ten pound an hour that's not bad if i work like seven hours a week that's like seventy quid a week innit
S0687	well they'd give you they might it's whether they give you contract hours on a sunday but you could always take overtime there's always overtime

S0689	yeah
S0687	be you okay mum
S0688	fine watch the sunset
S0689	i don't i don't wanna be mean but i just i don't know er btec like btec er btec you know what i mean apart from like i dunno cos it's easy
S0688	well you know
S0689	do you know what i mean cos it's like it's a bite of a joke if like it's you know it's see as a bite of a joke isn't it like basically it be anyway at
S0688	do you have to go to university to be a midwife no probably not really
S0687	except you do now
S0688	well you do but i'm say do you need to too many people have go to university
S0687	yeah that's what i mean now it it mean
S0688	so
S0687	it mean a lot less now than it mean when you guy well you know when you guy be our age cos every like literally the majority of people have a degree now don't they so it mean a lot less which make it harder
S0688	so have do what suit him and like say he's earn now
S0689	no absolutely i'm say there's some fantastic btecs out there like i know ba do a great one where they they take you on after a level and you get a degree while you're work and they
S0687	like as an engineer
S0689	yeah as an engineer for ba
S0687	yeah
S0688	quite hard to
S0687	if you could get an apprenticeship like they be very competitive if you could get something like that where they're gonna pay for your degree and pay
S0689	absolutely yeah
S0687	you at the same time
S0688	you might as well do it
S0687	you're quids in you may as well do it
S0688	absolutely and you know the bite biggest criticism that employers have be that students aren't ready for work
S0687	don't have experience yeah the if they have experience of study but no actual work experience
S0688	like communication skills and
S0687	which be why like you know dad have a degree would have be enough to get him a job come out of uni but now it's not you have to have work experience as well and all sort of extra things
S0689	yeah
S0687	cos it's not enough
S0688	do this affect us
S0689	what
S0688	be this like the end of
S0689	it's not really
S0688	be it quarter finals after this
S0689	yeah
S0687	so what happen after this the top two from each board go through
S0689	yeah and play the so first we'll play first of another group i can't remember which we play
S0687	sorry say that again
S0689	so the third
S0687	so so england will play the first of another group
S0689	yeah which will probably be i dunno i think it's like portugal's group that we play against and then the second'll play against the second of that group then the first of another group will play against the first of another group
S0687	right and then what
S0689	and then they get smaller and smaller and smaller until it's the final
S0687	but what about why do the first of each group play the first of another group instead of the second
S0689	it's just the way it work
S0687	but then how do they decide then do do the winner of the two the two second play each other play a first or do you know what i mean
S0689	yeah it's a bite complex cos er it get more complex because there's all like playoffs where the thirds of group play each other and stuff it get really complex and i don't really know the ins and out of the euros to be honest with you
S0688	do you share one tea bag between these
