S0392	be you plan our return journey

S0391	one pound
S0397	yeah
S0393	that's not be it
S0391	that's excellent
S0397	but they stop at half past five even in the summer which as the little man say on the bus be a problem because if people want to stay for evensong which be sing nicely
S0392	do you remember the one
S0397	yes so people can't say if they need a lift back to the station
S0391	be there nothing else to the station

S0391	the bus's good value
S0392	yeah
S0391	one pound for the whole day
S0397	yeah
S0392	be it just a little mini bus
S0391	circular
S0397	it be a little circular mini bus
S0392	be it all above board or be it just a fellow on a bus
S0397	it's not like a school mini bus it's like a proper mini public transport mini bus
