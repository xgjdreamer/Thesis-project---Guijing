S0428	oh from the from the communist
S0505	yes it be a communist revolution yes
S0428	oh really
S0505	mm

S0478	okay so i'll offer the bake bean to pa
S0505	yeah yes i'm go to have ryvita and taramasalata and crisp and sausages
S0478	you can have what you like erm could you come and set the table for me please fairly soon
S0428	mm mm well i'll i'll go in a minute
S0478	oh you you've do that do you have a tea cup
S0428	you've just pick it up
S0478	oh sorry i must have take mine
S0428	i've never be i'd love to go to around there but i'd be too i don't know i think i'd be too scar to go now
S0505	well i'd be i wouldn't i notice it because i use to collect plant
S0428	yeah
S0505	and i have a big sort of plant collection press them and i'd take them into the and identify them and erm when i use to go out on his fieldwork cos he'd go along the stream look for snail and take sample of that and i'd help him a bite but then i'd walk on my own down the street and people would stop and talk to me quite a friendly way but then the erm africans er the driver for instance and one of the lab assistants you know say oh madam don't don't go walk on your own now it's not safe
S0428	mm so it change it use to be safe
S0505	it change and change yes and when there be at the other side of one of the game park be a hill that we call it be the black hill it be an old volcano one of the latest volcanos to go off and it be still more or less ash and the plant be just begin to climb up
S0428	oh wow
S0505	and and there be sort of semi circular track up it and you could climb right to the top and one way you look to kilimanjaro it be lovely
S0428	oh wow
S0505	and the other way you look right across kenya to mount it be actually super i'm i always use to go up
S0428	on your own
S0505	ah no not on my own use to when she be there use to climb up with me and and when they be both
S0428	little
S0505	both there use to sit in the car but never mind
S0505	and then er the last time i go be when i be sixty five and be visit so i say we must go and climb the black hill
S0428	mm mm
S0505	so we go out of the game entrance and then we go and we say we be go to climb this and they say oh you must take a guard with you
S0428	really
S0505	and they give us with a an african who didn't really want to come with an a k fourteen sling over his arm you know to guard us
S0428	cos it be that dangerous
S0505	and er well they say that it be that dangerous because er
S0428	i guess it's also like if something happen it would be on the news and they don't want any bad press
S0505	yeah no they didn't want that cos they be try to build up the tourist trade as well
S0428	and i guess now that's be totally
S0505	and it it be fairly dangerous cos it be one part where somalia come almost down right down like that
S0428	oh that's always be dangerous somalia
S0505	and you could look eh where they've always be raiders and thieve really they're always raid for cattle and goodness know what
S0428	well
S0505	and they be of course poach the animals in the game park it be do largely by the somalis and so we have to have this chap and so he say you're not go to climb up to the top be you you know he be only a sort of young boy so he say oh dear dear and he come up puff up the hill
S0428	ah
S0505	up after us he didn't want to come at all but he manage to get there and er we give him a drink of water and
S0428	sound alright
S0505	we sit there at the top
S0505	and we sit and admire the view for a bite and then we go down again
S0428	ah yeah like
S0505	but i think that it spoil it though cos before it be just you and africa and nobody else but to have a chap with a rifle you know
S0428	it's not quite the same
S0505	sling over his shoulder no no
S0428	i'm not sure where i would go in africa south africa i guess be safe
S0505	mm towns aren't safe they're very unsafe
S0428	really
S0505	mm
S0428	it's just so sad there's a whole continent that
S0505	yes i know it's all up and down and and south africa be really mediterranean it it doesn't remind you of africa when you go there you know
S0428	yeah i've i can't even imagine what africa's like you know
S0505	mm mm
S0428	i've be to morocco
S0505	mm mm it's not like that that i should think at all
S0428	but
S0506	well i've be to egypt and it's not like that
S0505	no no no no
S0506	no no no mm
S0505	oh it it it be lovely and but the the animals would break your heart you know
S0506	mm
S0428	what cos
S0505	because they're be poach and poach and poach and you drive along and there's dead rhino lie there you know hack to bits and and all this and the elephants sort of all back up and stand in ring you know look out with their head down
S0506	uhu
S0505	it's just not the same and and the game won't last i'm afraid
S0428	they're just not free the what
S0505	the game they don't realise what they're lose once the game plain of east africa be go the tourists won't want to go there anymore
S0428	yeah
S0506	mm
S0505	and all they can see them be be money money money you know and it's the it's the chinese and the japanese that will buy them
S0506	ah
S0428	what the rhinos and
S0505	the rhino horn cos they think it's an aphrodisiac so they use it as medicine
S0506	that's horrible though isn't it
S0505	and er the elephant tusk for ivory
S0428	but what do they make out of ivory these days
S0505	well they carve it and er sell it
S0478	figurines yeah
S0505	mm
S0478	erm there's cheese and erm bread and rice cake and ryvita and salad

S0505	erm the well there's a string of sort of volcanic hill which be quite quite big up
S0428	yeah
S0505	and then there's plain and then it gradually rise up from the coast to six thousand feet nairobi's six thousand feet

S0506	mm
S0505	so it's two hours
S0478	cos you're suppose to be there erm three hours beforehand so you're suppose to be there at eight thirty
S0428	well two hours
S0505	it say two hours yes
S0478	oh do it
S0505	yeah on on my eticket
S0478	be you sure
S0505	it say you may check in er yes it's two hours i think for
S0506	mm
S0478	i'm very surprise if it's
S0506	mm
S0505	i'll read it to you cos airlines send me a
S0506	i'm sure would have it read in her head
S0478	well always say three hours
S0505	no i wouldn't cos i haven't really look at the ticket
S0506	oh
S0428	two hours be fine
S0505	you know why should i
S0506	mm mm
S0478	i think you'll be leave early anyway because in case there's any problem on the m25
S0506	mm
S0505	see here it say dear sir or madam thank you for your email we have update your seat request but although we will do our utmost to ensure your seat request be meet we be unable to guarantee confirmation
S0478	but that's appal
S0505	isn't that awful because it be age ago that i book
S0478	yeah cos you be book in age ago for assistance on an aisle seat
S0505	yeah aisle seat yes
S0478	that's that's really not on that
S0505	we would like to advise you about the check in facility
S0428	i think they just they say that just in case like there's some reason why they can't it's like a get out clause
S0478	mm but actually didn't get a
S0506	oh yeah
S0478	ah well maybe if you've get erm assistance maybe it be two hours actually
S0505	you can you can you can check in online between forty eight hours and two hours prior to flight departure
S0478	yeah
S0506	mm
S0478	yeah but it doesn't tell you how long to go to the airport beforehand
S0505	no no no this doesn't no though if you can check in two hours prior to flight departure i imagine you don't
S0428	yeah two hours will be fine
S0505	provide you're not you wouldn't get there absolutely
S0478	you might get a seat you'd get one of those ones that the air host erm have to sit in
S0506	mm
S0505	well i should tell them i'd rather stand
S0505	than go in the middle of an aisle the middle of a line
S0428	oh it's horrible when you're in the middle isn't it
S0505	mm yeah because
S0478	i you just need to burst into tear
S0505	mm
S0478	i think that would probably be quite powerful
S0506	mm
S0478	that's what i'd do
S0505	mm mm yes well i i know how to say and but i i just can't get in a a
S0478	no well no well it's actually the truth
S0505	if it's a night flight you get almost straight into the night and
S0478	yeah yeah
S0428	mm
S0505	and and if you i want to go to the loo you have to step over somebody else's you know legs i couldn't do that
S0428	yeah
S0506	mm mm
S0505	it be terrible fortunately i have a very nice chap next to me a malaysian and he always say oh that's alright you know i'll get up and he get up he have to completely ah undo his things and
S0428	but i think you have to anyway like whenever i'm you have to ask people to move
S0505	mm but i've i need to er stretch my legs
S0428	yeah
S0505	because otherwise they get
S0506	well so do i
S0505	my knees get very crook up
S0506	yeah mm
S0505	you know so i have to go a couple of time during the night which be
S0478	we'll be eat at seven o'clock
S0505	right
S0478	i mean it may be that because you're in the economy class there be fewer aisle seat actually
S0505	oh there be yes and it's only
S0478	but i mean they should have reserve the ones
S0505	but they should have reserve it cos i book
S0478	for a disable person yeah they should
S0505	mm i i book
S0428	what do you mean there be fewer aisle seat
S0505	well it's only there's only about five row
S0478	because 's go economy plus
S0428	yeah but there's probably the ratio of aisles
S0478	oh the ratio will be well no it's not because there be fewer seat in a row so the ratio's different actually
S0505	mm yeah mm yeah so there's no the five seat in the middle
S0478	no
S0505	it's four seat in the middle
S0478	four and then be there a three at the side it's probably two be it
S0505	mm mm mm
S0428	so there's probably more aisle seat per number of seat
S0478	yes
S0505	mm
S0478	but
S0505	yes but they say tell they'd all go when he try to book me a get my seat in they say oh all the aisle seat have go
S0478	mm
S0505	but when i get off off the plane and i i say to the woman who have help me you know to a little van to get my luggage i say she say be you alright on the and i say no it be very difficult on the flight cos i be put in the middle of a row and she say oh you shouldn't have be it it's it's by our our laws that anybody who go wheelchair have to be put in an aisle seat
S0478	yeah yeah yeah
S0506	oh mm
S0428	oh it make sense
S0505	mm it do really really yes
S0478	yeah i think airlines be pretty good at things like that
S0505	well they be last time but
S0478	they've obviously well they've obviously change a bite and
S0506	mm
S0505	they be they be they they be in a muddle about this extra class which have only be go since the begin of september i think they've bring it in
S0428	oh the economy
S0505	oh no the end of august i think we be almost the first few flight
S0428	the economy plus
S0505	yes it be worth it cos the seat be a decent size
S0428	yeah
S0505	but there be no no toilet in our our block of seat
S0506	huh
S0505	and we have to go through to economy and right well almost to the end
S0428	never end guess they haven't design them for that
S0505	no they hadn't design it properly yet
S0478	will they change the change it accord to erm how many erm people have book it
