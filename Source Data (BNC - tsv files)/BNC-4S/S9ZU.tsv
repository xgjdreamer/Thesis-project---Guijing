S0417	yeah yeah yeah
S0475	but he have that just that sense of play with word or ideas you know erm not quite just
S0417	he's go to be an interest fellow i think when he grow up

S0415	you'd be disappoint now if he turn out to be an accountant
S0417	yeah like a really he vivacious though isn't he well he could be a vivacious accountant you don't have to be bore to be an accountant do you it's a very good job
S0475	absolutely
S0475	and then you could when the day's over
S0417	yeah my grandfather be an accountant actually
S0475	i don't think when the day be over
S0417	no he didn't
S0475	it be erm i mean
S0417	what's it s dad be an accountant and he work for two weeks a year could be one like that
S0475	yes
S0417	i think you need to know people though i can't imagine he get there by just go to his local technology college and then just sign up at a local firm
S0417	and then like now live in a mansion i can't imagine that that be the case he's get to like have have some contact or something either that or he join the mafia i don't know
S0475	mm
S0417	just look at me as like be he quite a good accountant oh no he be just ordinary okay very nice
S0475	although erm erm we we have someone who do the company's book but he wasn't a charter accountant he be just an accountant
S0417	so he wasn't erm register he just call himself an accountant
S0475	book erm no no he be you've get to do four years to be an accountant and eight years to be a charter accountant
S0417	oh i see oh right i just what's cos she's
S0475	mm she's an accountant
S0417	oh i see
S0475	so she do four years
S0417	eight years
S0475	erm
S0417	that's ridiculous isn't it
S0475	i think i mean you work at the same time as when when i say eight years it's not eight years full time study it's sort of like at night or day release or something
S0417	mm yeah
S0475	erm but yeah erm and if you're a charter accountant you can do erm cos this fellow work with a charter accountants firm
S0417	yeah
S0475	and when you know the wee garage
S0417	yeah
S0475	i be once secretary and treasurer i don't even like cars it er
S0417	i know i think you definitely get fob off
S0475	absolutely get the short straw there
S0417	yeah you're too nice
S0475	and and the the the the government rule at that time about erm and when we have to pay four hundred quid it wasn't my fault the four hundred five hundred quid er but we still have to do the book by a charter accountant and that the firm that that belong to just do it for nothing just good will but erm erm grandfather have be with them in 's firm
S0417	yeah
S0475	so phew
S0475	and then they give it up we sell the garage
S0475	no we didn't we didn't sell it then but er
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm and then the government drop out that erm money
S0417	yeah
S0475	er for company that i mean we didn't we didn't do anything we get money from the people who own the garage so that we could repair the damage
S0417	yeah
S0475	we didn't make anything we didn't do anything
S0417	yeah
S0475	we didn't have huge profit no profit at all
S0417	yeah
S0475	erm it be such a silly rule
S0417	yeah they're bring in license for erm er rent properties in my area in i get a letter
S0475	license
S0417	yeah
S0475	right
S0417	i think they're probably try to crack down on rogue landlords
S0475	yeah mm
S0417	but yeah i'll have to pay for a licence and i'll have to fill in load of form and things
S0417	i know oh my god
S0475	mm
S0417	so
S0475	well it's it's er it's in it's swing a lot the other way now though
S0417	mm
S0475	i mean in let you've get to be really it's it must be a nightmare let anyway because you've get to get sufficient insurance you know just can't sort of say it's i think it's alright if you let a room in your house and you're live there
S0417	mm mm yeah
S0475	the rule aren't quite so strict
S0417	no
S0475	no but erm otherwise it's just erm i do have a a little not an argument but
S0475	erm with with erm
S0417	that's what he do
S0417	that's what that's his his argue be his current form of conversation
S0475	this be just it be a difference of opinion
S0475	he say that if you if you let your house
S0417	mm hm
S0475	you should be able to take off your rent that you have to pay in another house
S0417	er
S0475	erm so that would not be you would not be tax on the money
S0417	oh right oh
S0475	so if you let a house for a thousand pound and rent for five hundred then you would only be tax on the extra five hundred i say no i don't really think it work that way
S0417	i doesn't work like that
S0475	it's it's it's it come out of your income dear and i say erm and it would be too hard to sort of you know it would be too hard to distinguish the people who actual go somewhere else from work
S0417	well what be he do be he be he say they should do or be he say yeah
S0475	yes the the the government should take that
S0417	should take yes because
S0475	and only for people who have to move for work so not for
S0417	have to move for work i see
S0475	not for people who just do it for an income i well i don't know what he mean dear
S0417	i mean if you if you be in dire straits and you have to move and you put your house on the market then the government would give you i think a couple of months erm i think to allow you to sell the house if it hadn't get any for example if you be in dire straits but if you have a lot of equity in the house i mean do that anyway cos you say if you need to say claim
S0475	right
S0417	some bits or something but erm apart from that if you can afford to rent your house and rent somewhere else okay if you've get extra and you're earn it then they don't want to know
S0475	you've get all these people that have get move to london you know
S0417	all these people that've get to move to london i think there be people worse off
S0417	i mean i wouldn't be go round go
S0417	if you've get a house you can rent out at least you've get something
S0475	that's right he just he just couldn't see my point at all and i couldn't see his so we decide
S0417	because he have to pay tax on that they'll have to pay i wonder if they will they'll have to declare themselves as foreign landlords like me i wonder if they will
S0475	i don't know
S0417	erm and
S0475	yeah they but they to be erm er they don't he doesn't like pay tax right
S0475	i i haven't meet a lot of people who i didn't mind pay tax i just think well work and
S0417	yeah
S0475	that's the money i get so erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	people look at what i ought to get
S0417	yeah
S0475	and but i be never tax and now i'm
S0417	yeah yeah
S0475	but the erm but he will use anything that i mean he's be run his company for age i think people that run company erm put claim in you know legal claim you know erm
S0417	yeah but they'll only yeah i'd have they get much of a mortgage then leave
S0475	no mortgage at all
S0417	oh i see well yeah they'll be tax on everything just about everything
S0475	that's right
S0417	cos i've get they're not i think they're okay in the uk really cos erm i can claim back the interest that i pay not the repayment part
S0475	right right but
S0417	i can take that off and that make a huge difference that i'm repay the fact that i don't have to pay any tax now cos there's a limit erm i'm not really earn anywhere else erm so and ireland in the end erm kind of stop harass me and they cos they be go to ask for money but erm s accountant help and just couldn't say it's not erm er what's the word when you don't take the money into the other country what's the word for it
S0475	i don't know but erm you just erm
S0417	but anyway i don't i i put a tax return in every year
S0475	i i tell me not to put in a tax return
S0417	oh really
S0475	cos i use to cos my granny use to send in a tax return erm in the old days and she would just say don't understand
