S0251	ninety seven
S0368	yeah
S0251	so now we want to find don't we
S0368	yeah

S0251	so we want yeah that's what we can't find
S0368	her her name be her erm erm maiden name
S0251	yeah but yeah
S0251	but in nineteen eleven she'll've be marry won't she
S0368	mm yeah yeah so
S0251	so that's
S0368	mm
S0252	where i mean my suspicion's it's that one the second one down
S0251	there's only there's only
S0368	no it's that one here
S0252	erm so that be london
S0368	mm i want to get near it

S0251	it might've be use
S0252	want me to make it a bite brighter so
S0251	yeah make it a bite brighter
S0252	i imagine that it will be no it's
S0369	mm
S0368	we be in the same area aren't we i don't think i don't remember
S0251	i think it's the one that i don't know
S0368	that one
S0252	the second one
S0251	mm
S0368	but she be bear in then
S0252	no
S0251	no
S0252	that's where she currently be
S0251	it's where you be on the
S0368	oh yes of course it be yeah
S0252	yeah
S0368	yes right yeah erm mm
S0251	because it's about the poorest area of london probably
S0368	it could be well she wouldn't be the seventeen one would she
S0251	no she couldn't be old enough
S0368	she wouldn't be the
S0251	cos of the i don't think
S0368	that's it yeah yeah be that better
S0251	and what about the dad's then cos that be the same death one isn't it
S0252	that presumably that's er doesn't down to nineteen

S0368	oh right
S0252	erm military
S0251	no grandma
S0252	but

S0368	yeah
S0252	her middle name
S0368	yeah yeah find it
S0251	so i think he be in bear in i think
S0368	mm
S0251	do you think that's right
S0368	mm
S0251	and i think he be there at until he be at least ten years old
S0368	mm
S0251	cos he's in two

S0368	mm
S0251	in
S0368	yeah be bear in kent then move into kent to
S0368	they weren't fight it just show how many there be doesn't it
S0251	yeah there's more than i think

S0251	mm
S0369	the officers' mess be on that side of the road and the actual camp be on that side
S0251	yes
S0369	and walk to it
S0369	like it wasn't that far
S0369	in fact i think on the same road be the another town something like or something
S0369	and it be the tree
S0369	that er charles the second hide in
S0369	when he be he be er when he'd come back and i think that that's interest cos er you know you remember certain things don't you

S0369	that's his service number and
S0368	service yeah
S0369	mm
S0252	so
S0369	that's his regiment number
S0369	private

S0369	mm so what have you get this up on
S0252	this be the imperial war museum

S0369	mm
S0252	who fight in the first world war
S0369	and you can fill it in and send it off and then
S0252	erm i think it will just update as soon as you do it as far as i'm aware
S0369	mm
S0252	well they've get this information off the medal's card i imagine
S0369	mm
S0252	and they be sort of start to try and find other things like which battle they be in and that sort of thing
S0369	mm
S0252	i think quite a lot of information be lose in the second world war
S0369	yeah that's what i've be tell
S0252	yeah
S0369	a lot of record be destroy in london when they be
S0252	mm

S0369	mm
S0252	only about twenty percent remain
S0369	mm yeah that's what they say twenty percent remain
S0369	mm
S0252	well i hope you find that interest
S0369	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	yeah
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0369	yeah like when i go into that er that shop which be for this er
S0368	mm yes
S0369	so they've get it without and there's some quite some er interest artefacts and this that and the other and er that they have and
S0369	and message and a lot of it be all relate isn't there
S0368	mm picture and things
S0369	mm mm a lot of picture of them er which of course be er interest to us because we be there when i remember
S0369	i mean for example the er there be a bomb drop in avenue avenue
S0368	mm
S0369	near there and it be a trip to go see it
S0368	mm
S0369	there be load of people go to see it i mean
S0368	well the church be a methodist church at the top of avenue it be really big
S0251	mm
S0368	methodist church and previously when they'd be the next street's where live wasn't there
S0369	mm
S0368	we go there for
S0251	yes
S0368	and you know sort out and then just after that this church be absolutely flatten wasn't it
S0369	mm that be a landmine
S0368	yes
S0369	mm street and
S0368	yeah
S0369	that
S0368	and then
S0369	church
S0368	this next street but one erm the whole street be flatten wasn't it
S0369	mm
S0368	street
S0369	street
S0368	and erm and then the the next street avenue be erm
S0369	mm
S0368	on road be street and that be flatten
S0369	no that be a that be er well that be just one bomb
S0368	yes
S0369	and that that that be what i be try to think that one that be our street get bomb
S0369	and that be just yeah i remember avenue
S0368	mm mm
S0369	so that be a trip everybody have a trip up there to go and have a look at it
S0368	and then the next one be just across the road in street
S0369	yeah that be big that be another landmine
S0368	mm
S0369	but go back to that landmine er it be in the paper we have a flashback
S0369	page occasionally
S0369	and they be say about this landmine and there be an eyewitness account of who er of the house and he be look and i look up and there be this parachute come there
S0369	and i don't know what he do whether he run or get under cover or whatever but that be it and that go off and it be come over from er road there
S0369	so it be and er and no they be really big
S0369	now then when that street go it be all quiet
S0369	and well it be fairly quiet and anti aircraft gun go off or or bombers it be all finish there wasn't much but it be finish and you you always know the engines of the german plan and he buzz off and it's all quiet and we be in our air raid shelter there when there be this because it be absolutely quiet there be this almighty explosion and anyhow eventually the all clear go and so say come on let's go see where that that be who's get that well he be three years older than me so i'd be maybe eleven he'd be fourteen say and we think it be your end of avenue so we go up there no and although there be still a hush about the place there be a babble you know a er almost a level of noise people talk and
S0369	and we go up er street
S0369	yeah on road that's where the tram shed be
S0369	you know the tramlines go in there yeah that's where asda be now we go up there we say we'll just have a look up here cos we be aware that it be up there there be a a smell about the place and i go up there and we come to er we pass it this morning didn't we
S0368	mm
S0369	at street the other end of street
S0369	and it be flatten
S0369	and it be there be soot and dust and you could hardly breathe there be there people shout er er swear go on er dog bark
S0251	be there people trap or
S0369	mm mm yeah
S0369	plenty er there be where the gas pip have be a lot of them be on fire you know they be go
S0369	there be water pip burst there be water go all over and the rescue workers be come in from road you know they you could see em come over and get some light rig up and that type of thing and there be so we come back the the way we go
S0251	mm
S0369	we know that be clear we'd come back to where it be come back past the tram shed again that significant because next morning there be a one of these big landmines which be drop by a parachute it have hit the girder the parachute have get catch up with the with the er girders and it be like that
S0252	dangle
S0369	dangle between a couple of tram and we be we be
S0369	if that had've go off
S0251	that could've go off at any second couldn't it if it have slip
S0369	mm mm but when they when they take that down er they say we're take it down there be a a picture in the paper of this girder
S0369	which be bend like that where it hit it and i go and i take a photograph of it i don't know where that photograph be now but er i do take a a picture of that
S0251	at the time
S0369	no
S0251	a lot later
S0369	yeah cos it be when they're knock it down to build
S0251	oh right
S0369	asda and they say that's that's the girder
S0369	mm
S0251	i remember that night yeah
S0251	mm
S0369	mm that that be the night when
S0251	we be get over it actually
S0369	and so now
S0369	and you could smell the explosives and that it
S0369	it be awful now well you might say well why why drop them with parachute it be that big an explosion they have to be drop to make sure it hit the city
S0252	mm
S0369	and didn't stop into field or anywhere to hit the city fairly low
S0369	and it be such an explosion it it er it have to give time to er
S0251	oh for the aeroplane to get out of the way
S0369	for the aeroplane to get out the way cos it's go there this could've be
S0251	and that would set the plane on fire
S0369	catch up well it get catch up in it like
S0369	you know you know er they work it out like that it be massive now then there be another another be in the air raid shelter and er when the bomb drop you can sometimes hear them you know like whistle they come whistle down and you could sort of tell from the way after you've hear a few
S0369	whether or
S0369	far away but this one be different it be like really like an express train it go dead quiet
S0369	you come out and you know there be just a little slip of garden like that and i be fully expect it to be in there
S0251	yes it sound so close
S0369	mm that's what i think it be mm
S0368	where be that at the railway
S0369	that be at the railway
S0369	and it hadn't go off
S0369	but that be a really funny story there because no that's when the next morning we be evacuate
S0369	and that's when we go in this methodist church
S0369	at the top of avenue
S0369	and that's where i get the best rice pudding i've ever have
S0369	so much so and it be it be one of those er you know round
S0368	oval
S0369	like what they put in
S0369	and er and i go and ask for more
S0369	oliver i've be there i've see that one and er the and it be street
S0369	i don't know whether street be okay but that's where the cordon be
S0369	you couldn't go past there and then the er auntie come we do one night there and auntie'd come there auntie who live in street so we're go back round nearer er where the bomb be in a way but still this side of it and we stay there be there maybe a week you know maybe four or five nights there before they decide it be all clear
S0251	so who be that you and your grandma and grandad or everybody
S0369	all of us all of us
S0251	so how many would be in the house
S0369	exactly it be
S0368	about ten or something
S0369	it be
S0369	there be auntie and uncle
S0369	er and
S0251	her two children
S0369	yeah us include my dad cos he have his gear and all that out there
S0369	and me mam grandma and grandad
S0369	er myself er
S0369	our
S0369	and and i should imagine be there
S0251	so about twelve possibly
S0368	mm
S0369	and
S0369	we'd be five in a bed
S0369	we be all in bed and say when father say turn we'll all turn cos there be a lot of laugh and that go on and quieten down and it be head to tail you know there be two at the end and three up at the at this end like somebody say turn so we all turn and the bed the bed foot go through the floor
S0369	oh everybody out and they're all in their night shirt and what have you mm
S0251	that's another fine mess you've get us into
S0369	yeah mm
S0251	so that's another job to mend the floor now
S0369	yes
S0368	mm
S0369	but it get even funnier really because
S0251	i'm glad you find this amuse i bet grandma didn't find it amuse
S0369	or auntie yeah
S0251	no
S0369	er in the in the zone the the er zone that be evacuate be hotel the local pub
S0251	that's
S0369	and they have er a delivery of beer but it it be like ration er they only get so much and that and the beer come and it be allow through
S0369	yeah and be re supply yeah now just past there maybe a hundred yards be the railway gate where the soldier be er and they be all muddy you could see where they be work it be quite in good view they've get this er tripod of legs up and they go to have a pint in hotel i think they maybe stay a little too long when they come out the bomb have slip off this this rope and
S0251	girders
S0369	go back in again
S0369	yeah but they hadn't what they have to do when they get the detonators out they then i think they drill another hole in somewhere and they put a of steel in er you know er the
S0369	er
S0369	and take it away
S0369	they say it won't go off
S0369	you know unless something really daft happen
S0369	mm and so they leave it they leave it there and it didn't come out of there till after the war when they take it out but all the train that leave by there be come in or go out
S0369	slow down for it
S0251	just in case
S0369	mm yeah they have to slow down there
S0369	when they do get the this out it be clean up because the other side of the railway gate be brass work
S0369	that be er a a munition factory they be make bomb
S0369	you know the case and that
S0369	and part and er they have it clean up and it be in the er front office be or the you know the office as they call it er on show
S0369	and then it go into museum
S0369	where i have my photograph take against it
S0369	and er but now it's still on show at er with a like a theme park thing of different things that er they call it
S0369	and it's on show there it be er er like you know but er that's another good one that mm
S0369	i mean lucky escape i think it be i don't think it be that would've blow us to bits like the landmine do or would've be er but it certainly would've do damage to house and er
S0368	yes that be the thing after anywhere nearby it and it be cardboard or wood or paper anything that you could get your get hand on
S0368	certainly not straight away
S0369	mm
S0368	you have to wait to see if you could get some didn't you
S0369	yes
S0368	mm
S0368	yeah
S0369	well all you've get you've get when the action be go on er and the er that would go to shrapnel you know

S0368	yeah but one and eleven be less than like ten pence be nowadays for a load of paper
S0369	god
S0368	that and then that er what about the border
S0369	yes

S0368	so it didn't use to be call emulsion what be it call
S0369	distemper
S0368	distemper
S0369	mm
S0368	but er
S0369	now the they call it emulsion but you know this emulsion distemper be the forerunner of er er emulsion and this distemper be just like a
S0368	a colour chalk
S0369	a colour whitewash
S0368	yeah
S0369	mm
S0368	when you use to stand there you know
S0252	so
S0368	yes
S0252	yeah
S0368	so like in the past everybody have sort of floral erm paper
S0251	mm
S0368	but you you use to go and buy it you use to take your own didn't you
S0369	mm which be usually the er national
S0251	milk

S0368	there be only yellow wasn't there yes
S0251	magnolia

S0369	mm
S0368	it they didn't
S0369	er er
S0368	so when it's finish dad say i i don't like it when you'd finish your paint it be a big decision
S0252	huh
S0368	which kind of border you be go to have
S0252	what be that what go in the middle
S0368	no
S0369	around the top
S0368	top sometimes it use to be right to the top sometimes it use to be so many

S0368	so he go into the shed and then we find some black paint
S0369	that he be paint his bike with
S0368	yeah his bike paint
S0251	border yes
S0368	and just put some of this black paint
S0251	mm
S0368	for a border it look awful
S0251	really terrible

S0368	oh yes
S0369	be the net curtain
S0368	yes net curtain and you you erm and you have some and let that dry
S0369	a different colour
S0368	and then you er have this piece of net curtain
S0369	a different colour distemper
S0368	yes and so you dip it in and sort of
S0368	stab it
S0252	i bet that be a
S0368	another mess
S0368	and paint you could only get brown paint couldn't you
S0369	yeah no no there's
S0368	or green
S0369	no no no nice brown

S0369	yeah that be
S0369	that be last
S0252	the a bite about the erm the the way the
S0252	mm
S0369	and er just this little example
S0252	yeah
S0369	of the reliability of this technology
S0252	mm
S0252	yeah
S0369	that somebody could do that er mm er
S0252	uhu
S0369	and er we be just one big experiment
S0252	mm
S0369	and they decide to that it's we're not good enough that it's quite a think really
S0252	mm
S0369	er in as much as when you consider the evidence of how how much er you're will to accept to say that's true cos the thing be the i don't really agree with it but science er any theory be accept until it's prove false
S0252	yeah
S0369	so the if they say
S0369	the moon be make of er cheese you've get to believe it because you know it's gonna be until it's prove false prove false but on the other hand
S0252	mm
S0252	right okay
S0369	er and er er
S0369	now then the other i think the second rule of be an action
S0252	mm
S0369	will get a reaction and the reaction can be often greater than the initial action and this go on always er through life really about how things react
S0252	huh
S0369	even people react to different people in different ways either pleasantly or unpleasantly like er but when they when that er you get go on how how er how lucky or unique actually this earth

S0369	you know from iron and copper and coal and all that business and then all the vegetation which be give off the oxygen
S0369	through synthesis er
S0369	take in the carbon and and give off the oxygen there's life there the amount of water that's require
S0251	yeah yeah
