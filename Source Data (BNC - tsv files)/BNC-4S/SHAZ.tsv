S0337	the grind be er basically solid molehills you could stand on and just stamp on them as well
S0339	wow
S0338	nothing happen yeah
S0337	moles be clever though they're very
S0339	i watch i i stand there
S0338	watch one come up the other day
S0339	the other day on this
S0336	in the garden
S0339	in this path down there i be stand there er friday
S0337	do they pop their head out
S0339	i be wait for the head to come up no we just well soil keep appear
S0338	you should have get a camera
S0339	and there be nothing it be just and i suddenly saw the soil i dunno what make me look
S0338	do you know if you'd have a camera
S0339	and a mole just start
S0338	the countryfile calendar
S0339	now this piece of soil pop out this pop up
S0337	yeah
S0339	and i carry on watch it for about fifteen minutes
S0337	wow
S0339	and it gradually get bigger get about that high like that
S0337	yeah and he be do
S0339	no
S0339	molehill be now that high
S0338	you mole
S0339	you be a rascal
S0338	so happy make burrow
S0337	why do they make hole
S0339	well the soil get to go somewhere it's just
S0338	they make their tunnel
S0339	expand its tunnel
S0338	and they get air as well a vent to go at that point
S0339	ventilation and it's also to do put the soil they're dig i mean they're dig
S0338	the work
S0339	they've gotta put the soil somewhere
S0337	doesn't it start somewhere
S0339	well they must do
S0338	they start underground
S0337	because it really in my head a molehill would be where they start
S0338	the first mole think about it
S0337	because if he's always
S0338	and mr mole
S0339	there would be
S0338	meet mrs mole underground
S0339	yeah there would be
S0338	and they have baby
S0339	but molehills mole or mole colonies the run go for hundreds of metres the tunnel
S0337	there's normally a line of hill
S0339	yeah
S0337	well he didn't go oh i'll start here ble ble ble
S0339	yeah i don't
S0337	ble ble ble
S0339	yeah but it's it's a that's like
S0337	yeah
S0339	almost ask which come first the chicken or the egg the mole a mole must have start somewhere at some time
S0338	they have baby underground and then
S0339	they never come up usually
S0338	that's my baby the baby go that way bye bye baby go that way
S0337	it just doesn't make sense
S0338	they don't go over grind
S0339	they dig a new tunnel it's like dig a coalmine they start off dig and they end up with a heap but then after that or admittedly all their all their stuff be cart back to the original hole a mole go upwards every once in a while to push all the rubbish up
S0337	oh it's just make a hole in the in the grind just to put it up
S0339	yeah
S0338	yeah or just move down
S0337	do it look behind him and go oh there's a lot of rubbish there presumably he's like all all four limbs

S0337	builder
S0338	it be his build business and he's more build and be erm be a erm landscape gardener
S0337	really
S0338	originally i believe
S0337	so er
S0338	but then i think he's he's do a lot of paint and decorate
S0337	i know dad have have them in the office for for partition
S0338	partition well he's change the the sign on the side of the van to take out the partition and to put into build cos he say he's get so much work now north of erm so erm through extensions and things
S0337	yeah
S0338	and word of mouth
S0337	people
S0338	people
S0337	go through that stage of we're we can't find afford to move
S0338	i know
S0337	but what money we do have we'll we'll put into our house
S0338	well to invest in with what we've get yeah
S0336	that's the best way to do it
S0338	it be
S0336	it's exactly what you guy have do here like you improve the space you've get
S0338	yeah
S0336	rather than try to move
S0338	try to move
S0336	but it's all about find the right
S0337	the right place
S0336	place in the first place
S0337	to do it yeah we can't we can't improve ours at all there's nothing we can add to it as far as i can tell
S0336	no
S0338	no
S0336	we're already
S0337	we haven't get the space
S0336	talk about what we want next time though aren't we
S0337	yeah
S0338	wait till you've make some money on it first
S0337	yeah
S0336	well
S0338	it'll be twelve months after the the estate's finish
S0336	oh yeah we're we're probably not gonna move for the next five years or so
S0337	no
S0336	but it's quite interest to start have a little bite of a think about what we'll want
S0338	yeah
S0337	i'd probably say after five years look to remortgage with the whole lot in it
S0338	well if you
S0336	yeah
S0338	well we here
S0337	like so we'll probably end up with a eighty seventy percent mortgage
S0338	with with here
S0336	if we pay ten percent off in five years
S0338	when we come here when we have the four bedrooms and we decide we probably need the reception well we look to do something rather than we be look to extend there be no house better than this house for bedroom size
S0337	oh yeah
S0338	and we look at we didn't want to go north
S0336	yeah
S0338	because of dad's commute and er we look at er there be absolutely nothing cos of the plot
S0336	yeah
S0337	oh it's
S0338	the size of the plot now since you've move there have be a house for sale in the other side of road
S0337	yeah
S0338	that be four bedroomed it's so date inside it's the sort of house that would have the partition between the din room and the kitchen with internal glass windows
S0336	yeah
S0338	mottle but it could be stun big big plot big attach garage that's the sort of
S0337	how much
S0338	i can't remember it be a really good price it be er well less than two hundred thousand and that's the sort of thing that you can er do up
S0336	that's what we want
S0337	and
S0336	like not a huge not a huge like
S0338	south face
S0336	you're gonna have to rebuild stuff the house but
S0337	i need something from seventies eighties
S0336	yeah
S0337	that hasn't really
S0338	south
S0337	be
S0338	yeah just south face large back garden
S0336	yeah
S0338	and you'd think do you know if you could do the commute that's a good property
S0336	yeah
S0338	to go for you know you know i think it's four bedroom but i wouldn't have have an en suite
S0337	no
S0336	no but they're really easy to put in nowadays
S0338	absolutely yeah
S0336	yeah and and also i love have an en suite it's really practical but when there's actually only two of us in the house it's a huge waste like
S0338	yeah
S0336	we don't use the main bathroom and the main bathroom be nicer really obviously it hasn't get an a standalone shower it probably could if it be like
S0337	jiggle
S0336	jiggle around yeah cos like that the whole of that right hand side of the wall which be just not use but
S0338	i love your house i do
S0336	i love our house as well it's just frustrate cos there's
S0338	yeah
S0337	there's a few things that we want
S0336	there's stuff i wanna do i'd i'd i'd love to if we have the money i'd love to just get crack but it but that's life isn't it you have to take your time with these things
S0338	yeah
S0336	and actually like without be er without be mean but it be quite nice go round 's yesterday because we haven't be round since they've move in
S0338	mm
S0336	and actually they haven't do a lot have they
S0337	no
S0336	so it do it do make me feel like oh it's not as if like we're take our time with it like it do just take time and a lot of like their stuff need like a lot more work than ours as well
S0337	like what
S0336	well i know they've get like do you remember their second bedroom it's get like a weird big boiler room
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah erm they be on about convert that to an en suite or just like literally a shower room toilet sink et cetera er so that and then make their main bedroom that back bedroom
S0337	okay south face
S0336	cos apparently want an en suite i think they'd be push it cos their third bedroom's small as it be
S0338	it be a small bedroom that bedroom
S0336	the nursery
S0337	everything's really different be
S0338	they they think very differently don't they
S0337	yeah i'm gonna end up be like you and dad i'd rather not have a holiday and like
S0338	oh i think you need a holiday
S0337	no but you
S0338	well since he's retire we should have it's
S0337	you but you know you know what i mean i'd rather not not go on a extravagant ski holiday and then go to australia i would rather just focus on
S0338	i like the comfort i must say i do like the comfort
S0337	yeah
S0336	well it's one of those things like if we have a one holiday free year this year for example if we decide not to go away the amount we could do in the house
S0338	yeah
S0336	and then there's nothing stop us go on holiday next year and the year after that and the year after that
S0337	yeah
S0336	but that one this one year would just help us like get settle
S0337	so much
S0338	yeah
S0336	and then i'd be like happy cos
S0338	yeah
S0336	thing be there's like there's obviously structurally nothing that need do with the house
S0338	yeah
S0336	it's all it's all it's all like just superficial like
S0337	superficial yeah
S0336	like decorate
S0337	yeah
S0336	and it's just get it up to a place where you think like actually i'm really like quite proud of this like
S0338	yeah you should feel that now cos like
S0336	yeah i mean we do don't we
S0338	you really should
S0336	we be pretty chuff
S0338	yeah it's it's lovely
S0336	yeah
S0338	it be
S0336	i'm excite i can see what i wanna do in in the room and i just wanna get crack but it it take time also it's annoy like the skills and stuff that you need like i really wish i just know the right person to teach me like teach me once
S0337	yeah i know
S0336	like help me do it once and then i'll know how to do it
S0337	there's no practical people in our live
S0336	yeah
S0338	i know
S0336	but like it's even things like i dunno like tile and stuff like that
S0338	mm

S0338	yes
S0336	i just wanna be able to do job around the house
S0338	yeah
S0336	like tile especially in think how convenient would it be if you know how to tile
S0338	it's cut a bite and

S0336	if i be a little bite more confident with a
S0338	put a
S0336	the wood saw or something you could have a go at it cos the sand bite i think i'd enjoy and the paint and everything
S0338	yeah
S0336	so it would literally be just like
S0338	yeah
S0336	obviously you'd need a proper workbench and a proper wood cutter and stuff
S0338	yes
S0336	but like but
S0338	but you see you spend all your money on those things
S0336	yeah
S0338	what they do on the computer er and i have the but erm cos the people who do those for me the people who do our kitchen and he just program the area into the mdf the size into the machine
