S0689	oh i don't know where that be
S0690	big roundabout where the pub be
S0689	oh yeah yeah
S0687	and you go leave there to go towards then you turn right to get onto you can turn leave
S0688	and so you go on back to
S0689	oh yeah be that those flats be that
S0688	yeah well they look like they be apartments but on the estate there's erm
S0689	house
S0688	house yeah
S0689	i
S0690	be it a house they're buy or er
S0688	uhu
S0690	an apartment
S0688	a house
S0689	i think you mean you know on the little roundabout where there's like the railway the railway carriage
S0688	mm
S0689	i think it be on the right but that's isn't it not erm the toilet paper factory
S0688	oh
S0689	be that what it's call
S0688	what's it call be it
S0687	it use
S0690	it's not call any more be it
S0687	it use to be the
S0690	whatever it's call
S0688	mm
S0690	i bet you don't even remember tesco's use to be where be now they swap side
S0688	i can hardly remember that
S0690	just about
S0689	why do they swap side
S0688	dunno
S0687	i don't know why because that side's a big enough plot
S0690	well it's you know you drive on to and then tesco's be on your leave on on the right there's like an entranceway where lorries go in that use to be the car park and at the back where the warehouse be now use to be tesco's
S0689	right but why would they switch
S0690	suppose they want a bigger site or something i think it be big enough as it be i i can't remember
S0687	i be gonna say it's a huge site
S0688	don't know why they
S0690	it's a long time ago
S0688	i think 's bigger than tesco
S0687	yeah
S0688	maybe it be the other way round
S0690	dunno yeah must have be a good reason at the time must be fifteen twenty years ago i think
S0688	it's what it's be sixteen it's gotta be twenty
S0690	mm
S0687	or
S0690	i suppose
S0689	i i'm i'm
S0688	do you think one when have go
S0690	i
S0688	i think it's longer
S0690	i can't remember yeah you might be right i've get no idea
S0687	i don't remember it all i know be be that tesco's be huge
S0688	i don't think it's well use the space though they've extend it but
S0687	well they've extend it and then well they've spend a fortune extend it
S0688	and sublet it
S0687	and then they've not mm they've not increase the revenue enough to
S0688	like they think they would
S0687	yeah so now they're sublet the space that they spend a fortune extend
S0689	how much do they spend expand it
S0688	i think they'd have sell things like white goods there and stuff
S0687	sorry
S0688	mm no because they make it so much bigger
S0687	what's white goods
S0688	wash machine and stuff
S0687	oh
S0688	i know they do that online
S0687	yeah that would be a better use of the space because they literally do they didn't i don't think they get much new stuff they just kind of spread it out
S0688	mm i don't like it
S0687	you don't like it
S0688	no
S0687	i don't like it i didn't flip like it when someone come with a bottle of wine that's literally about half a mile away and want you to go and check the price and then you come back ten minutes later
S0688	can you not do it
S0687	oh you've be a while well do you know how far it be
S0688	can you not do it online
S0687	can you not do it what
S0688	could you not do it on the computer
S0687	sometimes if an offer's run out as soon as like it look like it say on the ticket offer valid twenty first to twenty third and if someone's not take it off on the twenty third it's still there on the twenty fourth someone pick it up think it's four pound it scan through the till because it's it automatically go up
S0688	oh
S0687	to the higher price so they've be overcharge because it's be advertise at that price and they've be charge a higher price
S0688	so you have to go and look at what it's be advertise as
S0687	so you have to go and visually like check that they're not just lie
S0690	mm
S0689	that'll be me soon
S0687	you won't it's on customer service desk that they have to do that
S0688	well if go at the same time they'll have the same shift that'll suit me cos need to save up and she doesn't need to work from september
S0690	be you gonna go back and do some hours then be you in the summer
S0687	hopefully
S0688	she offer you didn't she
S0687	uhu
S0690	what so just go back and
S0687	yeah
S0690	what the woman you didn't get on with or
S0687	no as i be leave one of the other managers say do you want a smaller contract the minimum contract they can offer you be seven hours so she offer me that there and then and i think about it and say no for now but when i've finish my exams i'll come back and she say okay
S0690	okay
S0687	but it'll all depend what the demand be like the week before that they say they be overstaffed on till and then the week after they be understaffed cos three people have leave that week or do you know what i mean it change all the time
S0690	so be you gonna talk to her when you get back
S0687	yeah
S0688	and take
S0689	i don't wanna sign anything there and then i'll wanna you know if she offer me something i don't wanna be like yes on er
S0687	well you'd have to say yes or no
S0690	yeah
S0687	you can't say let me think about it really
S0688	what you think about for
S0689	i just think i'm gonna be very busy and not be able to enjoy my summer that's what i'm think
S0688	you're only do seven hours a week
S0687	i wasn't think of get you like a thirty hour contract
S0688	think of the money
S0690	on top of your eighteen pound an hour
S0689	and the money i'm owe
S0688	and the money i owe you yeah
S0690	oh right yeah
S0689	i'm just be truthful
S0687	if you be be smart you'd work as much as you can over the summer and then you don't have to work whilst you're at college
S0690	that's probably a good idea isn't it that's a good shout
S0687	that's my plan i'm home for the rest of the summer so i may as well get in as many shift as i can if they need anyone now
S0688	they might have take on for the summer haven't they

S0687	what
S0689	i wouldn't mind a handbag dog i know it sound really unmanly i quite like handbag dog
S0687	it do sound really unmanly i'd quite like a golden retriever i think they're really nice
S0689	either that or like a
S0688	instead of a sussex spaniel
S0687	mm don't know
S0689	i think so
S0690	you wouldn't like you wouldn't like the erm
S0687	i don't know some of
S0690	hairs
S0687	the sussex spaniels look really oafy
S0689	yeah i agree

S0689	grim
S0687	i dunno
S0689	i'd i've i for me i think we should have if we be gonna if for me i think that our next dog should be a a guide dog
