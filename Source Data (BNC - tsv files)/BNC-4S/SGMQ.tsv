S0683	you get people who use a microwave rice in a bag
S0686	what that uncle ben's stuff
S0683	wikihow yeah
S0686	but it's
S0683	like microwave what be it egg fry rice
S0684	you're go to have so much fun with aren't you
S0683	it look and smell gross
S0685	egg fry rice in the microwave
S0684	you're not you're not
S0686	you can buy bag of rice they're like a pound each though for like a
S0684	you're not share your cook then
S0683	we be cos we're go to make sure he eat right
S0685	why do he not eat properly
S0684	so what happen on the day when he have to cook
S0683	we teach him to cook
S0684	be he teachable
S0683	that remain to be see
S0684	mm
S0683	he's quite stubborn
S0686	you have to i think you have to enjoy food to to want to cook though
S0683	yeah i don't think he well he do enjoy food but
S0686	but like you have to be discern otherwise you think oh you know why don't i eat stuff that come out the oven every day
S0683	he have either ridiculously hot like high salt diet
S0685	do he
S0683	so much salt
S0684	more than
S0683	yeah
S0686	i don't eat that much salt i just season my food
S0683	yeah you think 's bad be twice as bad
S0686	i don't i just season my food
S0684	focaccia have usually get sea salt on top of it doesn't it
S0683	when he's in subway he always ask for salt and pepper on the sub and stuff
S0684	it's usually quite salty
S0686	mm
S0684	erm
S0686	i don't salt my sandwich
S0683	erm and he go he go to like wetherspoons and he get like a mix grill and he's just pour it on so it get to the point when you don't think i don't reckon he's get the taste this pretty much any more
S0684	it's quite high gluten though isn't it mm it's very stretchy like ciabatta
S0685	mm
S0683	i mean it doesn't taste better i think he just like the taste of salt
S0684	but if you all cook with less salt he'll have to get use to it
S0683	exactly so we're go to do
S0684	and he'll stop the craze
S0683	we're go to see if we can do no er no like add salt or like add salt as season but no add salt at the table or anything
S0684	yeah if you buy proper salt like sea salt
S0686	you have to use less and it taste better
S0684	yeah you use that
S0686	but you still get it's still the taste the the taste be more intense
S0683	mm but i guess with salt if you add to much though you just taste the salt don't you
S0684	some foods have salty
S0686	it depend on your palette i think i don't know you don't salt meat it can be very bland
S0683	yeah
S0684	you shouldn't salt beef
S0686	what do you mean you should salt beef
S0684	before you cook it because all the water all the juices leech out of it
S0683	you salt and pepper don't you oh i
S0686	apparently yeah like joint of beef and stuff like that
S0684	any beef i've be tell
S0686	yeah but you salt yeah but any dish you salt
S0683	like er shoulder shoulder if you like salt a shoulder before you put it in the oven
S0684	that's different but if you're say fry piece of beef or or stir fry beef or something you shouldn't salt it
S0683	i wouldn't salt a steak before fry it cos it make it dry it out doesn't it
S0684	yeah because it draw out all the water
S0686	i don't salt my steaks no
