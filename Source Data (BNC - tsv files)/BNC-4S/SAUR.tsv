S0227	because i've never be to thailand i don't know what the thai curry be like but they're obviously use these ingredients
S0192	mm
S0227	but it's probably different
S0192	it vary a lot in thailand this be really good
S0227	it probably won't taste better than the best you've have but it'll probably take better than the worst you have
S0192	oh definitely
S0189	i've have some pretty bad curry in thailand
S0192	this taste good to me taste's great
S0189	you know erm

S0190	no not at all
S0192	no
S0189	you know in korea they kinda add this hot stuff to all their foods and it kinda leave like er at the top of the water there's kinda like a a red
S0192	oily residue

S0227	mm
S0189	oh right
S0192	sesame oil chilli chilli flake
S0189	they like put that in thai curry
S0192	yeah
S0189	in some place sometimes they put in so much it be unbearable though
S0227	mm apart from a tiny bite of cumin there's no other curry spice in here it's it's chilli
S0192	mm
S0227	as it's a bite it's not
S0192	it's not sriracha be it do you know sriracha
S0189	no
S0192	the sauce it's like a thai sauce american's really like it it's like a red spicy sauce
S0189	may've be that
S0192	could be sriracha
S0189	it's quite hot
S0192	i don't think it's the same in thailand than it be in korea
S0227	so i've depart from erm use thai cuisine erm it's get no erm cumin er sorry no it's get no erm erm cardamom in it no turmeric no cloves or anything like that
S0192	the thai ones no yeah they have a lot less than the indian ones don't they
S0227	it's get garlic and ginger the same and it's get coriander and a tiny little bite of cumin but that's it
S0192	well it's good i like it you like your asian food don't you
S0189	mm
S0192	though your belly maybe not so much
S0189	no my belly's alright with it
S0192	yeah
S0189	er struggle more with burgers and things like that
S0192	yeah
S0227	mm process
S0192	that burger for me be a bite
S0227	process foods
S0189	my stomach be alright when i be mostly travel it be just erm that food poison we get
S0192	that yeah
S0189	i get really regular like every time i'd wake up within like ten minutes i'd be er
S0192	yeah you can't keep it in
S0189	yeah
S0192	too spicy
S0189	no it's wasn't like that but it be it be good
S0227	mm
S0189	healthy
S0192	less solid than normal
S0189	no it be reasonable
S0192	talk about your motion at the dinner table
S0189	yeah nice subject
S0227	do you have lemongrass when you have to pick out or be it all kind of
S0192	you don't pick it out in general they they've already strain it
S0227	see the lemongrass that you cut up fine you'll be able to cook it and eat it
S0192	mm
S0227	if it's not cook enough or cut down enough it can be a bite chaffy
S0189	tough
S0192	woody
S0227	find it a bite chaffy but that's what happen
S0227	so i tend to most time although it's a bite cos i've gotta try and pull it out of them er before they've finish coriander and get all the lemongrass out
S0192	stick
S0227	the stick be easy but if you're put the leave in the leave even if i tie em in a knot to start with they untie
S0192	yeah and fall apart
S0227	and yeah
S0192	i steep mine
S0227	yeah
S0192	in hot water and then just add the water
S0227	yeah mm
S0192	i'm convince it's the main ingredient in lemsip
S0227	mm
S0192	cos it smell exactly the same as a lemon lemsip
S0227	it be
S0192	lemon lemsip doesn't smell like lemon it smell like lemongrass
S0189	mm yeah i suppose so do you put quite a lot of fish sauce in there
S0227	erm two tablespoonfuls
S0192	yeah
S0189	yeah it's nice
S0227	mm
S0192	always add that extra zing doesn't it fish sauce
S0227	mm
S0192	you don't really wanna just eat it on its own
S0227	no
S0192	do you reckon how many tablespoons of fish sauce could you handle
S0227	i don't know but i put two good size tablespoonfuls in
S0192	show us this hilarious video i think have see it already have you ever hear of the cinnamon challenge
S0227	the cinnamon
S0192	yeah you have to eat a tablespoon of cinnamon
S0227	oh right do you want some more
S0189	yeah please it's good
S0227	do you want some more
S0192	a little bite
S0192	thank you
S0227	do you want some more sauce
S0192	no that's ample do you want a bite more i think i get more than you probably give you another couple of bits of meat yeah the cinnamon challenge just look terrible
S0227	be that enough sauce
S0227	do you want some more sauce
S0192	no no i'm good dad thank you
S0227	that's it it's all do
S0192	if i eat too big a portion pretty much guarantee heartburn
S0227	be that too hot
S0227	no
S0192	you can eat a massive
S0227	what's it call a cinnamon what
S0192	cinnamon challenge
S0192	people eat a tablespoon of cinnamon it look awful er it look awful
S0227	mm
S0192	like the worst thing ever
S0227	cinnamon's quite sweet isn't it
S0192	yeah it's just the way that it completely coat your mouth and like
S0227	oh right
S0192	there's powder everywhere they can't breathe you just see them cough it out and like it look horrible
S0192	it look absolutely horrible for about three or four minutes they're just cough and splutter and scream and it look it look horrible
S0227	doesn't seem to be any pleasure in it
S0192	it look like they've just put sawdust in their mouth
S0227	mm
S0192	can you imagine like dry your mouth out
S0227	mm
S0192	and not be able to breathe and not be able to get it out of your mouth
S0227	right
S0192	it look like they just do that with sawdust
S0227	why do they do that
S0192	it's just become a craze on youtube
S0227	oh right
S0192	because people don't believe that it's as bad as that
S0227	mm
S0192	so they film themselves do it but it look terrible
S0227	i would also imagine that possibly someone who's asthmatic badly asthmatic it could probably finish em
S0192	no yeah it look like you could die from it i think
S0189	yeah
S0192	could send yourself into a cough fit and just not come back out
S0189	mm that wouldn't be good it doesn't look much fun to be honest
S0192	no that girl look really upset after she do it she be like oh my god the funniest be that big black woman that do it
S0189	yeah
S0227	it's surprise what people will do when when you put a camera in front of them
S0192	for a bite of fame
S0227	mm
S0227	the thing with this it's not erm erm sort of get it so that it's it's a hot curry spice that you can pick up everything in it like the lemongrass and
S0192	yeah
S0227	if i be to dump a load of chilli in in here you wouldn't be able to tell erm what else be in it
S0192	mm
S0189	this be my kind of curry it's really tasty
S0227	mm
S0189	i like it
S0192	be that brown sauce
S0190	i think it's just yep
S0192	last bite
S0227	do we get any more we say we be go to
S0190	we
S0227	well actually you cos you say oh oh i've get enough when we be at erm asda last week
S0190	yes erm you say we go shop yes
S0192	what be brown sauce make of
S0189	be it like ketchup
S0227	molasses be it molasses
S0192	do it say on the back it's interest that they put no nut and then the next phrase be cannot guarantee nut free
S0227	mm
S0192	straight after it say no nut why bother tell us that there's no nut
S0227	mm
S0190	cos it's make in a laboratory where they use nut
S0192	yeah
S0190	and it's for people that be hypersensitive
S0192	just skip the no nut bite and just say
S0227	anaphylaxis
S0192	cannot guarantee that there's no nut
S0227	some people nut can be fatal
S0192	oh yeah i know
S0227	mm
S0192	it's get apple pulp in it
S0227	be there any molasses or not
S0192	soy sauce no oh yeah yeah it's pretty high in molasses
S0227	i think it would be
S0192	water's the biggest ingredient then tomato purée follow by glucose fructose syrup follow by molasses and modify maize starch so there's three different type of sugar in a row and acetic acid date paste date in it
S0227	mm
S0192	interest
S0189	be you not eat the mushroom
S0227	no i be advise him not to didn't taste very nice
S0189	no
S0192	sorry you should've just put em in the curry
S0227	well no because
S0192	i could've pick em out
S0227	i know but i wouldn't like to put er eat something i didn't like that be infuse in my meal would you
S0189	mm
S0192	no i mean i just
S0192	i pick it out at the begin and give it to you and then i'll dig in
S0227	i attempt to be a little clever i should've just fry them off and then you could've just add the meat to your curry you know
S0192	mm
S0227	but i didn't which be my bad
S0192	you try to make a sauce out of it
S0227	which be my bad it didn't work the
S0227	tomato purée be wrong
S0227	i shouldn't've put the tomato purée in
S0192	no harm in try something new
S0227	another thing with with this one rather than indian ones indian ones i try to my indian curry be much drier
S0192	yeah definitely
S0227	with er with thais you gotta have the sauce er you can't have a dry well you can obviously there's i'm sure there's dry thai curry but
S0192	it be unusual they're usually like soup
S0189	yeah
S0227	mm
S0192	soupier even than this
S0227	mm
S0192	to the point where it's a soup
S0189	yeah i get disappoint a few time where i think i'd order a curry and i actually get a soup
S0192	yeah
S0227	yeah
S0192	everyone ready to play battlestar
S0227	indeed be you ready my dear
S0192	what do you think
S0190	we'll see
S0189	i'm ready
S0190	we'll see you have an advantage on me
S0189	i think we're all pretty fresh apart from
S0227	mm
S0192	there shouldn't be an advantage in the game play maybe very very very slight
S0227	mm
S0192	it might just be quicker to pick up
S0192	we're actually all work as a team
S0227	yeah
S0192	so we're not really work against each other we're work to help each other
S0227	oh right
S0192	so it shouldn't matter that you're disadvantage unless you're the cylon
S0227	well one of the four of us be go to be isn't it
S0192	perhaps even two
S0189	we could all four be cylons it could happen
S0192	the game end immediately
S0227	i think you've be present when you've see some of the episodes so you probably know the the main thrust of it that it's a a
S0189	there's a ship
S0190	yeah
S0189	and they're try to destroy it
S0192	simple simple
S0227	mm although there be quite a few ship
S0192	basically the the terminator be chase have destroy most of humanity's home and it's chase them across the galaxy try to kill them basically
S0190	so what's the idea of the game
S0227	survival i'd imagine
S0192	yeah the idea of the game be to reach a certain distance in the ship you've get to get to earth
S0227	we haven't finish erm er i dunno where we be in er series three or series four i can't remember
S0192	yeah and have we finish battlestar
S0227	no
S0192	that's terrible
S0227	well other things come along that we er start to watch
S0192	nothing should come between you and battlestar
S0227	the the walk dead be one of them
S0189	might have to watch
S0192	oh certainly not for the walk dead it's a lot lot better than the walk dead
S0227	mm
S0189	i'm with you on that one that one's terrible
S0227	's not a great fan of it
S0192	no
S0227	i don't mind it to be fair
S0192	the act be poor the storyline's poor all the character be extremely annoy i don't know if they do that just so i hope they die
S0227	mm
S0192	cos that work quite well kind of root for one of them to die
S0189	zombies
S0227	the zombies in world war z be far more animate than they be in the walk dead
S0192	mm
S0227	cos
S0192	do you like the movie
S0227	it be watchable it be a film it wasn't
S0192	wasn't great
S0227	it wasn't it wasn't bad it it wasn't great it wasn't bad
S0192	do you ever read the book

S0189	be the book
S0227	so i would've read it
S0192	it's only it's probably quite good for you cos it's just like short snippets of stories there's only like five to ten page per story
S0227	yeah yeah mm
S0192	so you could just read five to ten page
S0227	yeah
S0192	and you say that you're have trouble sleep i keep say try do you read
S0227	no
S0192	before you go to bed like in bed read
S0227	no erm

S0192	it's kinda like a skill you kind of have to get better at it when
S0227	mm
S0192	if you don't read very often
S0190	the more you read the faster you read
S0227	mm
S0190	and the more you get into them
S0227	well if it's er if it's something that's grip i'll i'll tend to read more page but erm
S0192	yeah thing be things have to get grip
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's kinda like when you say would you start watch something you don't say it's naff immediately
S0227	no no
S0192	with a book it's the same you've get to give it a hundred page and then
S0227	i know i know
S0192	and then it get go

S0227	yes all confiscate and pass over to the normans the normans be french so for the next three hundred years the nobility of this country speak french they don't speak english
S0192	mm
S0227	the english be english be for the peasants but three three hundred years later the erm english nobility start to break away from the french well the it's it's they're fight over erm a claim to the french crown because the first plantagenet king be henry the second his wife be margaret of anjou who be the sister of the king so there be a children then there be a connection to so they be vie for the french throne like henry the fifth be also king of france as well as king of england
S0192	mm
S0227	erm and so there be the hundred years' war and erm yeah it's pretty interest and like i say the last one erm i think richard be the one you you must've read a little bite about him at school that you would know well we all you i think we take you as youngsters erm you probably wouldn't remember that but he be the king who allegedly put the two nephews in the tower
S0192	mm
S0227	and they be erm erm cos his brother be king
S0192	mm
S0227	and have die but i think that erm he be er i don't know if he do it i think his wife probably do it erm rather than him but i could see his dilemma be that erm his older brother who'd become king didn't look anything like richard richard's get erm be quite short and and slender and have scoliosis which be a curvature of the spine a bad one erm his brother be a six footer plus big strong jaw erm the er the bite where obviously they kind of think mm be that their father the king be in france for thirteen months so er sorry eleven months so the gestation she get pregnant and have a child but he wasn't in the country for eleven months he take er and consider it his his own but there seem to be a remarkable difference between the celebration that be have for their first bear and the big celebration they have for the second bear which be richard normally you'd push the boat out for your first sorry but have to do that
S0192	i don't know how you remember all these kings and queen and all them
S0190	because we watch them
S0190	one after the other
S0227	and so although he know that his he they the talk be that the father be an english archer erm and have obviously have an affair with the the queen whilst the king be in france
S0192	mm
S0227	erm hence the stature er er cos most of the archers be tall tall guy erm so when he accept that his brother older brother be go to be king but when he die he think to himself well i'm the i'm the actual genuine heir my brother's two children the mother be be the queen but the but the grandfather be an archer
S0192	mm
S0227	so either he or the royal machine get them out of the way and they be murder they be only about nine and eleven
S0192	history
S0227	but but what happen at the end of the plantagenets be the which be the house of york against the house of lancaster the the white be york the red be lancaster
S0192	lancaster lannister
S0227	they fuse them they they fuse it as in the tudor rise
S0192	mm
S0227	it the then the tudor propaganda erm have to erm change everything to make it look like erm cos henry the seventh win on the battle of erm bosworth which be where he defeat william his connection to the to the throne be that his mother have marry the erm bastard brother of the king that's that be the strongest connection so they
S0192	mm
S0227	he she he have to marry er someone with a stronger connection to force you know to make it more of a bond
S0227	so the tudor's do a propaganda on richard the third and vilify erm turn him into er a he have a deformity but they turn him into a hunchback
S0189	yeah
S0227	in in shakespeare's play and stuff like that really
S0189	yeah
S0192	do this interest you as much as dad
S0227	no
S0190	i use to but not i get a bite feed up
S0227	there's certain part of history that
S0227	that i'm interest in there's other part of history that i'm not
S0192	not so interest in no you seem to like the er monarchs british monarchs
S0227	i like the monarchs i also like erm people like er temüjin who become genghis khan
S0192	mm
S0190	yeah
S0192	conquerors and monarchs
S0227	i like i like cromwell and he be a king killer
S0192	revolutionaries conquerors and
S0227	yeah so er all of the all of the

S0227	well
S0192	if i go to the toilet and just leave this
S0189	yeah sure
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah cool
S0227	i be just say erm leave
S0192	i'll go to the toilet
S0227	okay
S0192	it's still go
S0227	alright
S0189	have you have a look at this game it's monumental it's crazy
S0227	be it gonna be a tough tune to er pick up
S0189	maybe but i think know it quite well so
S0227	right so he can give us the idiot's erm guide to it
S0189	mm
S0227	right
S0189	there's probably gonna be too much to pick up in one go so as we play we might need him to explain
S0227	yeah that complex hey
S0189	mm cos the board be
S0227	tough tune
S0189	there's a lot go on
S0192	right be there anything else you don't understand on this
S0189	erm i don't understand anything that's on that table there
S0192	nothing
S0189	no i understand some
S0189	we'll see like i don't know how we start and what's the first thing we do and everything like that
S0192	cool first thing we've gotta do be choose a character
S0189	well i guess that but after that
S0192	erm
S0189	yeah and then we get the card and we find out whether we're a cylon or not
S0192	yeah
S0189	and then after that
S0192	after that we collect our erm skills card
S0189	how do you know what ones you get
S0192	it say it on your card here he's gonna have two yellow two green and one purple
S0189	okay
S0192	so you collect that every round
S0189	do we use them all at once
S0192	no you bet with them so on the card it will have two things it will have a number in the corner and one to five five would be a strong bet card one would be a low but it also have an action so you can either use this card to bet with or you can do the action on the card some of the action allow you to give other people action the action be quite different the card repeat a lot though
S0189	er so the
S0192	so like this one
S0189	so this card be er be one
S0192	yeah its bet power be only one
S0189	so that's low
S0192	yeah it's out of five
S0189	so who do you bet with the other players
S0192	yeah you work as a team to reach your goal of jump to kobol
S0189	so what would be the purpose of bet this against someone i don't understand
S0192	so there's gonna be a card here and the card be gonna have a crisis like this
S0189	yeah
S0192	and the crisis say if you pass then such and such if you fail such and such and then it's get a number thirteen
S0189	so
S0192	so collectively we need to get the power of thirteen and it's only with these two colour yellow and green
S0189	yeah so we can either i can either give this up or i can use its action
S0192	yeah
S0189	yeah
S0192	basically
S0189	that's cool
S0192	yeah
S0189	make sense
S0192	er so it have two function
S0189	yeah oh shit
S0192	that's the yellow one fairly complicate
S0189	yeah i know
S0192	hopefully won't cause any arguments
S0189	well we're play together so er
S0192	yeah somebody's not gonna be
S0189	yeah
S0192	somebody's gonna be either on their own oh that's what i be tell you earlier so when you get halfway to eight when you get to four we get dish out another card another loyalty card to see who's a cylon now if none of these wheel be in the red so if they're all the blue then there'll be a second cylon but if er any one of these wheel be in the red by the time we get to four then that there won't be another cylon they'll become a sympathiser and they'll get send to the brig but they're not a cylon they're a cylon effectively but they sympathise with the humans
S0189	be that your rule or the game's rule
S0192	it's the game's rule
S0189	right
S0192	the only rule i've add be every time we jump a basestar go at the front because sometimes you jump and the board clear and you can pull like five or six card and no cylons come on the thing and it can get a bite slow so every time we jump i put a basestar so that mean there's always a threat there's always a
S0189	this be how you play with your friends
S0192	yeah
S0189	yeah
S0192	there's always a threat it seem better that way we've only play that way like twice but it er seem better so i suggest we do it
S0189	how long er do these game take with your mat
S0192	three to four hours usually
S0189	you never say three to four
S0189	you say three
S0192	yeah well i don't think we're gonna finish it especially not at this rate don't really know what they're do be this still go yeah look like it ah
S0189	mm
S0192	do you know which character you're gonna be
S0189	no cos if i'm not first pick there's no point in make the choice
S0192	well you can be first pick
S0189	can do
S0192	choose a character do you wanna be a military leader a pilot which way be you lean
S0189	i think gaius would be an unwise choice for my first time
S0192	i be gaius on my first time
S0189	you probably wanna be gaius
S0192	i like gaius
S0189	yeah he's cool
S0192	i be tempt to grow my hair like that just kinda get it down to here
S0189	that's crazy
S0192	why be it crazy
S0189	er it's just a lot of hair
S0192	i've have my hair quite a bite longer than that
S0189	yeah
S0192	you know that
S0227	sorry
S0192	cool these be damage tokens you know that this be a bite pointless this one it's just a token that you have when it's your turn
S0189	yeah
S0192	don't really see the point in that it's pretty easy to remember whose turn it be
S0189	be it
S0192	so i'll just leave that there erm the on one of the expansions you get another board and the cylons all build up on the board and then they jump at once so you get like load of cylons attack you who be you go for
S0189	dunno should probably read through their actual abilities too
S0189	rather than just look at picture
S0192	that might take a while
S0189	what do you think a good choice be
S0192	i don't know maybe like i think as a pilot apollo's good he can jump into a ship whenever anyone launch a ship he can he can man it at any point i think he's better than boomer definitely erm the admiral's pretty good roslin's really good laura roslin she get to look at two crisis card every time who's that you get in your hand
S0189	i'm look at apollo at the moment
S0192	who's the other guy
S0189	tom zarek
S0192	what's his negative
S0189	he's a criminal
S0192	i don't remember him be great who else be good the chief's pretty good he's a bite of an all rounder helo's really good he's pretty good but the first round he doesn't go on the board that's his weakness but he's also a pilot as well as a commander
S0189	just say military leader
S0192	yeah but he can play pilot skill card can you see he can he can pick up red card do you need a hand out there guy
S0189	i might pick apollo then
S0192	you're gonna go for apollo
S0192	go for it
S0189	that'll be my pick then
S0192	yeah right 's apollo so you need a little apollo piece er here you be
S0189	sweet
S0192	what be that you have new unwanted message oh god can't do the week it's really hard to arrange with these people
S0192	erm i don't wanna go and see them separately i don't wanna have to go all the way out to and then and i'm have to organise it with the two of them
S0189	mm
S0192	can't they just they're sisters for cry out loud talk to each other and i keep try to ring them but like they're busy in the day 's at work so she doesn't answer her phone and i'm busy in the even so just a pain
S0227	right
S0192	you nearly ready
S0227	the comfortable chair and we'll have the uncomfortable ones
S0192	yeah i'll sit on the floor be you ready
S0190	yeah won't be a sec
S0192	excellent
S0190	mm
S0227	gonna wear my glass i think
S0192	okay time to play this may take a little while
S0227	ah right yes
S0192	hopefully it won't be too bad so we don't have to finish the game
S0227	no okay oh it's your toe yeah
S0192	
S0227	yeah
S0192	so first thing's first we need to choose a character
S0189	i've already choose mine
S0227	er who be you oh your em apollo
S0192	apollo yeah
S0227	who's leave adama
S0192	so there be pilot
S0227	yeah
S0192	there's one guy on his own he's a support the chief
S0227	the chief right
S0192	there's three military leaders and there's three political leaders now 's already choose a pilot so we have to be fair so you can't also choose a pilot
S0227	no
S0192	so you need to choose one of the most you can either choose support
S0227	i'll go for be er adama
S0192	okay right dad's adama take that one
S0227	right that's me
S0192	right you can either choose this guy or one from the political leaders here i recommend that you choose laura roslin she's pretty strong she's a good character
S0190	okay
S0192	yeah
S0190	yeah
S0192	so kind of choose for you but
S0227	right
S0192	no don't worry i'll be chief then i'll go for support
S0192	so we've choose our character
S0227	right
S0192	have you get two have you
S0227	no they're the the two that that erm yeah
S0192	that you didn't want cool right so if you look on your card
S0227	you've take my card back
S0192	why why do you give it back to me
S0227	i dunno i there you go right
S0192	if you look at your card everyone should have kinda like a positive thing that you can do every turn then underneath it there's something you can do once in the whole game and then at the bottom be like a negative thing
S0227	erm
S0192	do you see
S0189	do you see
S0190	typical
S0192	what oh yeah
S0190	just typical
S0192	sorry i didn't think about that at all
S0190	alright look at my negative
S0192	she's very sick isn't she
S0189	oh
S0192	sorry
S0192	she have a very good positive though she can look at two card at once
S0192	sorry
S0192	do you wanna change character
S0190	i'll just doesn't matter whether i
S0192	typecast
S0189	that's terrible
S0192	i'm really sorry she's a strong character
S0227	i'm emotionally attach
S0189	oh dear
S0192	okay so the idea of the game be we're all work together potentially
S0227	okay
S0192	to jump to kobol we wanna find kobol
S0227	oh yeah that's suppose to be earth isn't it
S0192	yeah so this be our jump track we need to get up to here and jump to the power of eight every time we jump we draw a card and it will tell us a number we wanna get these number to eight so they add together this be only two
S0227	right
S0189	this one have two so that'd be four total so we've jump twice but we're at a power of four we jump three time we're at a power of six just so happen they're all two
S0227	so what happen when you hit eight
S0189	we win the game
S0227	oh right
S0192	so we've gotta jump to er to to kobol and then we jump one more time and then we win
S0227	right
S0192	so it's a little bite complicate so i'll just explain it as we go along okay
S0189	sound good
S0227	yeah
S0192	so whose character's whose
S0227	who be i again
S0190	i'm laura
S0192	you're laura roslin okay laura roslin here you go

S0190	this be the president card
S0227	oh right
S0192	it should say that you
S0227	i
S0192	start with some quorum card or something do it say
S0227	that's er i'm
S0190	draw a quorum card into your hand
S0192	er right at the begin
S0190	at the start of the game draw one quorum card
S0192	okay that's your quorum card so you as the president you get special ability that you can always draw from these card er
S0190	er er can i look at it
S0192	yeah you're the only person that can use these card okay
S0190	okay
S0192	unless we take the president title from her which we can do cos she might be a cylon
S0227	yes
S0192	so we don't want a cylon as the president or as the admiral
S0227	not
S0192	so you have to be careful dad you're the admiral so you get the admiral's card and you also get two nuke tokens
S0227	oh right that's always come in

S0227	they always come in handy don't they
S0192	yeah

S0192	cos this be part of the game so
S0227	yes i'm go to put this down here
S0192	okay now have a look at where you place it should say setup on the bottom of your wrong
S0227	hold on let me just read this
S0192	yeah wrong card where's your setup
S0190	er president's office
S0192	president's office so you take the token and put it up in the president's office here okay
S0190	okay
S0192	so you're on a different ship we're on the main ship here where be you
S0189	it it say launch and pilot a viper
S0192	okay so you need that one not that one and you pilot a viper do you wanna launch on this side or on this side
S0189	erm that side's fine
S0192	this side's good so 's in a viper at the begin he can fly around the board
S0227	okay
S0192	we have to move on the board
S0189	how far can i move in go be it one of these
S0192	yeah sometimes two depend on your move
S0189	yeah
S0192	er i'm in the hangar deck i fix things i'm the chief
S0227	okay i'm er i i'm on the bridge i don't know
S0192	where where be you

S0192	okay so in your turn at the begin of the round you're gonna pick up these card that be list here i can have one yellow which be politics here
S0227	mm
S0192	two green which be leadership
S0227	mm
S0192	and two engineer here so everyone's get different card
S0227	yeah that's right yeah
S0192	and at the begin of your round you've gotta pick up that many card that's in your hand
S0227	okay
S0192	and your go have a effectively three stag the first stage be move you can move to a different location you can move around here or you can move onto a different ship you have a negative though if you're on this ship you have to discard one of these to move to this ship you know i say we all collect these
S0190	uhu mm
S0192	i'll tell you about that later you have three stag first stage move second stage be do an action this be where it get a little bite complicate the action can be either write on the board
S0227	oh it's not charades
S0192	no no
S0227	i be gonna say where's that
S0192	it say something on here
S0227	yes
S0192	so the action can either be something on the board it can be something write on one of these card or it can be your action that's on your thing here
S0227	okay
S0192	so you choose and you have another option you can pilot a ship as an action so you can like attack at cylon or do something
S0189	okay
S0192	oh that things beep again
S0227	yes i'm just gonna go and deactivate it
S0189	shall we start er dish out our card
S0192	yeah so i guess you go first i need to do the loyalty card first okay okay so i've make the deck of card
S0189	this be where we find out who's a cylon well if you're a cylon
S0227	i er i didn't see er the the er there be there wasn't a baltar in the er card be there
S0192	yeah there be
S0227	oh i didn't see that baltar i'd've go for baltar
S0192	do you wanna change
S0190	no
S0227	no
S0227	i'll stick with the admiral
S0192	okay right we're gonna get a card now one card just choose one don't look at it just choose it this be whether or not you're a cylon don't look at it
S0227	okay
S0192	get that one yeah nobody look at their card the reason i'm say that i'm gonna choose that one add the sympathiser in the reason i say that be because we find out if you be not a cylon it doesn't say anything on your card so you quickly look at your card and put it down but if you be a cylon it say something on your card
S0227	so you study it longer
S0192	so you study it so you know who's a cylon so
S0227	yes
S0192	we all need to look at our card at the same time for five second
S0227	okay right
S0192	so you can't tell who's a cylon or not
S0227	yes
S0192	be you ready
S0227	okay
S0192	so read your card one two three four five okay so hide your card that stay with you throughout the whole game
S0227	mm
S0192	okay right you go first
S0189	sure
S0192	so what be your colour here
S0189	right i need er er one purple
S0192	yeah
S0189	and two red
S0192	mm
S0189	and then i can either er pick two leadership or politics or be they the same thing
S0192	one or one or two and two
S0189	let's have one of each
S0192	one leadership one politics actually i make a very quick mistake everyone get to choose two card from their card set of the colour that you can have now at the begin of the game so which two do you want other two
S0189	which other two
S0192	yeah
S0189	in addition to these
S0192	yeah or even from the same colour
S0189	oh okay can i get one more tactic
S0192	yeah
S0189	purple one more red
S0192	okay there you go so which two would you like from your colour
S0190	erm i'll have one more leadership
S0192	okay
S0190	and one more politics please
S0192	okay there you be
S0227	i need to get my card cos i don't have any
S0192	yeah but when it come to your go you will
S0227	okay
S0192	yeah so which colour would you like
S0227	erm i need three erm leadership two tactic
S0192	but we only get two at the first round so just choose the colour and tell me which
S0227	alright i'll have one of each one green one purple
S0192	one green one purple there you go
S0227	be i allow to look at these
S0192	yeah course you be we use these to bet so if you look at the card it have a strength at the top
S0192	like a number between one and five and we use them to bet that's their strength but you can also use them in
S0227	be one good or or five good
S0192	five's good one's bad so three would be medium
S0227	mm okay
S0192	we use them to bet you'll see when it come round and it's also get an action on it so you can either choose to use the card for its action or you can bet with it and like do it
S0227	okay
S0192	as it go along right so you get your card be you gonna move
S0189	er right i have to move do i
S0192	you don't have to move
S0189	okay i'm not gonna move at the moment
S0192	okay and you can do an action
S0189	or
S0192	you have to do an action
S0189	okay so if i wanna do an action i should probably move to somewhere useful
S0192	yeah so these ship here can be destroy we don't want them to be destroy we wanna protect them so you probably wanna go into that area so that should any ship come over these be actually mean to be over here they will they'll attack you before they attack these
S0189	yeah okay that make sense
S0192	so you move there
S0189	yeah
S0192	cool now you get an action
S0189	well i take it i've only get one action then
S0192	once per game
S0189	yeah it say once per game
S0192	yeah
S0189	or card
S0192	yeah
S0189	yeah okay
S0192	or if you're in the ship you'd have more action
S0189	alright okay that's interest i might do a tactic one
S0192	what do it say
S0189	i've get one call launch scout
S0192	what do it do
S0189	which be risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher look at the top card of the crisis or destination dig and place it on the top or the bottom
S0192	okay so this be the crisis card do you wanna do that we only have four raptors in the whole game but you can risk them
S0189	i'll risk one
S0192	yeah okay so get rid of that card
S0189	well let's keep it here just so i know what happen
S0192	okay do you wanna roll the die
S0189	where be it here
S0192	yeah
S0189	so i need above a three six
S0192	and what happen
S0189	right look at the top of the crisis or destination deck right what would be a better pick
S0192	this be the crisis deck this be the destination deck probably the crisis deck
S0189	okay er so look right so i just get to see what's the next crisis be gonna be
S0192	you get to look how many do you get to look at what do it say
S0189	er just just say doesn't say so i assume one
S0192	so the top yeah so
S0189	yeah so it's mandatory test
S0192	you can't tell us
S0189	oh
S0192	this be just private for you
S0189	just me
S0192	mm
S0190	can't you put it to the bottom of the pack and take another one then
S0192	you could be a cylon you might want that against us or for us you don't know
S0227	that yeah
S0192	you can put it down and say it's good this be okay or it's bad or you can put i think you can put put it to the bottom of the deck it's your choice
S0189	okay
S0192	what do you reckon do you reckon you're gonna be able to play it
S0190	no
S0192	no
S0190	not at all i haven't a clue
S0227	it it's quite a tough tune isn't it
S0227	even i erm
S0190	it's
S0192	erm it's gonna take you about an hour to get to grip i think we need to go round like twice before we'll understand it i think
S0227	unfortunately there's no dummy run be there
S0192	yeah this be the dummy run nothing's gonna happen too much at the minute don't worry
S0227	no
S0192	if you don't want to we can stop
S0227	no no
S0190	no go on i'll have a go yeah but i'm just i don't see the point
S0227	we'll give it a go
S0192	at the minute
S0190	at the minute yeah
S0192	yeah fine
S0190	i don't see what we're try to do er to achieve
S0227	we're try to get to kobol
S0192	yeah
S0227	i do know that much
S0190	yeah but where's kobol
S0227	earth
S0190	yeah
S0192	we have to jump
S0227	jump
S0192	here so once we get up here
S0192	we jump and we go back to the start so we basically have to make this thing go up to the top and back down four time
S0190	right
S0192	and er
S0227	and eight
S0192	and we pull card here that tell us where we go
S0227	eight
S0192	now we lose if any of these the fuel the food the morale the population if any of these go down to zero we lose so certain card we pull be gonna say minus two of this or minus one of this
S0190	right
S0192	or something like that we have to bet to stop that from happen the cylons can attack you as well and these little things here these be like destruction on the ship so you can't use this area if it's get one on it
S0227	no
S0192	so they're they're try to attack you as well these things here be little population ship if you turn these for example it's get the sign of population people and the sign of morale so if this get destroy by this or one of these then we'd lose one of each on this one so it's all about lose these basically
S0227	mm
S0192	everything be try to kill your population kill your morale kill your food and kill your your fuel
S0189	yeah and er whoever's the cylon they'll want bad things to happen to the rest of the team
S0192	yeah
S0189	but not to not get find out
S0192	they don't wanna be obvious yeah
S0189	yeah
S0227	no
S0192	so you wanna keep it a secret so like now 's gonna draw his crisis card every round we play you draw one crisis card so
S0189	oh so i get to see what i be about to
S0192	yeah you can either put it back at the bottom and choose another one or or use that one
S0189	oh okay erm
S0192	you're gonna do that one now you can show us so now you put it down on the table
S0189	yeah okay
S0192	what be it so there's two symbols on the card usually this little sun mean jump so now we've draw this card this go up one okay so we're try to get up on this thing we've go up one because there's that sign this sign look like these little ship here and we don't have any on the board so because we have a basestar and we saw this sign the basestar launch one okay
S0227	okay
S0192	and that go on to the board
S0227	right
S0192	they're try to board galactica they're try to get on board and destroy us
S0227	mm
S0192	right if we pass it the president that's you look at one random loyalty card of anyone
S0227	when you when you pass what do you mean by pass it
S0192	okay so at the top of each thing there's a number thirteen
S0227	right
S0192	and there's the colour that you can use these have different colour
S0227	right
S0192	so we all have to bid together use these card we all have to bid and put them in in a pile and if we get above thirteen cumulatively we win and we pass if we get below if we fail it then we lose one morale and if we get above nine but we don't fail it nothing happen on this one
S0227	okay
S0192	so we've gotta vote for this so you've gotta have a look at your card
S0227	cos er i've only get two card i didn't have
S0192	yeah
S0227	right okay
S0192	at the minute
S0190	so have i
S0227	no cos it's not my game
S0192	at the minute we only do we don't have many card
S0227	yeah well i'm struggle erm not just the concept but but with my eye because erm to see this i need these but to read this i can't use these
S0227	so i'm kind of off on off on
S0192	it's not work
S0227	i need bifocals
S0192	you need one just a monocle on one eye
S0227	yes
S0189	so we're kinda screw
S0227	mm
S0189	because like we don't have many card on play
S0192	no and that be quite a high one to pick if i and it be damage us if i be you i'd've put that to the bottom
S0189	well i didn't know
S0192	no but that's fine
S0227	you do now
S0189	yeah oh no
S0192	it's happen
S0189	well
S0192	we can lose it and we just minus one morale that's all
S0189	er can we
S0192	so now everyone look at their card and say how much you can help in this bid you can't be explicit but you can say i can help a bite or i can help a lot and you could be lie
S0227	talk of dummy i
S0192	you could put in a negative card something that go against it
S0189	can we only give one card each
S0192	no you can give as many card as you want
S0189	right so if i have thirteen then i could put them all down
S0192	yes however there be a destiny deck so there will always be two random card in it you don't know what those card be so we need to try and be a bite higher than thirteen cos these could be two negative card
S0190	so we're all we're do be look to the at the number on the corner of the card
S0227	the the the
S0192	yeah just the number on the corner
S0227	right
S0190	it doesn't matter what they say they just
S0192	no
S0227	so it doesn't matter if it's
S0192	provide it's the right colour which on this one be yellow and green so it's quite restrict it doesn't do three of the colour
S0227	oh oh right so i can do one of my card
S0192	yeah
S0227	right
S0192	if you haven't get that colour the
S0227	or it's
S0192	or or if you're a cylon you could put a card of a different colour down
S0227	right
S0192	and you want them to lose so you're do that but you have to be careful because if you put too many they'll know that somebody be sabotage the bet
S0227	those other colour do they what do they do do they
S0189	they're negative
S0227	be they negative
S0192	they're negative against it yeah
S0227	right so if it be say
S0192	so i've pull two random card now they could
S0227	so okay
S0192	let's play this one out so we see what's happen here we
S0227	yeah that's why we er have a complete dumminy dummy run
S0192	so actually this be good for us
S0227	yeah
S0192	i pull two random card and they're both in favour and one be a five and one be a three so we're already at power eight
S0227	that's eight yes
S0192	so what actually you'll contribute last cos it's your go first so
S0227	okay i can help that with a four
S0192	yeah cool so you in the game you can't be explicit you can't say you can just say i can help a lot or i can pull my weight
S0227	oh oh okay so do i show that card or just
S0192	well normally in the game because we don't wanna know who's a cylon
S0227	yeah
S0192	we would put it face down
S0227	right
S0192	and then it get shuffle
S0227	okay
S0192	and then
S0227	let's do it i can help quite a lot
S0192	okay good
S0227	er but it's actually four just for the
S0192	yeah
S0227	this dummy run
S0192	cool so we'll play this one out
S0227	and it's green
S0192	cos it's a dummy run
S0190	right okay well i can help a fair bite
S0192	good nice yeah i can only a little bite unfortunately what be we on now then five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
S0189	i don't need to help
S0192	you don't need to you don't need to put anything down no
S0227	no
S0192	cool so we win
S0227	so everything stay the same
S0192	so we win that bet yeah so we didn't get the fail we didn't get the we pass it so now laura you actually have a bonus you can look at anyone's loyalty card and see if one of us be a cylon
S0227	what's our
S0192	which doesn't normally happen so early on in the game
S0227	what's our loyalty card be this one that we pick
S0192	the one that say whether you're a cylon or not
S0227	oh that one she can have a look at that
S0192	she can have a look at one person's
S0227	okay who she may suspect
S0192	yeah
S0227	okay
S0192	that doesn't normally come so quick in the game cos
S0227	no
S0192	you want that a bite later
S0227	those card that have just be put down where do
S0190	that could be anybody couldn't it
S0192	yeah
S0227	where where those card that we put down where do they go
S0192	back here we make pile of the use card and then we reshuffle them back in
S0189	so do she have to use that card now or can she keep it
S0192	er let me have a look actually do you have to use it now ah the president look at one random loyalty card of the current player doesn't say of anyone so she have to look at your loyalty card now
S0189	oh right
S0192	so show your loyalty card to now it's up it's at your discretion of whether or not you tell us whether he's a cylon or not
S0190	okay right
S0192	so you can give him back the card
S0190	okay
S0192	and now you know and it's your choice maybe you're a cylon and you don't wanna tell us that he be or he isn't but
S0190	no i'm not gonna say anything
S0192	no okay so cylon blatantly
S0227	mm
S0192	er okay dad your go
S0227	right erm
S0192	so you're here
S0227	yep
S0192	you can move anywhere on the ship
S0227	right i'm only limit to this ship i can't get
S0192	you can move to this ship but you have to discard one of these card that's in your hand as like a tax to do that
S0227	yeah yeah okay i'll i'll stay on my own ship
S0192	cool
S0227	so if i stay on my ship do i just throw the dice now or
S0192	well you can move to a different place you can choose anywhere you wanna move so do you wanna attack this basestar cos i mean it's quite dangerous have a big old basestar there
S0227	yeah okay yeah
S0192	yeah so you go to the weapons control
S0192	and it say action so now you do your action attack one cylon ship with galactica
S0227	right
S0192	so you now roll a die good roll
S0227	five
S0192	so you attack the cylon ship with galactica you damage it
S0227	right okay
S0192	so now you turn one of these at random do you want one two three or four
S0227	let's go for three
S0192	three so you get two it take three hit to destroy it
S0227	yeah
S0192	and that one hit count as two hit
S0227	yeah so it need only one more hit
S0192	so it only need one more hit to destroy it
S0227	to to to knock that out
S0192	yeah
S0192	good okay so now you draw your crisis card
S0227	and only look at it myself
S0192	you can show it to everyone now
S0227	be this the oh but would i normally do that or not
S0192	yeah you have to we have to all play the crisis
S0227	right so i have to take my glass off
S0189	to read it
S0227	erm surround
S0192	oh oh
S0227	instructions activate set up basestar one heavy raider seven raiders two raiders
S0192	okay
S0227	be be someone suppose to be erm set it up
S0192	we're get attack yeah dad's pull out a pretty bad card so
S0189	oh man we haven't have a good start
S0192	no
S0227	no
S0192	so the first thing that happen be we activate the basestar this basestar attack galactica
S0227	okay
S0192	so dad you need to roll the die again to see how damage we be
S0227	er er one bad or six bad
S0192	so here now the basestar's be attack
S0192	if it's with a basestar it's four to eight to damage us so you need lower than a four
S0227	i need a one then
S0192	yeah one two or three you get a one
S0189	yes
S0192	so we're okay
S0227	yes
S0192	now you don't know this yet but on some of your card it say things like you can add two to the die roll or minus two from the die roll so at this point if dad
S0227	yes
S0192	didn't get the roll that he need
S0227	i could've pull that
S0192	we could go i've get a card and that help
S0227	yeah
S0192	so you have to be careful to read some of them if it doesn't say action you can play it at any point
S0227	mm
S0192	there's some that don't say action so good so we save the basestar that's good but we're also surround so now all these new things come on the board so we get another basestar here
S0227	like we need one of those
S0192	we get four raiders
S0227	oh so that be quite a bad card to pick up wasn't it
S0192	yeah yeah it be a terrible card to pick up but by the way once we jump all this go and we start again
S0227	yes yeah i that
S0192	it clear the board
S0227	i er i understand that cos you're you're move to a different erm
S0192	location in in space
S0227	location in space yeah
S0192	we get another one of these negative ship that we don't wanna have destroy we get another one here we get two more of these things these be our ship these ones
S0227	they're vipers aren't they
S0192	yeah so you can go to a certain location like here and you can move them
S0227	right
S0192	you can move the ship to defend yourself
S0227	right
S0192	er okay oh there's four more bloody hell this be terrible
S0227	your mother wouldn't like this game she
S0190	pardon
S0227	your mum wouldn't like this game
S0227	she'd be go be it yahtzee no
S0192	erm and panic there's a special rule at the bottom you have to discard three skill card

S0192	so there you go but now you have to discard three because you get a negative effect
S0227	yes
S0189	discard some of the low number
S0192	yeah so look for a higher number
S0227	yeah er yes i know i've gotta discard three
S0189	so get rid of the one
S0227	and the one
S0189	and the one

S0192	but you're the president so you get two crisis card every time and you get to choose one so you see which one be if you're a cylon which one's worse for us or if if you're a human then which one's better for us effectively
S0190	so what do i what have i get to do now do i keep these
S0189	no you pick one
S0192	no you choose one for us to do as a group
S0190	
S0227	the the best or the worst er depend on if you're a cylon or a or a human
S0192	yeah so if you're a human pick one that's easy for us that doesn't damage us that much basically these card be always er try to damage you that's all they're try to do
S0227	yeah
S0192	be like damage your food
S0190	oh
S0192	damage your food you have to keep put skills in to stop that from happen
S0227	mm
S0192	maybe at this point in the game you don't know which be stronger or which be weaker so it's no problem just choose one
S0190	well i can't there isn't
S0227	er let her read them out and we can we can make a choice for her
S0192	shall i have a quick look
S0227	which would save
S0190	well we've get no one to to to do that have we i've get there's nobody in distress at the moment be there
S0192	no
S0190	so i can't do that
S0192	ah but this one like the distress don't when you read the card this be pointless it's just a quote and it's
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's a bite distract all you really gotta read be this bite at the bottom
S0190	right
S0192	so this one here the raiders if you see a sign that look like these ship
S0190	yeah
S0192	that mean that these get activate and they move
S0190	right
S0192	if you see this sign that mean that we go up one on the jump we want that
S0190	right yeah
S0192	but we don't want that
S0190	erm so
S0192	basically
S0190	right so
S0227	so if you be a cylon you'd go for that one rather than that one
S0190	you don't choose they both happen
S0227	oh they both happen
S0192	some of them you can see only there's only one
S0227	oh right okay
S0192	this one doesn't have the jump
S0227	right
S0192	so
S0190	so we'll go with the jump cos that's good isn't it
S0192	yeah so jump be good and this one be
S0190	yeah
S0192	just say admiral choose so basically you're the admiral so she's gonna give you this card and say you choose what do we do
S0190	okay
S0192	so what's the choice
S0227	oh i've get er i've get er the only choice i've get be to move er
S0192	do you want me to read it out
S0227	er yes
S0192	okay admiral choose do you wanna read it out get another voice on here
S0227	oh the oh you're still oh er you're record
S0190	oh you're not record this
S0189	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0189	it's perfect perfect talk
S0190	not to
S0189	right here we go admiral choose minus one to morale and the current player be send to sickbay
S0192	so that'd be
S0189	or minus one fuel and destroy one raptor
S0192	okay so either minus one morale and go to sickbay
S0227	mm
S0192	or minus one fuel and destroy a raptor
S0227	no i'll put her in sickbay
S0192	be you sure you wanna do that
S0227	er well er we're lose by put her in there she's have a rest we're lose resources with the alternative be be we not
S0192	you lose resources both ways you you always lose either one morale and send her to sickbay or lose one fuel and destroy a raptor so you're lose one of something
S0227	okay let's go for the lesser of two evils er
S0192	if go to sickbay then when it's her turn again she can only draw one card at the begin you cannot skill up with all your card you can only get one skill card so be in the sickbay or the brig be bad you don't wanna be there
S0227	okay so perhaps it's better to destroy a raptor
S0192	and a fuel
S0227	and a fuel
S0192	cool raptor do it definitely say fuel on there
S0227	erm de de de de
S0189	yeah one fuel
S0192	cool and one raptor
S0227	yeah one fuel and one and one raptor
S0189	yeah there's also a jump and er a
S0192	right so we go up one here and also the cylons attack so basically when we saw that these activate these things go clockwise around the board these things
S0227	oh that's just another thing to remember
S0192	yeah they go this way round the board
S0227	yeah
S0192	and they're try to destroy our ship
S0227	yes
S0192	or these things okay
S0227	yes
S0192	these things go either way round the board depend on which way be closer to this bite
S0227	right
S0192	so this one be clearly closer this way so it's just
S0227	yes
S0192	gonna go this way
S0227	right
S0192	and try so now these have activate these three move up one
S0189	oh no
S0192	these lot move up one
S0190	mm
S0192	and these lot move up one okay
S0227	right
S0192	so next time if they activate they're gonna try attack and these ship so
S0227	right
S0189	what happen if i get attack while i'm in that ship
S0192	you can be destroy and you go to the sickbay
S0189	oh right
S0227	right
S0192	but you can defend yourself also and we can give card to help you
S0189	okay well
S0192	no so that be your go now it's my go so i that one politics two leadership two engineer
S0227	so every time we go round we pick up our skills card
S0192	quotas yeah
S0227	our quotas
S0192	you can only have ten in your hand at any one er at the end of your go so if you pick up and you have twelve
S0227	yeah
S0192	that's okay until your go finish and then you've gotta discard down to ten
S0227	mm oh i've get
S0192	actually i have erm my negative be that i can only have eight in my hand
S0227	oh right
S0192	not ten
S0227	i've only get three at the moment
S0192	yeah that's fine yeah we've be bet okay so bloody hell we need to attack something because
S0227	we're not look we're not in good shape
S0192	we're be attack quite badly er okay i'm gonna attack basestar with galactica five
S0192	er it's damage so it's turn one
S0227	so another turn turn
S0192	yes so
S0227	need three of those doesn't it'
S0192	this yeah so that's damage that's destroy this er
S0227	be it destroy
S0192	this basestar's go it already have two and i give it another one
S0227	right and it's three to destroy it yeah so that's that's
S0192	yeah so we've get get rid of that one so it's my go i'm now gonna draw a crisis card okay power of nine colour purple and red
S0227	okay
S0192	now that's difficult 's the only one with reds
S0227	yes
S0192	so that doesn't make it easy pass we get one food we plus a food
S0227	right
S0192	so that doesn't happen very often fail minus one fuel and destroy one raptor
S0227	mm
S0192	so kind of the same as last time fuel and a raptor
S0227	yeah
S0192	or we just choose to lose one food we don't have to do the bet we can just take minus one food
S0189	shall we take the food loss i don't think we'll have an enough
S0192	well do we think how good be people for purple and red
S0189	not too good
S0227	er
S0192	your skills card no purple no reds
S0227	erm not bad
S0190	no
S0227	not bad but what's
S0189	i think
S0227	what's the score we're look for
S0192	nine
S0227	not bad
S0189	i think we should take the food
S0190	i don't have any
S0189	i think we should lose the food
S0192	you think we should lose it
S0189	mm
S0192	you can't help very much i can't help at all
S0190	i can't
S0192	can't help at all
S0227	er i can help but not enough
S0192	not enough so we just have to take the or on this scenario so the or be minus one food so we lose the food so also on this one it have those symbols again activate the raiders and also jump so we jump we go up one and now the raiders attack so the first thing they attack be here
S0227	right
S0192	so you've gotta roll the die
S0189	yeah
S0192	and hang on a minute if they get you lower that a five you're okay
S0192	so you need one to four and they're gonna attack you three time there's three of them
S0189	so i have to roll three time
S0192	yeah
S0189	oh no this be gonna get me destroy
S0192	so one you're good
S0192	two more time
S0189	oh
S0227	oh
S0192	eight oh that's destroy as well that's not even damage that's just destroy
S0189	so what's destroy
S0192	do anyone have a card it's usually a purple one that can lower the die roll by two i think it's purple
S0227	erm
S0192	it might be red
S0192	i don't i don't have any no
S0227	no no
S0192	there's one that say lower the die roll by two
S0192	cool right you
S0189	what's this what's this one
S0192	that's on the strength total
S0189	oh okay
S0192	that's like the total you can reduce it by two so get send to sickbay
S0189	oh
S0192	that thing go this have be destroy so this can never come back in the game again we lose that one
S0227	right okay
S0192	cos you get an eight normally they get damage and you can repair them
S0189	mm
S0192	no so his character now he's in the sickbay
S0189	for how long
S0192	until the next round you just take one card and come out
S0189	oh i see
S0192	erm and also one of these get through so it destroy one of these so choose one of these at random
S0189	erm right i'll this one
S0192	okay and turn it what do it say
S0189	population
S0192	one population so we minus one population so that's go from the game for good and also these all move round
S0227	oh good lord they're all in that box
S0189	they're come
S0192	so yeah
S0189	
S0227	we need to jump
S0192	so
S0189	we're gonna get destroy
S0227	so
S0190	what's that be that a good or a bad one
S0192	that's a bad that's a terribly bad one
S0227	that's a bad one
S0190	oh right
S0227	yeah
S0192	these ones be worse than these
S0192	these ones try and get in and once it get in it put a cylon token cylons have board and then if that token get up to here you lose
S0227	mm
S0192	so you don't want that to happen
S0227	right my go
S0192	actually no it be my go wasn't it
S0189	yeah
S0192	i'm still have my go and i didn't do a crisis card
S0227	oh right oh right okay
S0192	i don't think do i do a crisis card i do do a crisis card
S0189	yeah that be why
S0192	that's why everything happen so now it's 's go
S0189	okay so i need to
S0192	you're in sickbay
S0227	one card
S0192	you can only get one skill card
S0189	i'm gonna take erm a red
S0192	okay good idea
S0227	yeah that might be a good idea
S0192	oh oh god sorry it be stick to my drink
S0189	didn't even notice
S0190	put it on the erm marble hearth behind you it won't do any harm on there
S0192	mm
S0189	i've get good card
S0192	okay
S0189	maximum firepower
S0192	so
S0227	what do he he he can
S0192	you can move now
S0227	right so he take one only one card but he can actually move
S0192	he can still move he can move out of sickbay only the brig you can't in the brig you have to vote
S0227	mm mm yeah
S0192	until you get people out
S0189	right so can i move out and make an action
S0192	yeah i recommend can i give you a recommendation
S0189	so can i can i get in a viper and get here
S0192	yes you can you can get to the hangar deck and shoot yourself in a viper but you'll only get you'll get in this square but you won't fight this round cos that will count as an action and then it give you another action to move but you can't then take a third action
S0189	oh no
S0192	my recommendation to you would be to move these
S0227	yeah get em out of harm's way
S0189	can we move em both
S0192	yeah there's a thing here that say look at the back of two civilian ship these be civilian ship you may then move them to an adjacent area
S0189	okay
S0192	so you can have a look at these see how bad they be and then move them around so they get away from these guy
S0227	do we all see that or just
S0192	just so now you can look at the back of them
S0189	i dunno why oh we don't wanna move that
S0192	okay so and then move them round so they're out of harm's way
S0190	do they have to be move together
S0192	yes yeah well no you could move them in two separate directions
S0190	oh right i be gonna say yeah
S0227	don't wanna send em in there though
S0192	but no yeah you don't wanna send em that way
S0227	no
S0192	so yeah you've save those
S0227	right
S0192	and er now it's your crisis card
S0189	god right this be a choice for the president
S0190	okay
S0227	okay
S0192	be it start to make more sense
S0192	no
S0227	yeah
S0190	do you know what you're do
S0227	er it's make more sense i don't know totally what i'm do but
S0189	i think we should take the food loss
S0190	how many how much food have we can we afford to lose
S0192	well we're at seven if we get down to zero we we're bad
S0227	we're
S0192	population we have the most of but every time we jump these card pretty much always minus population
S0227	mm
S0192	so you kinda like lose ship as you
S0190	can we have a choice can i tell you would it
S0192	yeah you can tell us the choice
S0190	er it you've get we've either get to do minus one food or i've get to lose two of my skill card and 's get to lose three of his
S0192	and that's all that happen we don't lose any food or anything
S0190	yeah the choice
S0192	do you have the
S0192	do you have the skill card to get rid of
S0189	yeah
S0192	can you get rid of two and you get rid of three
S0189	yeah
S0192	yeah do that then maybe that's better than lose one of these cos we get the skill card again we never get that back again
S0227	unless she's a cylon and we're just we
S0192	and then i'm tell you
S0227	we shouldn't be listen to this at all
S0192	yeah who be the cylon be anyone the cylon
S0190	so i wanna keep the highest score don't i
S0192	yes
S0190	yeah
S0192	yeah keep the highest score
S0190	so i lose two
S0227	be there a possibility that none of us be cylons
S0192	there be a possibility that nobody be a cylon
S0227	be it more an interest possibility if we be all the cylons
S0192	there can only be one at this point in the game
S0227	oh right
S0192	so at this point now you know i say we need to jump and we need to get a score of eight
S0227	yes
S0192	when we get to a score of four we go into a sleeper phase where somebody wake up from be a cylon so we get deal another loyalty card and that mean that one of us be definitely a cylon and if one of if any one of these be in the red when we get to that phase if this be in the red any one of them then there's only one cylon in this game because we're already lose so
S0227	mm
S0192	they don't wanna make it too difficult but if we get to four out of eight and we're still in the blue somebody else will also be a cylon there will be two and it'll be two on two so it depend where we be on this tactically you can actually try and make this just get into the red just when that happen so that you don't get a second cylon
S0192	but that's get a bite complicate you get rid of a red one okay
S0227	right so it's my go own isn't it
S0189	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	i pick up two green and erm oh two green er three green and two purple
S0192	three green and two purple there you go
S0190	so do we get this every time each round
S0192	every time yeah
S0190	every round okay
S0192	so you can get rid of them there's
S0227	well that's not a brilliant hand
S0192	yeah i've get a lot of low card
S0189	me too
S0192	we're actually quite heavily under attack at the moment
S0227	right shall i take a what's it's call card now
S0192	you haven't move yet
S0227	oh oh of course i've gotta move before i take my
S0192	now there's a very sneaky one here call ftl control you can actually jump us prematurely if you want to
S0227	yeah
S0192	you can go to this location and jump us
S0227	ftl faster than light
S0192	yeah so you can jump us prematurely once we're out of the red and we're in the blue which we're in now
S0227	yeah
S0192	you can jump early
S0227	yeah i think
S0192	but when you jump you roll a dice if you lose you minus three population if you jump at this point
S0227	right
S0192	if you lose here you minus one population if you jump at this point
S0227	right
S0192	so jump early bear a risk on your population
S0227	right
S0192	but you can do it
S0227	well look
S0189	i think it'd be worth it
S0227	look at er
S0192	do you think it's worth it
S0227	well look at it tactically erm we've get a load we could clear all this all this space
S0192	mm
S0227	of
S0192	get everything off the board
S0227	death star and that but i've gotta get a a die that be lower than three
S0192	lower than a er you gotta get a seven or an eight to be okay
S0227	seven or what on the dice oh course it go oh course it's it's not it's not cuboid be it yeah
S0192	no
S0227	that's er chance of that be gonna be
S0227	be eight
S0192	hang on let me just have a quick look it go up to eight
S0227	erm
S0192	ftl jump the current player roll the die and if a six or lower be roll then you lose the population so you need a seven or an eight to be okay
S0227	right so basically
S0192	so can anyone help with dad's die roll in any way again i think it's purple i think it's tactics
S0192	be you gonna jump early or be you gonna do a different move
S0227	oh i've get a
S0189	think it's worth it
S0227	i've get a seventy six percent chance of not of not get it
S0189	yeah but we still jump we just lose some population
S0190	can i use this one
S0227	yeah
S0190	can well what about this one then
S0192	let's have a look so this one say play after strength be total okay so this one be the same one have before that's a skill check so whereas we have the card that say oh that one doesn't have one this one have a power of six let's say we'd skilled up we total it up and we only get four but this card allow you to reduce this power by two
S0190	oh right
S0192	so
S0190	so it doesn't reduce what 's get to get on that one
S0192	doesn't reduce the roll no
S0227	right okay right
S0192	the the i think the one we're look for be a purple one dad might have it in your purple card
S0227	and what's the purple one gonna say
S0192	do you have one that say like reduce the die roll by two or something
S0227	erm
S0192	let's have a look see if there's any in here that say it so i can show you
S0189	strategic plan maybe
S0227	yes it's the purple's strategic plan but erm erm
S0192	ah here this one say play before any die roll to add two to the result but actually you do wanna add two to the result
S0227	yeah
S0192	cos you could get a four and then it give you six do you know what i mean
S0227	so er could i use my two if i get a six would that give me eight
S0192	yeah have you get one that say that
S0227	yes
S0192	yeah so you add that in now and you gotta play it before the die roll not after
S0227	oh right oh i see right how about if i've get two of them
S0192	you can only use one per round
S0227	damn it okay so i'm gonna use one of those
S0192	okay
S0227	so if i get er so now
S0192	so now you've better your chance
S0227	i've so i've gotta get six or higher
S0192	you've gotta get five or higher
S0227	five or higher
S0192	yeah
S0227	right
S0192	you can do it
S0189	yes that'll do
S0192	score you didn't even need it nice
S0227	it be better to to have have it and
S0192	so we jump
S0227	yes
S0192	and we didn't lose any population so this go back to zero
S0227	yeah
S0192	and all these things come off
S0227	come off yeah
S0192	include our own ship
S0227	yeah
S0192	you can help
S0227	where do these go
S0192	just back where they belong there
S0227	where do that go i yeah i didn't know where
S0227	so that's actually be quite helpful
S0192	yeah you've clear the board
S0227	yes
S0192	so we're back to square one
S0227	yeah
S0192	we're not in trouble any more
S0227	no
S0192	although i add an i we add a rule to the game where every time we jump a basestar follow us that's our own rule
S0227	okay
S0192	we can choose whether or not to play that because sometimes when you jump and you clear the board it can take age before you get a card that bring cylons back on
S0227	okay yeah for a bite of spice
S0192	and it can be a bite bore so kinda like
S0227	yeah we like it we like it spicy
S0192	just make sure that there's always something against you rather than
S0227	yes that's good do i need to pick up oh i pick up some card didn't i
S0190	mm
S0192	yeah
S0190	you need one of those other ones don't you
S0227	i need to pick up er one of those ones
S0192	you need one of the crisis card don't you
S0227	and everyone get to see this do they not
S0192	yes
S0227	right erm
S0189	do you want me to read it out for you
S0227	yeah please do
S0189	right raid party activate cylon raiders
S0192	right yeah
S0189	do you wanna do this one there's a lot to it
S0192	yeah ah it's another one of these again we just jump and already there be this er
S0192	these card aren't that common so
S0227	yes
S0192	unlucky
S0227	why do i
S0192	so let's ignore the fact that i say let's put one down
S0227	yes
S0192	let's not do that cos that'll make it too difficult so
S0227	cos that'll give us two basestars won't it
S0192	well you yeah no it'll give us to basestars so we set this up again
S0227	that be a great
S0192	we just jump and they be back instantly
S0189	thank dad
S0227	they they follow us

S0192	so no move
S0189	yeah
S0190	right so don't i have to er take one of those other card
S0189	crisis
S0192	yeah so you do your action
S0190	i do my action
S0192	yeah and now
S0190	and i move it into the other
S0192	and now you take one of these card
S0190	now i have to take one of those
S0192	but you get two and you get to choose one of them that's just your
S0190	right how many can i have of these
S0192	they go back every time you don't keep them
S0190	oh right i'm
S0192	have you be keep them
S0190	i've get load here
S0227	no the erm
S0192	no they're your special quorum card
S0227	no
S0192	that one however should've come back
S0190	right
S0192	these be different
S0190	right okay
S0192	so you've get your loyalty card in there and then you've get your special quorum card but this one should've go back
S0190	right so oh yes erm
S0192	oh we jump earlier sorry didn't do this when we jump the the admiral get two of these card
S0190	oh
S0192	and get to have a look at them and decide which one we choose
S0227	only me
S0192	so remember we're try to get to a power of eight so you need to choose either one that take us far but be damage or one that doesn't take us so far and be less damage what do you think i think he's struggle to read it
S0227	no i can read it it's just erm er you be say about the numerical order on the erm be the higher the numerical order the better or lower
S0192	so let's have a look at these ones together normally you'd look on your own one's get a three and one's get a one
S0227	yes
S0192	we wanna get further so we want the three but the three have a negative lose three fuel
S0227	yes the fuel yes exactly
S0192	which be pretty pretty bad erm
S0227	but that get us three up here doesn't it '
S0192	yeah but we need to get to eight and another jump
S0227	yeah
S0192	and that would take er nearly half of our fuel away the other one
S0227	how much fuel do it take away
S0192	three
S0227	oh right well yeah that's yes
S0192	yeah
S0227	so we're gonna have to go for the er
S0192	the other one be a one and it say lose one fuel
S0227	and i've gotta roll a dice
S0192	and then you can roll a die and maybe gain two fuel
S0227	yes that
S0192	so which one do you wanna choose
S0227	it's get to be the latter er hasn't it
S0192	okay so this one we didn't do
S0227	right
S0192	we've now jump to a stage of one so one of eight isn't that didn't jump us very far at all
S0227	no
S0192	erm so now you roll a die
S0227	and do we lose a raptor
S0192	erm we may may risk a raptor to roll a die
S0227	right and what
S0192	if three or higher gain two fuel
S0227	right
S0192	otherwise if it's one or two we destroy the raptor
S0227	right so i've gotta get higher than three
S0192	yeah well three or higher nice so we actually gain two fuel so that help us so we go up to nine
S0227	right okay
S0192	cool
S0190	now what do i do with these two card
S0192	er they're your crisis
S0190	yeah
S0192	so now it's your crisis you choose one
S0190	yeah okay
S0192	if you're a cylon choose one that damage us if you're a human choose one that help us
S0227	okay i don't pick one of those card up yet
S0192	that wasn't your go
S0227	okay
S0192	it's just we kinda go back a bite
S0227	okay right
S0190	okay we'll have to use this one then can i show you
S0192	okay yeah so that's what we're play
S0190	yeah that's the one we're discard
S0192	and that's the one we're discard oh good yeah that one's dangerous
S0190	yeah
S0192	they're actually both bad yeah
S0190	yeah well
S0192	so what do this one say
S0190	that's
S0192	admiral choose do you wanna read it dad
S0227	er read it to me son
S0189	sure
S0227	er but if he's a cylon he'll be could completely
S0227	load of gobbledygook
S0192	say something different
S0189	er i'll tell you there's only one choice
S0227	mm
S0189	right this be call rescue mission the choice be either minus one morale and the current player be send to sickbay or minus one fuel and destroy one raptor
S0192	so we actually play this card before
S0189	yeah
S0192	we do do a similar card
S0227	be the be there a roll of the die for this or not
S0192	so one morale and go to sickbay
S0227	yes
S0192	or one fuel and lose a raptor
S0227	well 's gonna have to go to sickbay be be probably the
S0192	okay you go to sickbay
S0190	be the raptors good then
S0192	we get er we only get four of them in the whole game so you can't keep risk them
S0227	yeah so if destroy them if we can't we can't really risk em you'll just have go back to to sickbay
S0190	i haven't be to sickbay yet have i
S0189	no
S0190	oh yes i have
S0192	no go to
S0190	no it be
S0192	go to sickbay
S0190	yeah no
S0227	have
S0190	okay then
S0189	we've we've lose one anyway
S0190	erm
S0189	it's your choice so
S0227	yes well 's go to sickbay
S0192	's go to sickbay so minus one morale
S0227	yeah
S0192	and go to sickbay
S0190	oh
S0192	sorry
S0227	right and this card go
S0190	okay
S0192	that go over here
S0190	quite use to that
S0192	erm okay that be your go
S0189	my go
S0227	whose go be it now
S0192	mine one politics two leadership and would you grab me two blue ones thank you very much
S0190	one
S0192	one
S0190	two
S0192	two thank okay okay what action be i gonna do mm i think i think we need to attack a basestar still i'm still here so i'm gonna do that where's the die one
S0227	oh
S0192	nothing happen
S0192	er that that be my go
S0227	right okay
S0190	oh
S0192	that be terrible so i do a crisis card okay this one be the power of twelve green and yellow can people help much on that
S0189	not really
S0192	we pass it we fail it also these activate
S0190	i can help quite a lot
S0192	nice
S0227	i i can help quite a lot
S0192	so can i
S0189	i can't really help
S0192	so if we win this then i get to look at someone's loyalty card mm
S0227	loyalty card which one's
S0192	the one that say whether you're a cylon or not
S0227	oh i see right yeah yeah mm
S0192	i'm a little suspicious of at the minute so mm
S0227	yeah i'm er tend to have a lean towards that as well
S0192	so we'll see
S0190	be that because i'm the only woman
S0189	no maybe
S0190	right so perhaps i won't let you have my card then
S0190	and then you can't
S0192	so these two actually move round and that's terrible luck cos once these get in we're screw
S0227	right
S0192	we go up one other jump track and now we bet so this be face down so we don't know so if you're a cylon now you wanna try and sabotage this but chance be
S0227	right be this the we're try to get fourteen aren't we
S0192	twelve yeah
S0227	twelve
S0190	so be it to my advantage to give it to you or not if you're if you're go to erm
S0192	be you a cylon then
S0190	i'm not gonna
S0227	if you're if you're a if you're a cylon you don't although you've get the card you don't have to play them do you
S0192	no you don't have to play them
S0227	no
S0192	you could put in the colour that negate it
S0227	yes
S0192	you could put in red and and blue and whatever
S0227	yes
S0192	so it go against it
S0227	yes
S0192	however if we put these card out turn them and there's like five negative card in there we know that somebody's definitely it's not just this random chance card
S0227	right
S0192	somebody's cos er i just put two random ones in
S0227	right
S0192	these could be for or against us
S0227	okay
S0192	therefore there could always be two negative card in the pack so if someone put a negative one these be both negative then we definitely know someone's a cylon cos there's three negative card
S0227	right
S0192	but it's a risk you take as a cylon be the cylon
S0192	okay how much can you help put in
S0189	only a little bite what colour be it
S0190	green or yellow
S0192	green or yellow
S0189	okay
S0192	good dad be you put in
S0227	i can yeah do you have to show them or just put them down face down
S0192	just put them face down you don't wanna show em
S0227	right okay
S0192	
S0190	i don't really know what i'm suppose to be do to be honest
S0192	erm
S0190	you want
S0192	put point to win power of twelve
S0190	yes
S0192	with your colour green or yellow
S0190	yeah
S0227	have you get green or yellow
S0190	yes i i know i've get to use green or yellow card yes i know that
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos you don't necessarily have to
S0192	if you're human
S0190	ah so be it
S0192	if you're not then you're gonna wanna play it a little bite differently you want us not to do this
S0189	but you wanna not tell us
S0190	so do you want as many er as high a score in there as possible or not
S0192	yes to pass this
S0227	yes
S0190	right
S0192	this bet
S0190	okay er
S0189	okay
S0192	just one
S0227	just one
S0192	er just put one in okay
S0227	oh i think that she have more than
S0190	how many have you get to do
S0227	as many
S0192	twelve between all of us
S0190	alright then i'll put two in
S0192	okay i'm gonna i'll
S0190	i don't know what i'm do anyway so difference
S0227	you're win by the way
S0192	that's the thing we're all on the same team really so it's at the minute
S0189	well unless someone be a cylon
S0192	okay i'm gonna put another one in someone should be a cylon whoever they be
S0227	i think someone be
S0190	yeah i think someone be i know who it be
S0192	cos you already look
S0190	pardon
S0192	well it must you then mustn't it it's either you or
S0189	why be you be suspicious of me bro
S0227	mm
S0192	i should probably say at this point if you be a cylon there's something special that you can do if you be a cylon
S0190	mm
S0192	you can reveal yourself as a cylon at any point in the game when you reveal you get rid of all your skill card you can't do the special abilities that's on your card and you no longer on this ship you move to the cylon area and you have different abilities that you can do and only you can do and you also receive a super crisis card which be like one of these but worse
S0227	mm
S0192	basically for us for the humans
S0227	yeah
S0192	but if you be a cylon and your people aren't sure that you're a cylon it's better to stay unrevealed cos you can do more
S0227	more damage
S0192	subtle damage at the begin
S0227	you yes it's better to be on the inside of the tender
S0192	yeah
S0227	er rather than on the outside
S0192	once you get up here you can get a bite stick with what you do so
S0227	yeah
S0189	what happen if you're not a cylon but you claim to be a cylon
S0227	well
S0192	you can do that also we've have that in a game
S0227	oh right
S0192	someone claim to be a cylon
S0227	oh right
S0192	we just put him in the brig
S0189	so do that make you a a sympathiser
S0227	they'd just go to the brig
S0192	yeah
S0227	it's the same erm so do you count those card now or
S0192	yeah so i shuffle these up and see
S0189	so be that what you do you just put em in the brig
S0192	yeah you can do yeah if you think they're a cylon
S0189	but like they don't get to go to the cylon side
S0192	so if we think 's a cylon now we should probably put her in the brig
S0189	but how would we check that she be
S0192	she can get to be she can still reveal but she doesn't get the special ability on her reveal card if she's in the brig
S0227	mm
S0192	so some special ability right pair of three six nine that's eleven thirteen fifteen we've win it so far but what oh god minus three we're down to twelve back up again sixteen we've easily do it nice so either somebody put one in somewhere and 's the only one with pilot
S0227	it's not rocket science
S0189	i'm not the only one
S0192	or both of those card be from here
S0227	yes
S0192	we don't know
S0227	no
S0192	cos there's only two
S0227	so we're
S0192	so there's a chance that nobody be the cylon
S0227	we're no really wiser
S0192	mm
S0227	not really if there be three
S0192	yeah
S0227	we'd know definitely that
S0192	we'd know definitely
S0227	that that someone be a
S0192	someone be a cylon
S0227	cylon yeah
S0192	but now my cylon radar have change direction from and and go to
S0189	why do you suspect me
S0192	cos your laugh too much
S0189	know the truth
S0227	er what happen now then when we've we've
S0192	so 's already see that you're a cylon and be choose not to tell us be that be that the way it go
S0190	i'm not gonna say anything i mean it might be er detrimental to my position
S0227	be erm
S0192	you yeah you could become a cylon
S0227	we we pass that erm so what happen now we we didn't fail it
S0192	now we pass it so i get to look at someone's loyalty card
S0227	okay
S0192	so who do i trust the least basically
S0227	yeah yes
S0192	at the minute i trust the least so
S0192	give me your loyalty card
S0227	and you can now choose to expose him or or
S0192	be not a cylon
S0227	yes
S0192	so we know who be a cylon
S0189	mm
S0227	either that or my poker face be be brilliant
S0192	yeah pretty damn good okay where be we so we just finish that it's your go we definitely know 's cool
S0227	mm
S0192	if you suspect
S0189	mm
S0227	you can't become a cylon though can you because of
S0192	you can become a there's another cylon card in here
S0227	oh right cos i think in in the film you couldn't become one you either be one cos you're not human
S0192	there's a sleeper agent
S0227	oh right
S0192	so you you wake up
S0227	oh you
S0192	and you yeah
S0227	oh i see so you be actually one but you don't realise you're one
S0227	right oh i see yeah
S0189	right can i get my one purple
S0192	yeah
S0189	two reds and er who's get lot of leadership
S0192	er we can all get green i think
S0227	yeah
S0189	but how many people can get yellow
S0227	i can get
S0190	i can get yellow
S0227	i can get the most leadership
S0192	i can get yellow and green
S0190	so can i
S0227	i can only get green and and
S0189	one green one yellow then
S0227	i can get three green every time
S0192	okay one green one yellow
S0227	all the green be all the green be
S0192	you might wanna try and get in the brig if we think she's a cylon
S0189	how do we do that
S0190	there's an awful lot of talk might erm just might be you
S0192	it might be me mightn't it
S0227	yeah
S0190	yes it might just be so er
S0227	yeah
S0189	so how to we get in the brig
S0227	yes
S0192	's not convince
S0190	that's entirely up to
S0190	he can choose what he like
S0189	how do we actually get anyone in the brig
S0192	to get her in the brig we have to go to the admiral's quarter this position and then we vote to get her in there now if she be a cylon she can vote against that
S0227	mm
S0192	to stop us from get her in the brig but it's quite low it's only a seven to get her in
S0227	mm
S0192	but it's purple and green and i don't have any purple
S0190	neither do i
S0227	be it purple
S0192	mm to get someone in the brig
S0227	i've get i've only get three of them

S0189	dangerously close to me
S0192	yep

S0227	not good
S0192	we've be damage so you need now to choose one of these at random we've get one two three four five six seven
S0227	i'll take two
S0192	two
S0227	yeah
S0192	turn it see the picture on it that's command that's that currently be damage so we cannot use this area

S0189	well didn't they attack
S0192	no only the basestar attack
S0189	oh okay
S0192	that symbol just mean the basestar attack erm what else get set up so do you wanna jump into one of these oh you're already in one
S0190	mm
S0192	you could potentially jump into another one if you be somewhere else on the board erm
S0189	couldn't i technically jump into that one and take my action
S0192	yeah you can do that
S0189	i wanna do that then
S0192	yeah alright
S0189	okay and i'll just say i'll stay there and attack one of these

S0227	what's he gotta get
S0192	he's gotta get a three to eight to destroy her nice so one of these be go
S0189	good
S0192	okay that be worth do special rule train new pilot keep this card in play until the fleet jump each unman viper suffer a minus two penalty to its attack roll
S0189	oh no
S0192	so while this be currently in play when you're attack with er er maybe we should've probably happen before that you get minus two on your on the die that you just roll so that stay in play for now okay
S0190	this be your go isn't it
S0192	yeah
S0227	yes
S0192	that be your it's your go
S0190	have you get take have you take your crisis card

S0227	oh yeah yeah
S0192	so any ones even if they're against that
S0227	okay
S0192	colour
S0227	oh right yes
S0192	help us
S0227	so a two wouldn't but a one would
S0192	that's your special ability yeah
S0227	yeah yeah okay
S0192	that's your special ability you have another special ability once per game after resolve a skill check which be this instead of discard the skill card so all those skill card in that pile that we put back you can keep those card
S0227	even though it's more than
S0192	yeah
S0227	the ten
S0192	but that's only one once per game you can do that
S0227	right okay
S0192	so everyone have a once per game thing and then a thing that you can do every time
S0190	right i've get in here it say a pass and a fail or something else
S0192	yeah so you can just choose the or without do the vote or we can vote and get the pass or fail
S0192	oh
S0227	mm
S0192	i need a glass of water
S0227	mm
S0192	oh can i drink it
S0189	i dunno whose it be
S0192	oh it's mine
S0190	no yours be behind you
S0189	er oh be that mine
S0192	they're both mine
S0190	yeah
S0227	let's stop in fifteen for a quick erm make a cuppa tea or get a drink or something
S0192	you keep it now
S0189	well i just have a sip out of it be you that disgust by my
S0227	mm remember you do that as a child you always er like something of his ice cream you'd erm take a mouthful out of it
S0189	do i
S0227	and he he'd say there you go you have it he wouldn't touch it again after that
S0192	cheer
S0189	you be eat mushroom and all sort
S0227	mm
S0192	what be you think
S0190	i'm think
S0189	she's plot
S0190	i can't if i do the first one with the pass and the fail on or i have to do the other one i can't it doesn't seem to make sense or maybe i'm just totally thick
S0192	no not at all let's have a look
S0190	right
S0192	so this one
S0190	er yeah
S0192	if we pass and beat twelve we plus a fuel that's a good thing
S0190	right
S0192	if we fail it we didn't make twelve then we minus a fuel and destroy a raptor
S0190	mm
S0192	or instead of try to do the skills check
S0190	yeah
S0192	you can just roll a die and if it's four or lower we minus a fuel
S0190	so there's bad but
S0192	so you've get like this one be fifty fifty
S0190	so er
S0227	yeah
S0190	right
S0192	either nothing happen or we win a fuel
S0190	so that one if i do that one we just pass
S0192	if we pass it nothing happen so we're okay
S0190	happen that's better isn't it
S0192	if we get seven plus the current player discard two skill card and if we fail it we lose a morale normally this card would be better
S0190	right
S0192	however this card have a plus of fuel and you don't very often get plus something
S0190	right okay
S0192	so it's worth try to do that
S0190	right
S0192	so you might wanna ask people how good be you for purple and red and probably we'll find we're not very good for purple and red so
S0190	be you
S0227	what what's the the number
S0190	we've get to make twelve
S0192	so how much can everyone contribute for purple and red
S0190	nothing
S0227	erm
S0189	very little
S0192	i can't help at all
S0190	neither can i
S0192	so we don't want that one
S0190	no
S0192	we're not gonna pass it so
S0190	no okay so
S0192	let's get rid of that one
S0190	okay
S0192	and we'll put the other one on
S0189	
S0227	no
S0192	some different character have more reds and more purple we've pick character that have like
S0227	mm
S0192	no reds really no purple so nine pass no effect seven plus you discard two skill card if we fail we lose a morale and you also discard two skill card we jump up one and the heavy raiders launch there isn't any on the board so we launch one out of this basestar and we launch one out of this basestar so we get two of those on the board and now we need to vote nine yellow and green
S0190	mm
S0227	yellow and green
S0192	so we get two from the destiny deck i go first i can only help a little bite
S0227	i can only help a little bite
S0190	i can help a lot
S0192	good
S0189	i can't help
S0192	can't help at all okay

S0227	and what's the score we're look for
S0192	twelve nine
S0227	there you go you add em up
S0192	right cool so we still don't know if
S0227	shuffle
S0192	anyone's a cylon yet
S0227	no shuffle em first
S0192	oh dad's a cylon he might be request we shuffle
S0227	mm just follow the rule
S0192	glad no one suspect me
S0190	be you quite sure about that
S0227	mm
S0189	we should hold a vote
S0192	yeah right nine so four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve wow seventeen minus one sixteen seventeen twenty one oh minus three i think we do it oh minus five who put that in there somebody have definitely put a sneaky card in there interest who can get purple
S0190	you
S0192	not me i can't get purple
S0190	can't you
S0192	no purple
S0190	oh okay
S0192	you can't either
S0190	no
S0192	dad can get purple
S0190	yes
S0227	mm
S0192	but it may not have be a purple it could've be a a blue but somebody's put something in there so it's five six seven eight nine against and what do i say
S0190	we be up to seventeen at one stage
S0189	what be we look for
S0190	twelve aren't we
S0192	twenty two minus nine we do it
S0227	we've do it
S0192	but somebody try to sabotage us there and i know it's not
S0189	mm
S0192	who do you think it be bro
S0189	could be dad
S0192	do you reckon
S0189	i dunno we think it be but now i'm not sure
S0192	she be make us think it be her okay that be your crises crisis my go one yellow
S0189	have you use any of these card yet
S0190	nope
S0189	she's get them but she doesn't use them
S0227	she's stack em up
S0189	they're probably all too beneficial for us
S0227	mm
S0189	cos she's a cylon so
S0192	not help us okay we have quite a bite of stuff on here do you think i should jump
S0227	yes
S0192	and risk it
S0227	if you can
S0192	yeah
S0227	well we're we're in the right position to jump aren't we
S0192	we'll risk three population but i mean we jump last time and nothing happen so
S0227	yeah
S0192	shall we risk it again
S0227	yes
S0192	do anyone have something to add minus
S0192	be there any way of do that
S0227	in what in
S0189	add to the roll
S0192	yeah we don't wanna we do wanna add to the roll do anyone have one that add to the roll it's a purple one i think
S0189	could we add a a negative to a roll
S0190	when be i suppose to use these card
S0192	erm let's have a look at what they be
S0190	hang on hang on hang on
S0192	not the loyalty card yeah
S0227	i've get action risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher
S0189	no it's not that one
S0227	that's not it it's not that one either
S0192	so this one allow you to draw two politics card er whenever you use it and then you give it to somebody and then so basically this one so 's get a card that say she can draw two of these card and give this to someone whoever she give this to when we jump the admiral doesn't choose this whoever she give this to choose this
S0189	mm so if
S0192	er
S0189	if we don't trust the admiral
S0192	yeah
S0227	mm
S0192	then we can give this so if you don't trust the admiral if you think that he's a cylon and when we jump he's gonna choose where we go he's already give us a low one last time one
S0227	mm
S0192	not three
S0227	mm
S0192	then you could give this card to say me and then i get to choose these card next time
S0190	mm
S0192	this one you draw two politics card keep this card in play while this player be not the president other players may not be choose with the administration location so it's basically say if you give this to me while i'm not the president we cannot elect a new president here with this thing so it's just say that that doesn't work basically and the last one just as it say destroy that one's pretty good this one say destroy three raiders that's three of these
S0192	one heavy raider or one centurion
S0227	but you wouldn't wanna do that if you be a cylon
S0192	then roll a die so you could help us destroy some of this stuff
S0189	but we're gonna jump
S0190	but when do i use them
S0192	for your action so you move and then you choose an action
S0190	right
S0192	and that's an option
S0227	like say if if we're gonna jump and be successful that would be an irrelevance wouldn't it
S0192	no yeah so i'm gonna roll i need a seven or an eight to be okay ah do anyone have anything to add to the die roll
S0227	what's that no
S0192	six no so we minus three population
S0189	oh
S0227	and we don't jump
S0192	we do jump
S0227	oh we do yeah
S0192	but with minus three population so clear the board
S0227	board and we leave one of these on be we leave it where be we put it
S0192	yeah we leave it
S0190	can we take everything off
S0192	yeah
S0190	oh
S0192	oh gosh
S0227	er can these come off
S0192	that's 's piece
S0190	oh right
S0227	everything's off
S0192	these all go into the hangar there
S0227	these ones here
S0192	yeah they go over there just in the cylon pile
S0227	that's another one of those what's it's call
S0192	that go there
S0227	right
S0192	okay so we jump that be my move i'm now pull a crisis
S0227	er we're probably back to square one
S0189	another annihilation
S0192	right we go up one oh so we jump dad you get to choose two of these card
S0227	right do i er just see if
S0192	cylon that could be
S0227	i see them just myself don't i
S0192	yeah
S0190	but do you say do you say that i need to use one of these card but i've get to wait till my
S0192	yeah you've gotta wait till your turn now
S0190	right okay
S0192	but you could've select me to choose these rather than dad erm win that card he select two now to look at but when you give me that card i can look at three so it increase my chance of pick a decent one as well
S0227	do i read this out to you or not
S0192	no you gotta choose as the admiral we don't know whether you're a cylon or not so it's your choice
S0227	how many raptors have we get leave
S0192	three you can sacrifice a raptor if you need to if it's worth it we wanna jump far if there's a three that might be good
S0189	there isn't many raptors what be the other ship we get
S0192	these erm vipers
S0227	we're look at the numerical er figure at the bottom aren't we
S0192	yeah
S0227	can we afford to lose two fuel
S0192	we get quite a bite of fuel we've get above what we start with
S0227	okay
S0192	so i'd say we probably can
S0227	so what do i do now just say to you
S0192	you choose one
S0227	do i reveal it
S0192	yeah
S0189	i don't think you have to reveal the other option though
S0192	no you don't reveal the option you didn't choose
S0227	no i'm not go to
S0192	okay so give me that one
S0227	lose two fuel
S0192	so we don't know what this one be
S0227	no that give us two towards the aim doesn't it
S0192	so we only jump two yeah so we're not even at the sympathiser stage
S0227	mm
S0192	next time we jump there will be another cylon there will definitely be a cylon next time we jump
S0227	mm
S0192	so we're now up to three we lose two
S0189	someone's definitely a cylon now

S0189	yeah
S0227	the coup fail
S0189	here we go this one's call elections loom
S0192	mm
S0189	we have to roll and eight which be only yellow and green if we win there's no effect if we fail there's minus one no if we get less than a five we lose one morale if we fail we lose one morale and the president discard four skill card
S0192	oh that's quite a lot how many do you have
S0190	two
S0192	only two so that's not an option then
S0192	let's have a look
S0189	what would happen if she just lose two
S0192	she can't
S0192	she have to have four to discard
S0189	so surely we can still fail
S0227	no it mean
S0192	let's have a look
S0227	it mean you're only you're force to do one only one of only one thing
S0192	i mean yeah fail if i guess in this scenario when it's an option to lose four if she doesn't have four you can't take the option
S0227	no
S0192	but if it's fail and she only have two then that's fine
S0189	yeah so shall we just let it fail
S0227	you've get no option
S0192	you still have to vote on it regardless of whether it fail or not
S0189	yeah
S0192	so we need to make a new destiny deck for a start we need two of each colour so be we vote on it it's your choice
S0189	yeah
S0192	and it's power of eight how much can people help
S0227	what's the colour
S0192	yellow and green
S0227	no
S0192	you're funny when you're look at your card that close
S0227	i know because

S0192	what do you mean we do have any
S0189	oh they get put back when do we them back in

S0190	right
S0192	what do you need
S0190	three
S0227	you'd only get that on the crisis
S0190	erm three yellow and two green please
S0192	three yellow and two green

S0190	that's all i've get now where would i like to move i've only get one green oh no i haven't sorry
S0192	you get it
S0190	it's stick okay where would i like to move
S0192	so we're not too far from jump i guess you could attack one of these if you want to
S0189	might be against what she want
S0192	yeah if she's a cylon
S0189	i think so
S0189	i think you're all cylons
S0190	i think i'll go to communication
S0192	how be that possible
S0192	go to communication cool so this one allow you to look at the back of these two but we don't have any on the board
S0190	yeah so
S0192	you don't have to do that action you just move there
S0190	yeah
S0192	now which action would you like to do
S0189	could do one of your special card
S0192	yeah you could do one of your quorum card
S0190	yeah okay
S0192	and roslin can always pick up a quorum card as an action if she want to
S0189	hoard them
S0192	yeah mm can't believe we haven't jump very far
S0227	mm how far have we jump
S0190	that one
S0192	only three okay
S0192	you're give it to me oh no okay cool so
S0190	yeah
S0192	it say destroy three raiders that's these three
S0190	yeah yeah
S0192	or one heavy raider or one centurion token but we don't have any centurion tokens
S0190	no
S0192	so do you wanna destroy three of these or one of these
S0190	which be better
S0227	three raiders i should imagine
S0190	yeah
S0192	that it's close to us this have to go round that way this one come quicker so that
S0190	yeah okay
S0192	yeah nice work they're difficult to get rid of okay ah it say then you roll a die
S0190	yeah
S0192	and if two or less lose a population so if you get a one or a two we lose a population
S0190	yeah
S0192	nice we're good okay so that quorum card be discard
S0190	okay
S0192	cool crisis card
S0189	not not sure if 's a cylon
S0192	pardon
S0189	not sure 's a cylon
S0192	no
S0189	why would she've do that if she wasn't for
S0192	i know it be positive in our favour wasn't it
S0190	you'll have to guess
S0227	mm
S0192	misdirection
S0227	mm
S0192	i think you saw dad's card
S0189	no i didn't see that one
S0227	mm
S0192	oh
S0189	i only saw these little card
S0189	which be why i know i could get him in the brig or i think i could
S0227	mm
S0189	but no
S0192	erm which crises card do you choose
S0190	right i need to get rid of that big time i think will you just tell me that and i'll show it you so that i
S0192	oh it's powerful isn't it
S0190	yeah
S0192	legendary discovery if we pass this one we get one more point on this thing so we're at three and if we win this we go up to four
S0227	okay
S0192	so this add another one to our distance but it's power of fourteen
S0190	yeah
S0192	and it's purple and red
S0190	right
S0227	so we gotta get
S0190	yeah
S0192	which be pretty difficult
S0190	yes
S0192	because none of us choose character
S0190	so it's better to discard that one i think
S0192	purple or red
S0189	i can make a good contribution to that
S0192	and if we fail it
S0227	what's it purple and red
S0192	yeah if we fail it we lose a food and destroy a raptor it's purple and red can people help with that very much
S0227	fourteen
S0192	i have one crisis card
S0190	so i don't think er that's one i'll just discard then and this be the one
S0192	so you're not do that one okay
S0190	we're not gonna do that we're gonna do that
S0192	right so this one power of nine yellow and green raiders move round no jump pass no effect fail minus one morale and the current player look at one random loyalty card if you fail you get to look at a loyalty card so you if you're a cylon might want us to fail i don't know
S0227	mm
S0192	or we can just take the or here everyone discard two skill card
S0227	take a vote
S0189	right so let me have a look
S0192	so we can either vote to the power of nine yellow and green or
S0227	what colour
S0192	yellow and green
S0189	right so if someone be a cylon they'd wanna play the game and then they'd want it a low number
S0192	yeah
S0189	right

S0192	yeah you you're in sickbay
S0227	so do what do that mean
S0189	i put you in there
S0192	you can only get one skill card during your receive skill set so choose one
S0189	and i don't think you can do any action
S0192	and choose wisely
S0227	and no action
S0192	no he can
S0189	ah no
S0192	he's only in sickbay
S0189	why do i bother put him in there then
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0189	we lose a morale for that
S0192	you use a lot of stuff for that
S0227	action right erm
S0227	my action'd be could be to come out of the sickbay couldn't it
S0192	yeah well you can move and you can take an action so you still basically just stop you form collect a skill card
S0189	better than nothing
S0227	could i move back there
S0192	okay but you have to discard a skill card
S0227	oh right but if i move there
S0190	have you get any
S0227	i've get one
S0192	if you move anywhere here you're okay if you move on here
S0227	right well er i can go in the command area can't i
S0192	yeah you can activate two vipers
S0227	would that be a good idea to do that or not
S0192	we're about to jump
S0227	no be the answer to that question
S0192	so maybe not
S0189	where be you hide the bourbons
S0192	you've already eat the other pack
S0189	there be only four in there
S0192	only four
S0227	he'll go through the whole lot
S0192	he's gonna be on the toilet
S0190	he won't go through the whole lot they're the biscuits for the week
S0190	you're like your father
S0227	no he's actually worse
S0190	he can't be
S0189	i may be worse
S0192	you will you'll be on the toilet in about half an hour my stomach
S0190	yeah i be gonna say he doesn't normally i don't know the last time he eat a biscuit doesn't have anything
S0227	what's this one
S0192	that one's to put someone in the brig
S0227	what's the front one
S0192	do he not normally eat biscuits then
S0227	ah i can potentially get a erm we need to be move up don't we
S0192	what to jump
S0227	yeah
S0192	if you're a cylon you might wanna do it and and sabotage our population i personally because our population be a bite low would wait at least till we get one more so we only risk one population not three
S0227	okay what's the action to that one
S0192	shoot er a heavy raider but there aren't any
S0227	can we share
S0192	yeah
S0227	what's this one
S0192	that one's where you pick up a tactics
S0192	or this have move tactics or engineer so you can pick up a blue one or a purple one get another purple
S0227	mm
S0192	cool right draw a crisis card
S0189	do you want me to read it
S0227	mm
S0189	food shortage er this be for the president you've get the choice of er minus two food or minus one food and you have to discard two skill card and the current player lose three so you need to make that decision
S0192	two food or one food
S0189	mm how much food have we get six so that would put us in the red
S0192	yeah we don't wanna
S0190	we don't do that then do we
S0189	i dunno it could be fun to have another cylon
S0192	it's better for the cylons to have two cylons
S0227	mm
S0189	yeah
S0190	doesn't really help cos you've either get to lose two or one
S0189	but if we lose one though we'll still be in we'll not be in the red
S0227	mm
S0190	won't we
S0192	but we don't really wanna be in the red either cos it's you're close to die if you lose any of those
S0189	yeah
S0192	so there's a fine balance
S0190	yeah i think we'll do
S0192	can't remember the last time i have hot chocolate
S0227	mm
S0190	minus one food
S0192	minus one food
S0190	and then the president discard two and the player discard three
S0192	so who be the player be that you dad
S0227	that be me unfortunately
S0192	so you've gotta discard three skill card
S0190	yeah
S0227	i don't have three to discard
S0192	you have two so get rid of those two
S0227	right
S0190	and i've get to get rid of two as well
S0192	yeah
S0190	there you go and have you gotta do this bite at the bottom
S0192	yes okay so we go up one the jump track nice and raiders move around

S0190	can i have them back now please cos i'll have three yellow and two green please
S0192	three yellow two green
S0190	okay thank you
S0192	you could jump us now if you want to we're only risk one population
S0190	so what do that mean
S0227	jump
S0192	so you know we're try to to get further
S0190	yeah
S0192	you could help us to get further
S0190	right
S0192	my prematurely jump us
S0190	right
S0192	now if we wait till one more of these markers if we get one more of these
S0190	yeah
S0192	then we'll just jump on our own anyway
S0190	right
S0192	but you could take a risk and risk one population and jump early so jump now
S0190	and be that an advantage do you think
S0227	er
S0192	we're not in any danger
S0227	we're not in any danger no they're that's immobilise
S0190	right so we might as well stay where we be
S0227	yeah
S0190	so er an action
S0192	but say that there be a you do wanna get there as fast as possible because these card just keep hammer away at your things
S0227	yes at your
S0192	so you don't wanna hang around too long
S0227	no
S0192	we've already be hang around for quite a while
S0227	you wanna yes you wanna shorten the journey don't you

S0189	i swear i haven't have a hot chocolate in like

S0227	mm
S0190	right my action's gonna be this one
S0192	okay
S0190	go to draw
S0192	so you draw two skill card of any type
S0190	yeah
S0192	that can come out of your skill set that's a pretty good card

S0192	nice
S0190	thank you can i have one of those horrible things or two
S0192	yeah two of the horrible oh sorry

S0192	of the horrible crisis card who's your money on now
S0190	sorry oh
S0189	not sure possibly dad

S0192	oh excuse me sorry
S0190	fight power you put in that stuff didn't you
S0227	mm
S0227	mm
S0190	i'll discard that one
S0192	okay
S0190	and play that one
S0227	hope you don't do that when you're teach your students
S0192	no
S0189	it'd be quite interest to
S0192	just let a very quiet smelly one past as i walk past
S0227	mm
S0192	see them all like
S0192	power of eleven so regardless of this these move but kind of at the same time as they move we jump so they don't actually move
S0189	they're go
S0192	nice one very nice and now we need to vote
S0227	er but doesn't that come back on again
S0192	erm yes yeah we say that
S0227	which actually potentially make it more dangerous than it be before the chomp
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos it be immobilise
S0192	yeah it be immobilise oh interest if we pass we increase the jump by one that's good if we fail we minus a population and place one centurion marker here so that's not good don't want that to happen or we can minus a population and decrease the jump prep by one what would you like to do do you wanna vote or do you wanna do the or
S0190	what colour can we use yellow purple and blue
S0227	we can't help in any in any department
S0192	i can pull my weight definitely more than my weight
S0189	what colour
S0192	purple yellow and blue
S0189	and green
S0190	i can't help and green
S0192	there's no green
S0190	that's blue
S0189	oh be that blue
S0227	can't see
S0189	yeah it's blue i can't help
S0190	i can't hardly help either
S0227	mm
S0192	er oh
S0189	i can barely help
S0192	dad you can't help
S0227	i don't have any card
S0192	well we don't wanna minus a population and place one centurion marker at the start of the board party do we
S0227	so what's the alternative
S0192	we minus a population and decrease the jump track by one we can't decrease any more anyway
S0227	we can't decrease it so we just lose one
S0192	so we just minus a population
S0227	yeah that's the er the obvious option
S0192	so be we do that
S0227	yeah
S0190	uhu
S0227	you've get no choice really have you
S0192	decrease in population right and now we jump so dad you choose two of these
S0227	right and it's one of them isn't it
S0190	can i give you that card no cos it's not my turn be it
S0192	no it's not your turn no
S0192	should've give it to me earlier on another round and then i could've choose not then
S0190	so can i give it to you any time
S0192	as an action
S0190	yes
S0192	yeah
S0190	oh right
S0192	yeah when it's your action then you can give it to
S0190	yeah when it's mine
S0192	he study them very intensely doesn't he
S0192	interest that you're apollo
S0189	i know
S0192	his son
S0192	in the tv show 's character be the son of dad's character
S0227	of er of adama
S0190	mm
S0192	and actually you're his missus
S0190	oh
S0227	his squeeze
S0192	yeah
S0192	they're they're very close she's very unwell and he look after her and i'm just someone random
S0192	just the chief
S0227	right i'm gonna go for this option
S0192	okay
S0227	lose one fuel the admiral may risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher gain one food otherwise destroy one raptor
S0192	okay
S0227	so basically i've gotta
S0192	risk a raptor roll a die what do you have to roll
S0227	erm gotta lose one fuel have we lose that
S0192	yeah just do it
S0227	right i've gotta get three or higher otherwise we destroy
S0192	go on then
S0227	er the that raptor
S0192	roll a die
S0227	it's gotta be three or higher that'll do
S0192	yeah nice so what happen
S0227	it just say lose one fuel the admiral may risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher gain oh sorry gain one food
S0192	nice so we gain a food but now we enter the sleeper phase and we're not in the red or anything so there's definitely gonna be two cylons in the game
S0227	why be we in define the sleeper's phase
S0189	so we've reach four
S0192	so we've reach
S0192	oh what be the card you give us
S0189	it be one
S0192	where be it
S0227	it's a it's a one
S0189	oh he's definitely a cylon isn't he
S0192	he's not take us very far at all right so we enter the sleeper phase
S0227	right
S0192	cos we've get a total of four we're try to get eight
S0227	right
S0192	and we've get four so now we each get a loyalty card again don't show it to anyone it's secret okay
S0190	okay
S0192	and have a look at your card okay if you're a cylon now you can choose to play the game covertly and nobody know or you can reveal yourself when it's your turn get a super crisis card do a special ability that's on your card your reader and then go to this area if you're like me a sympathiser this be a different card you either you're er be a cylon you be not a cylon you're a sympathiser which be what i just pick up i have to reveal myself immediately and i erm you be not er you do not receive a super crisis card and may not activate the cylon fleet location so i reveal

S0192	i can give this there's a thing here that allow me to give a card to somebody i can give a loyalty card
S0227	mm
S0192	somebody could potentially have two cylon card
S0227	right

S0227	or you're a cylon sympathiser
S0192	yeah so who be i i go to this now i resurrect the resurrection ship i have to discard down to three card i've only get three anyway now when it come to vote

S0192	so you get your two crisis
S0190	card that's right
S0192	what be your special ability so once per game you can draw four of these quorum card at once
S0190	right
S0192	as your special ability skilled politician choose one to resolve and then place the rest on the bottom of the deck so you can do that once per game as your action if you want to
S0190	okay
S0192	everyone's get a special you can like launch six vipers or something
S0227	i can launch the nuke
S0192	mm there's not much attack us at the minute
S0227	no
S0190	these be awful
S0192	we may not get to the end of this game we're only halfway
S0227	no i don't think so what time be it now
S0192	i tell you it take quite a while to play it out doesn't it
S0227	mm we'll go to a quarter past ten and then we'll
S0192	yeah
S0227	call it a draw
S0192	well if anyone be a cylon i suggest you reveal
S0227	mm
S0192	so that we can er
S0227	well before quarter past ten yeah
S0192	well like soon so that we can try and damage them a bite before quarter past ten
S0190	well i can't do that one because it there's no that's not available so it'll have to be that one i'll have to play that cos i can't do that one
S0192	you can do that one
S0190	how can you there's nothing on the board
S0192	it add it that add stuff to the board so
S0190	oh right
S0192	you probably don't wanna do that one
S0227	if you be a cylon you'd want you'd wanna play that if you be cylon cylon
S0192	if you be a cylon you'd wanna do that yeah be you a cylon would you wanna do this
S0190	i'm not tell you what i be but i'm not gonna play that one i'd rather play that one
S0192	okay
S0227	right
S0192	so yeah if you be a cylon you wanna add stuff to the board
S0227	mm ordnance
S0192	okay so we need a ten purple red blue
S0227	er no card
S0192	no effect this one release this and we go up one on the jump cool you vote
S0189	yeah
S0190	what colour purple
S0192	purple red and blue
S0189	purple red and blue i can't really help a little bite
S0227	i cannot help
S0190	i can help a little bite but not a lot
S0192	okay so be that everyone i'll lay mine down i can only put one cos i'm a cylon still need to shuffle a little bite because we don't know who there's still one more minus two minus four minus one zero one minus one three
S0190	so we fail
S0192	yeah fail minus one population er would you do that
S0189	yeah
S0192	and two of these vipers get damage so they can't be use until they get repair and i'm the only one that can repair em so
S0227	mm which you're not gonna do be you
S0192	no okay that be your go
S0190	yep
S0192	my go so i don't collect the crisis card like everyone else i just get two random and probably purple and red be probably the best ones and i can do something you may not activate the cylon fleet location so i can't do that but i can draw two crisis card and choose one to resolve mm definitely that one so when a cylon choose a crisis card these don't happen we don't do the jump
S0227	mm
S0192	we don't do the thing this one be the admiral choose minus two food sorry president choose minus two food or minus one food and you discard two skill card and i discard three
S0227	have you get three to discard
S0190	yeah he have
S0227	well i know which one i'd you can't phone a friend in this game
S0192	no
S0190	hello
S0227	tell em we're busy er jump to hyperspace
S0190	yes thank you and you that's good have you get your two visitors
S0189	be it my go
S0192	yeah it be your go
S0189	i'm a cylon
S0192	right be he reveal
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	i know it all
S0227	all along that you be
S0192	he couldn't've be before
S0227	no
S0189	no
S0192	right so you reveal
S0189	yep
S0192	so you get rid of your skill card let me have a quick check there's no reveal
S0227	so what that think about me be one be a load of rubbish wasn't it
S0189	you could still be one
S0190	mm
S0192	no he can't any more there's the two of us now
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	so nobody be one at the begin
S0227	no
S0190	no
S0192	no no one be a cylon
S0189	but who be sabotage us then
S0227	well i don't know it wasn't me
S0190	me
S0227	especially i put two card in and there be like hundreds of em
S0189	yeah
S0227	unless i'm so good at er sleight of sleight of hand
S0192	didn't really understand what happen
S0189	be you always a sympathiser
S0192	no no i've just recently get the sympathiser card
S0189	so who start as a cylon
S0190	so
S0192	you only get the sympathiser card halfway through nobody no one be a cylon
S0227	either or well er
S0189	how do you know that
S0192	because you there i only put one cylon card in
S0227	yes
S0192	for a four player game
S0227	actually we
S0192	for a five player game you put in two
S0227	and i weren't actually make any accusations it be you two who be
S0227	be everyone be
S0190	well i know wasn't cos he have to show me his card
S0227	yes you know that but i didn't know that but i never accuse anyone of be one
S0189	i be pretty sure you be dad
S0227	i know but i didn't defend or er i didn't deny or
S0189	you be quite sure he be as well
S0192	yeah i think er dad be
S0227	i didn't say a i didn't say a word either way
S0192	no but but that
S0227	but i didn't make any accusation either to try and erm put you know misdirect you
S0192	that make it seem suspicious that you weren't do anything so
S0227	yes yes
S0189	mm
S0192	yeah so we both become cylons in the second round
S0227	thing be in in another game of this you wouldn't know which one i be because like you say i have give no impression either way
S0192	somebody be put the wrong card in at some point
S0227	yes
S0192	i think i make a mistake once but
S0227	mm
S0192	it be definitely like two or three time when that happen
S0189	right so what
S0192	right so you discard down to three skill card
S0189	yep
S0192	then you lose your title so if you have the presidency or the admiralty you lose that so
S0227	mm
S0192	you don't you resurrect so apollo be a cylon
S0227	mm
S0192	on the resurrection ship you receive a super crisis card okay super crisis card use it wisely erm and you end your turn
S0192	or you do short ones that be not as damage
S0227	yeah
S0192	like the three be like destroy three fuel or something
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's not particularly
S0227	erm
S0192	but they've definitely get three more jump even if they get a three they still need one more to make a four and then you always have to do one more jump after you make eight so they've definitely get three more jump
S0227	mm what do it mean by that one
S0192	so you can hold this card back and you know when we do a skill check and you have to vote
S0192	and every one bid different amount at the end of it you can go oh we didn't make it by two and then add this card and we make it
S0227	right
S0192	cos it reduce the the difficulty by two
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	but you use it after this you wait and see
S0227	yes it's post rather than
S0192	yeah
S0227	there you go
S0192	but you guy be gonna find it hard now to vote because there's only two of you to
S0227	yes
S0192	beat the skill check
S0227	yes
S0192	and there's two of us to put in against you you really didn't want two cylon's against you it's much much harder
S0227	no no no
S0227	especially when you're you're you you've play it before
S0190	you've play and we haven't
S0227	yeah
S0192	be you comfy there
S0189	i be

S0189	there be a chair there
S0192	yeah there be it's quite far away i'm use to sit on the floor we always play this game on the floor so
S0227	you've play this a few time
S0192	yeah we've probably play it like ten time
S0227	yeah so you're quite good at this i'm fumble around in the dark
S0192	mm
S0189	that's like thirty hours
S0192	yeah
S0189	you've play it for quite a while
S0192	we've play game of throne even more
S0227	weapons control

S0227	how many roll have i get
S0192	only one
S0227	so i'm only gonna damage it with
S0192	yeah you've gotta shoot it with the base with the battlestar
S0227	oh well might as well try that
S0192	five to eight nice

S0190	think you might
S0192	there you be and i'm gonna roll if we get a five or higher where's the die
S0227	mm sixty percent chance
S0192	oh
S0190	good
S0227	right
S0192	so no damage
S0192	your move
S0190	mm
S0190	what's your what's you play bro oh i didn't get my two i should pick up two of these when i start my round do you wanna get two which colour
S0189	erm red and purple
S0227	yeah you don't get a crisis card then do you
S0192	no
S0227	doesn't get a crisis card do he
S0192	no
S0189	no but i do have this
S0227	which be probably bad news
S0189	big gun
S0192	oh nice so use his super crisis card
S0227	yeah what so it's gonna be bad news
S0192	right so let's see what happen first thing that happen be activate heavy raider so that's one away from go in and also basestar attack but there's no basestar so you be lucky you have two here
S0227	oh right okay
S0192	er you you destroy them erm now we activate and we bring in two basestars so although you get rid of them they're back we bring in another heavy raider we bring in four raiders here
S0227	we need to jump
S0192	yeah you do you bring in two raptors and two civilian ship four civilian ship
S0189	
S0192	two in each quadrant
S0227	it doesn't put the jump it doesn't put the jump
S0192	and also yeah it say and reduce the jump track by two
S0227	well we're we're
S0190	we're absolutely stuff
S0227	we're screw
S0190	how on earth do you manage to pick that up
S0192	that's the most powerful card in the game basically
S0227	
S0192	that be lucky you get that card
S0227	er be it oh be that the one most powerful er er
S0192	yeah that be the most
S0227	that's er we we hit with the worst possible card in the game
S0190	er
S0192	so it only get better from here on in
S0227	mm
S0190	you mean it can
S0227	right so it's now my go again
S0190	mm
S0189	yeah nice
S0192	can actually when you play the game when you become a cylon can be kinda quick because you just quickly do your move and then they have to think about what they're do for quite a while so you kind of end up just
S0227	i've gotta use my other nuke and try and
S0192	quickly just do your good move
S0227	i've gotta use a nuke on er this one's actually more dangerous isn't it than that one
S0192	yeah i'd say so
S0227	er yes cos it's get er a heavy raptor and it's further round here
S0192	and it's also get this here
S0227	and it's get that in there so we're gonna go for blast that
S0192	right do you have something to help with the die roll
S0227	erm
S0190	what colour be that
S0227	add play before add two to the result
S0192	cool so
S0227	right
S0192	take a roll
S0227	and what do i need
S0192	you look please with yourself
S0189	it be a good move
S0192	yeah
S0227	a six give me eight
S0192	you get eight you can it so you destroy this and these
S0227	how about the heavy raptor
S0192	no you don't destroy them i'm afraid
S0227	right well that be a reasonable result
S0192	mm
S0227	and i've gotta pick up some card
S0192	so your nuke's go
S0189	dad use his nuke well
S0227	er erm i need another
S0190	mm
S0189	what he's take out a basestar
S0192	yeah he's take out a basestar and two raptors
S0190	what do you need
S0227	another one of those
S0190	mm
S0192	two raiders as well but they've still get the heavy raiders here
S0189	mm
S0227	and i've gotta pick up a catastrophe card haven't i
S0190	yeah
S0192	crisis card
S0227	yeah
S0227	same difference isn't it
S0192	right basestar attack be the first thing that happen so that's useful
S0227	it say fulfiller of prophecy the spell the scroll tell us that a die leader with lend lead us to salvation porter erm pass the current player draw one politics skill card fail one population or the current player discard one skill card after the activate cylon ship step return to the resolve crisis deck draw a new crisis card
S0192	let's have a look so the first thing the basestar attack so do you wanna roll a die see
S0227	right er what do i need
S0192	you the basestar's gonna attack
S0227	what be i attack
S0192	the battlestar so

S0192	no
S0227	unfortunately that's a seven not a one
S0192	so choose one and what's damage so oh no
S0227	er don't tell me the whole thing's wipe out be it
S0192	that's just fuel so you've just lose a fuel
S0227	oh right be be that good or bad for me
S0192	well bad you lose a fuel right now you've gotta vote for six do you wanna do the or or do you just wanna vote
S0227	which be
S0192	the or be you discard a skill card and then you draw a new crisis card and resolve it
S0227	no
S0192	or you vote for six yellow and green if you pass you draw one politics skill card if you fail you lose a population
S0227	and there's two of those card go in don't they

S0192	er you can get the game of throne one for about thirty pound
S0189	that's not cheap
S0192	i mean if you think people spend fifty quid on an xbox game then i mean
S0192	thirty quid for a board game that last forever i think this be worth thirty pound
S0189	till people look back and say game of throne what be that
S0192	yeah
S0189	remember
S0190	it'll be worth money then
S0192	yeah may well be

S0192	everything back in the bag do you like it at all
S0189	it be cool

S0192	you get it
S0190	with a bite of help i do
S0189	the be when no one know who the cylons be
S0192	no yeah
S0189	once we reveal it be not as fun
S0192	no gotta be careful when you reveal
S0189	mm
S0192	it's harder to be a human i think than a cylon but yeah at the begin i be convince it be one of these two
S0189	like once you become a cylon you can't really do much
S0192	no
S0189	you just have to like keep take card and keep play them
S0192	yeah they've er they've fix it apparently there's some flaw to the game and with the expansion pack they've change some of the game in one of the new ones you can flush someone out of an airlock and kill their character so they have to choose another character
S0192	there's a bunch of different things that you can surely once you get another three board go
S0192	insane
