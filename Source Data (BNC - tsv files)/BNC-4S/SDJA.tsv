S0328	what now you're drink this wine
S0326	what do you mean
S0328	we'll
S0326	i we're share both of them
S0383	i enquire with my french friend last night who also get strike by lightning the other day
S0330	what
S0383	well his house get strike by lightning
S0383	and he think he wake up and think that he'd be attack by giant rat
S0330	what
S0383	cos everything have like fall off the wall
S0383	and he
S0330	he be like ah it's something doesn't mean
S0383	and he live by like erm pond
S0383	so it's like pond come in and like
S0328	pond rat
S0330	ah no
S0328	definitely pond rat
S0383	and then he find out there's a lightning strike and all like the his electrical stuff have pop out of the wall like all the sockets
S0330	that's crazy wow
S0326	yeah my my aunt get electrocute by be on the phone when her house get strike by lightning
S0383	do she actually get electrocute
S0326	get electrocute
S0328	what she die
S0383	what's happen to her
S0326	no she's erm she survive but she get like cancer like a year later and i think it's from that
S0328	oh
S0383	cos i watch this documentary once about people who get strike by lightning and it's always there's this like one guy and he would sleep for like eighty four hours or something and then just stay awake for like three months and he'd just do these weird like he'd just change his like cycle
S0330	that's weird
S0383	so yeah he'd like sleep for like three days and not three months but then like stay awake for like a week and a half and the i can't remember like but they do like all the crazy shit like rewire people brain and stuff
S0328	i meet someone who'd be and he be well crazy
S0326	and your chance like as soon as you get hit by it once that's what lightning know you or something the chance like go down like one thousand percent or something
S0383	probably like look round go
S0328	or they will
S0326	they will they're like they're like likely it happen once it's likely to happen again basically
S0330	yeah cos my friend's mum be like she's a bite crazy anyway and she be walk around a reservoir and she get hit by lightning and then apparently get hit by lightning again like five minutes later or something
S0326	what
S0330	cos that could have like happen
S0330	charge right
S0328	charge yeah
S0383	yeah
S0328	well yeah this guy be fuck
S0330	be a bite crazy but she probably just actually get hit by lightning
S0383	you also get people that try and get hit by it as well
S0328	really like
S0383	there's gotta be like
S0328	chasers
S0383	go out with like wear like tin foil and hold like a big metal pole
S0326	all you've gotta do be go out
S0328	you die
S0326	all you've gotta do be go out in a boat in the ocean and on top of the masts
S0383	say what
S0326	if you go on a boat in the ocean and you go to the top of er the boat there's nowhere else for lightning to go to so you'd definitely get hit
S0383	yeah true
S0330	but doesn't it just really hurt
S0328	yeah i bet it really hurt
S0326	yeah but you get superpowers
S0328	yeah you couldn't get
S0383	yeah you do get superpowers
S0328	invisible
S0330	get superpowers
S0383	i'd go through a little pain for a superpower definitely
S0328	be more angle
S0330	er i get literally sort of once sort of and it be really really like a tiny weeny one i'm guess and it really really hurt
S0326	i
S0328	i get electrocute
S0326	when when i be in well like a couple of years ago use to go out we always go swim at in the lido at night but you know they've get electric fence around the top of it
S0330	yeah
S0326	we be like we always like we'd get out of the pool soak wet and get electrocute by the thing and we'd all like fall off the wall and on their back
S0326	but everybody be still sort of waste and no one never really notice
S0383	we use to do that all the time when we be grow up like electric fence and
S0383	where you like grab it and grab onto someone and then they get electrocute
S0330	what
S0383	pass it have you never do that you know like in the countryside
S0330	countryside
S0383	yeah
S0330	that's hardcore shit
S0383	no but it's like but it's not an actual electric shock like you can hold
S0326	yeah
S0383	it just like bolt you
S0326	yeah
S0383	it's really weird
S0326	i be always i be afraid of them as a child cos i think if you throw something at then the electricity would get you
S0326	so i use to have i once be in a house where you could see the electric fence from under the doorway so i would like throw a stick at it and hide
S0383	you can't see me
S0326	to see what would happen i think get electrocute
S0383	yeah we use to do that all the time but like you make like line of people and then one person grab it and pass it all the way through just get
S0328	do the first person get it more
S0383	no you don't get it cos it pass through you the only the end person get it
S0328	that's
S0326	another thing when we be climb over everyone's sort of like hold onto each other

S0330	get some bollinger don't just spend money on wine how much be scratch card they're like really expensive aren't they
S0383	always
S0326	it just depend
S0383	nah one pound
S0326	can get a ten pound one
S0383	yeah ten pound
S0328	yeah but
S0330	i'm sure i've be behind people in queue in the shop and they spend like thirty quid on scratch card just like that
S0383	yeah you can the expensive ones i always go for the one pound option i don't think i even a two pound scratch card
S0326	give me a scratch card for valentine's day
S0383	i just always give them to people on birthdays cos like they're easy to get
S0328	for valentine's day
S0383	wait do you give if you give someone a scratch card what term and condition do you like if do you get fifty percent if they win
S0328	fifty pound if it be anything like significant
S0328	get back
S0383	i wonder what the law be with that like if you give someone a scratch card but you buy it legally you would keep the winnings
S0328	i don't think the law apply you'd have to figure it out between you
S0328	fist fight
S0383	there's gotta be a law for that
S0326	arm wrestle for it
S0383	there need to be a law for anything
S0330	remind me afterwards
S0328	yeah it's gotta be it's gotta be at least like strong moral code in place
S0383	yeah i reckon arm wrestle
S0328	but i think they're always like you have to state the as the condition when you give them the scratch card you have to be like if you win i'm get half can't be like yeah actually i be gonna say we should split that erm
S0383	but only if it's above a certain amount surely
S0330	what do say when she you a scratch card
S0328	nothing
S0383	happy valentine's
S0330	that's that's that that's real love that be
S0383	what's yours be mine

S0328	he's a nanny
S0383	and we be produce a photoshoot
S0330	but what do you do like what's your normal like what's your job title in the life
S0383	like at the moment like production manager
S0330	okay right oh
S0383	so for like
S0330	so you make so you make shit happen
S0383	i'm not very good at make it happen but yeah
S0330	that's your job
S0383	yeah
S0330	okay cool
S0383	have to like find stupid shit people be like i wanna shoot in a castle that's get like da da da
S0330	yeah
S0383	and i like okay cool here's like twenty castle
S0330	yeah
S0383	and ah
S0330	the people that be like load of people have ideas you can always like people who actually do it be the people actually do things right
S0383	well it's quite strange yeah but it's quite frustrate when you're just facilitate other people's terrible ideas
S0330	yeah
S0383	you know i'm just like fine why don't i just
S0330	yeah shit
S0383	make my own idea happen
S0330	yeah
S0383	it's really depress but the reason i'm learn how to do it
S0330	yeah
S0383	not that there's any magic like this be like i know it sound stupid but it's like i always be just like how do like this shit happen like how do they do that and it's just like you literally just you know and someone's like yeah i want a badger you literally like google badger farm and phone those people up
S0330	yeah of course
S0383	i know it sound really obvious but i never like
S0326	can you imagine imagine have to do that stuff before the internet
S0330	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0383	i always think that i'm just like how the fuck do that happen
S0328	and people didn't do such they didn't do such interest things like they in a studio or
S0330	well also it's like try to it's i mean you you you can you experience that if you try and do something in india cos like the internet doesn't really exist properly
S0383	yeah but also the i be speak to someone about this today
S0330	yeah
S0383	it's like the way shit do happen be way more like common sense like i remember when i be do shit in morocco when we like want something there you'd just like go up to someone and ask them
S0330	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0383	or like in india it's like hey i want a palm tree so like i i call up this guy and i be like hey we need a palm tree for this photoshoot and he turn up with a rickshaw drive me round it be like point at which tree you want and i'll dig it up
S0330	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0383	and it's like i need a motorbike and they just go up to him and be like can i borrow your motorbike here's it's like you have to call a fuck motorbike fix agent and sign the fuck form and
S0330	yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a weird like it's a weird sort of er like double like parallel thing where in one civilisation that's like really like it in some ways in the uk it's really easy to do like all sort of stuff and in some ways it's really really difficult and
S0328	make it more over complicate
S0330	yeah whereas whereas
S0383	but we've turn it into the industry and you have to pull all those things in position
S0330	of course if someone can make money
S0383	so people have a job
S0330	at any point and and also pay tax than like at any level
S0328	and like regulations and shit
S0330	yeah exactly it become really complicate
S0383	yeah
S0330	you
S0383	but it also it's just ridiculous because it's like people just cos they have the ability to ask for stuff just ask for things and that's what's really strange about my job be like you can't just be like do you actually want that and like have you actually sit there i be like be like this be what i want to create it's like let's get like a chess set and a badger and like let's shoot like maybe up a hill and oh i'm just like just take five more minutes and like make a decision rather than just exercise a right to like make someone fuck work for you
S0330	but why do they do that just cos they're really rich and
S0383	cos they fuck can and they're get pay in
S0330	yeah
S0383	another thing i really work out which i always like walk around here be like how the fuck be these people drink lattes all day like what the fuck do they do how be they buy like t shirt for like two hundred pound and like do this and like oh shit people actually get pay like people get pay ridiculous amount of money
S0330	yeah
S0383	like
S0330	also lattes cost er one percent over
S0383	yeah
S0330	so like there'll be lot of people
S0383	no but you know what i mean you go into like
S0330	no of course but there be lot of people like who who who can look as if they're really money but actually really aren't
S0383	yeah true
S0330	you know what i mean and i think be massively like the huge spectrum and it's very difficult to tell the difference between somebody who's really really poor and someone who's actually make load of money which be kind of weird
S0383	yeah no it be
S0330	you know it's kind of it like there's a weird like they're because it's kind of because it's because you be in a situation where it's cool to have like your boot be scuff or whatever you know there aren't those normal
S0383	there aren't like at risk signifiers
S0330	indicators yeah
S0383	yeah
S0330	and and and the people who drink lattes be also drink lattes with the people who be unemployed like they're work like they're in the same cafés you know and that's kind of weird
S0328	they should have they should have separate cafés for poor people cos
S0330	i really think they should have separate yeah
S0330	i don't wanna be
S0383	i don't think they should let poor people drink lattes
S0328	the amount of i've have to stop go to cos i've find out the poor people also be in there
S0328	it need to be more clear who be who
S0328	so i can
S0330	you just what you're do
S0383	but yeah it be gross how much some of but like also the imbalance in it like we be do this photoshoot the other day
S0383	and the makeup artist be get pay ten and a half grand
S0328	that's so crazy
S0383	to do makeup for one day and her assistant
S0330	what
S0383	and her assistant get pay two hundred pound i'm like
S0328	be both which one be that
S0383	whatever
S0328	erm what and why do you think that be because the make cos the makeup be like really good
S0383	cos they have to install like the hierarchy
S0328	it be amaze
S0383	honestly she it's just like play thing
S0330	she do a what sorry
S0328	look exactly like george clooney
S0328	it's incredible
S0328	it's cheaper than get george clooney in though
S0330	yeah that's true
S0326	what be that
S0383	we have this like boy model look like george clooney
S0383	ten and a half grand it's cheaper than get george
S0326	okay
S0383	it's gross though man honestly like the money some people get pay fuck all
S0326	i know it's like i know this makeup designer who like have a crush on me i be try to get him let him do let me be his assistant in the summer cos it's like three hundred quid a day it's like all you have to do be carry my makeup bag
S0383	oh fuck
S0330	what happen do you turn them down
S0326	no i just wasn't that you know i be try to get to let me be his makeup assistant
S0330	oh yeah
S0326	i mean i probably could have do it if i'd email him more often couldn't really i didn't really wanna do it
S0330	put the hours in
S0328	why don't you do it this holiday
S0326	i need to see him again
S0383	who

S0330	yeah it be a bite like
S0383	yeah pretty much
S0330	yeah it'll be a bite awkward if you have to like kind of do that other stuff to get the job that's a bite weird
S0383	and how do you get those
S0330	that's a bite weird
S0328	he want to blow me off and then can have the job
S0330	yeah that's what i mean it's just like

S0330	but you don't wanna like woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo
S0328	so he do wanna do it
S0330	ah sorry sorry i get i get the i get the wrong end of the stick

S0383	but honestly like do like fashion shoot like ads or whatever it be literally just like a massive hangout like no one really do anything you take like
S0330	it's so annoy
S0383	it's really really bore
S0328	people sit around and then they have like a massive lunch
S0383	yeah they just have like
S0328	sit around
S0383	a big lunch and then like everyone that's work for them be just like they're pay friends cos actually the people that be like there they're like really sad and they've just like pay people to like hang around them that be their assistants
