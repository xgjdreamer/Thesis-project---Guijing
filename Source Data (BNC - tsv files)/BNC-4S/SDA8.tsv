S0328	you know it be like fuck like say like lol this colour
S0328	i'm like oh man i really need them to not know i'm a dick it's so hard

S0330	bust
S0383	i do that all the time
S0330	there be
S0383	like i delete like i forward people email at work and then delete the thread of like what i've be talk to the other person like but then if that person reply it bring up the thread again
S0328	yeah
S0383	it's like fuck i'm very unprofessional basically
S0328	yeah
S0383	i can't be fuck man people be like
S0330	at the end of
S0328	normally it doesn't on mine i'm not normally like
S0383	my work
S0383	they're so prissy about like
S0328	and like i try not to be an idiot
S0383	the way you converse on the email
S0330	really
S0383	yeah
S0330	in what way
S0383	like everything have to be spell right
S0330	oh what
S0383	i know fuck hate it
S0330	spell
S0383	the spell have to be right
S0330	that's bullshit because not everybody who just some job be good at spell but you know what i mean
S0326	they like er er today
S0383	dude i'm fuck terrible at it
S0328	and he call the er soup urns like soup urns like e a r n s it's really cute and he's like super like get lolzy dyslexia
S0383	dude i'm dyslexic as fuck
S0330	load of people be dyslexic
S0383	like it take me so long to write an email at work like i have to like write it out in microsoft word
S0330	yeah
S0383	spell check and then copy and paste it
S0328	oh man that's fuck
S0330	but it's really weird cos like i feel like ever since i i enter the world the world of the world of work i have encounter lot and lot of people especially in cook who be who be dyslexic like from with vary degrees er but then i think back to my sort of schooldays you know which be like grammar school or whatever and no like basically no one be dyslexic and it's obvious that it's not that all the you know intelligent people from that area all the intelligent girls from that area erm weren't dyslexic it's just that all the test to get into that like school be be exclusive and and didn't let
S0328	mm
S0330	dyslexic people in basically and it's er really crazy because like er like like two of the people who have be most successful in in the kitchen with me one of them be er like severely dyslexic and the other be like mildly dyslexic but in in in in my sort of school career they would never have make like they would never have get anywhere
S0328	probably wouldn't be allow in
S0330	it's so crazy yeah it's really really crazy and i've suddenly like just just just like it's only just click in the kind of my own work that i do and it must be really weird cos even for them within this like context of like non you know it's like you know it's cook it's like you you don't write down that much stuff for most of it like it's super super practical but even within this context you still have to write shit down and you know there's still like all sort of obstacles and that it's really weird like it's really crazy
S0328	i really think it's strange to be hang up on spell
S0330	yeah because i'm just like well of course i understand what i mean and also
S0328	yeah
S0330	and also i realise that i have like a massive erm or at least i do have have a certain amount of er prejudice towards people who be like not that good with word like erm and i'm not that good with word but i remember when i first meet er one of the chefs who work for me and he like always like mix his word up and it's just cos he's really dyslexic and i think like when i first meet him i think he be a bite stupid but he's like really not at all
S0326	he's like einstein then
S0330	it's really weird like he's super bright but like there's something about him where he's just like on on first meet you just like you like you don't think i dunno it's really it's so weird how you how you make quick judgements about people and on certain
S0383	it be weird as well like
S0330	certain things
S0383	how people like attack people that like go on like on twitter and shit and they're like that she's like
S0326	they do their asterisk
S0383	didn't spell it properly
S0326	or they
S0330	yeah
S0326	they do
S0383	it's like you know
S0326	you know the classic
S0383	still make like a really valid point
S0330	yeah yeah exactly
S0326	and the the classic thing be the asterisk and like you're with the apostrophe
S0330	yeah
S0326	you know
S0330	but i think
S0383	but i don't know any of that shit i'm so bad at that shit
S0330	but i think a huge part of it be i mean first of all it's to do with dyslexia and and and the sort of abilities in relation to certain skills but also a lot of er i mean a huge part of it which i think be where the prejudice come from be erm education and class
S0383	yeah totally a class thing
S0330	like on that like like i i like it's yeah and like grammar be specifically like you know i go to a grammar school weirdly ironically where grammar like actual english language grammar wasn't a big thing like it didn't it didn't like it wasn't a huge aspect of er of our education whereas all the like fee pay school like it be a huge part of the education like all
S0328	mm
S0330	all of my friends who be
S0326	grammar school be a name though
S0330	pardon
S0326	just like a name
S0330	grammar school
S0326	yeah
S0330	no no i know i know but i but ironically like it doesn't really
S0326	yeah yeah
S0330	it it's not it's not specific like it's just a weird thing but like all my friends who go to a fee pay school like their it their sort of english language skills and and specifically grammar be be much much better because it's a it's a it's a label of of of class
S0328	yeah
S0330	whereas
S0383	yeah totally
S0330	whereas for me
S0383	no i have to do like interview for people to get into university the other day like cos i'm like lecture at the moment
S0330	uhu
S0383	and it be shock cos we it be the day that we have to interview people from er they have a relationship with colleges in like underprivileged areas
S0328	mm
S0383	and they have to let a percentage of
S0330	access
S0383	the students in yeah like access shit and just these people like they have no ability to or confidence really it come like massively down to like confidence they have no ability to communicate like properly
S0330	yeah
S0383	but like look at their work it be fuck amaze
S0330	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0383	and then there's these other kid that come in and because they be like teach like this be how you communicate and
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0383	this be how you converse and like build that self confidence
S0330	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0383	they'd stand in front of us and like but and like yeah of course you're go to but like their work be terrible
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0383	and it's like it's definitely like cos i always like say this with cos she like be like not from a certain class but she grow up in
S0330	uhu
S0383	and she's just get this confidence
S0330	mm
S0383	about her
S0330	yeah
S0383	that like she can just come across she's get this confidence
S0330	yeah
S0383	and self belief
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0383	that like people from other areas of or like areas of the country
S0330	yeah
S0383	don't have
S0330	that's where you're get like
S0383	and she's cos she's like
S0330	that's what you get in a public school that sort of
S0383	yeah
S0330	stuff that that's the main aspect
S0326	and the entitlement until they
S0330	that's
S0326	get to like
S0330	yeah
S0383	yeah
S0330	that's and the
S0383	no it totally be
S0330	but the
S0383	it's like
S0330	and they're two and the same thing like they're two and the same thing you know
S0383	but it's the entitlement and like that be like yeah you can do shit and it's gonna happen

S0383	and i be at my
S0328	yeah
S0383	cos i never really consider education as like view as er different type of education you can have and i be help her look for school for her kid and she be like i don't know if i want him to have this type of education or this type of education or this type of education and he come home the other day and they have fancy dress day and he's like six and he have a list of like what they could dress up as and it be like doctor and they have point it's like doctor like you know earn lot of money care about help people
S0330	woah
S0383	at six years old you're like teach like to think in that way
S0330	that's crazy
S0383	it's nut
S0326	i didn't get into a grammar school fail the test
S0328	mm
S0330	really
S0383	how's that dumb
S0328	dumb fuck
S0383	dumb fuck i'm really
S0326	then i reapplied to the same school for sixth form and then i get in but i didn't wanna go
S0330	yeah fair enough man but it's like it's such a weird thing because like in i dunno
S0326	it's not actually it's not even just it's it's not it's like this cos when i think of the school i go to it be a really good because they actually that kind in confidence in the kid
S0330	yeah
S0326	to do like you know be like not gonna go further in education gcse
S0328	yeah
S0326	they instill with sort of like have big ambition and be confident enough to go after them
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0326	they weren't just like tell they be stupid the whole time they be just sort of like
S0330	yeah
S0326	sort of push to the things they be good at
S0330	yeah
S0383	no i like so i've interview like kid to get into like to get up to this fashion course and i i really believe there's like there's such like what's the word doesn't mean have like bad vocabulary but there's like so like if you're like slightly creative people like you've get to do that
S0328	mm mm
S0383	you know like you're put if you're like kind of good at science people be like you've get to be a scientist
S0330	yeah
S0383	but like creative there's like
S0330	which be bullshit
S0383	such a value place on it and all these kid would turn up i be like who the fuck sort of like they'd like turn up and they're like i'm like why do you wanna do and they're just like cos i like clothe and people have always tell me i look like i like i be like go and buy some clothe then but don't try and make it a career
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0383	cos you obviously have no talent in this and like it's not for me to say and like yeah they could probably go to university and meet these people and like have some fuck epiphany and
S0330	mm
S0383	just be in that like environment like come up with something
S0330	yeah
S0383	but like
S0326	so that i do it professionally
S0383	it's people
S0326	do you know when you're seventeen you're obviously not go to
S0383	yeah it's just i dunno and it's just
S0330	yeah
S0383	i i just think there's like
S0330	but also like they
S0383	misplace like
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0383	importance place on it
S0330	i agree it think there's too much emphasis on like so what be you interest in and it's like well to be honest at sixteen i be interest in like take load of drug and get fuck up and listen to like really weird music and put myself in really uncomfortable situations do i wanna make a career out of that no of course i fuck don't you know what mean
S0383	yeah i think it's really irresponsible
S0330	and and but but like but like all of those aspects would potentially be good in in a in a billion different other career alongside like some other or whatever or or er no like it's er cos a very very complex thing and i think you're right that that that people be like oh so you're interest in clothe you should be in fashion whereas actually that person who's interest in clothe might actually just be really good with people and be quite sort of visual and be like and and could therefore apply that that those skills and so like a fuck billion different job man it's like
S0383	yeah exactly
S0330	it's so stupid
S0383	or to an industry that we actually have and people can make as much money as they
S0330	yeah yeah exactly
S0330	exactly yeah
S0383	you know like we don't have a fuck
S0326	but i always think they i know it's but they should teach things in school like learn to drive and like stuff you can use
S0330	yeah
S0326	so it shouldn't just be like what be you gonna be
S0330	yeah yeah there's this whole and like
S0383	but i don't i
S0326	and teach you how to be a function person
S0330	yeah yeah yeah exactly it's like
S0383	but the issue i think be be like
S0330	there's this all there's all this emphasis on on on on on on on this this like sole career be your identity and that's what you be whereas actually especially as a woman i i i know i know it's different for men as well but but but historically as a woman you be a mother like maybe or not but you're also like a huge part of your identity like you know you're a mother a sister a er a a like a daughter and all these other aspects or like a you know i be part of this and i'm part of that and i do this and i do that but i also do this for work and like these like super plural understand of identity and i think like education be very very very much about like i'm gonna be a doctor or i'm gonna be a teacher and that's not that's not like that's not real life that's not
S0326	yeah
S0330	people don't just do one thing that's fuck
S0383	yeah
S0330	bullshit like no one like very few people do just one thing or they do one thing for a bite and then they do another thing for a bite and so how do that idea of you you be able to do more than one thing be a really like that's not how it's teach at all
S0383	no
S0330	be it
S0383	no it be i felt really like disgust by the whole process
S0330	i bet yeah it's
S0383	and it be but also it be like what be really like the it be like so this like rude boy turn up and he be like he want to look out on the sportswear course and he be like he actually have like he be really like what he be do but then it be like he be go through the like he be like here's my contextual research and here's my like rubbings of like fuck tree a bite on the side it doesn't matter like you don't have to like go through that
S0330	mm
S0383	to be like that's not gonna like validate this thing you have here and
S0326	also but some people be aware of like the whole thing and know that they're just they do this and put this act on
S0330	yeah it's just
S0326	to do for the
S0330	a hoop thing
S0326	for the
S0330	yeah people definitely get that
S0383	yeah
S0330	especially people who then go on to be successful like the like the middle class understand that you have to jump through hoop you have to jump through hoop your whole like your whole career until you graduate
S0328	especially if you
S0330	yeah until you graduate
S0383	but i also think
S0330	and after
S0328	huh
S0326	let me take it
S0328	tea
S0330	but so so so i think at that level of you're a rude boy and you recognise that you have to jump through hoop that's just the same as like you know like a an english literature student jump through hoop who's
S0383	mm
S0330	actually gonna turn out to be like a fuck corporate director or like
S0383	yeah
S0330	more like a manager of sainsbury's or something you know i mean
S0383	yeah but i don't i dunno oh it be a really complicate day in my life
S0330	yeah
S0330	but i also think that like
S0328	always
S0330	there's something really horrible and weird and shit about like young people tick box but also just like people do shit even if it's like if it doesn't mean anything like as least if they if they have a purpose and a goal and and they're like okay i'm gonna do that and then i'm gonna do that and then i'm gonna do that and then i'm gonna do that and then maybe i'll everything'll be cool or like
S0328	mm
S0330	you know along the way everything will be kind of cool or maybe it won't be cool i have no idea
S0330	but you know like do shit be awesome
S0328	yeah
S0330	and and i feel like at so many level especially if they're disadvantage there be so many situations where you could just be like wow fuck it
S0383	yeah but also a massive thing
S0330	i'll just go i'll just go on the dole and watch the youtube videos
S0330	cos you could be happy do that and then it's like well fuck man you may as well just die now
S0383	great but also i think like massively i be speak to my friend the other day about this
S0328	mm
S0383	like when i
S0383	when i be like
S0383	but when i like
S0383	because of the class background i come from it be like creativity or like blah blah be see as like an escape cos it be see as an alternative to like the lifestyle or
S0330	right yeah yeah
S0383	the life that we live in so it be like you know it be like if you be like kind of interest in film everyone be like go and be a director or if you're like you're kind of interest in clothe people be like go and be a fashion designer like there be
S0328	yeah
S0383	no awareness that there's like actually an industry and there's like a whole like base of different like career you could have in that
S0328	yeah
S0383	it's like go and be a filmmaker not like okay you could work in production or you could work in like pr or you could
S0330	yeah
S0383	work in de de or you could be a light guy you could be a cameraman or you could be a director it be like there be no like comprehension of that whatsoever
S0330	mm
S0383	so people be just like aimlessly and like not aimlessly that's the but just like i there's no responsibility they just like put they're like oh you've get to create a spark and therefore you can become this thing that's not it's a you you get to exist in this different world
S0328	mm
S0383	so we're just gonna push you like wholeheartedly into it
S0330	yeah
S0383	and just like hope like on a wing and a prayer that you'll make it and kind of that sort of thing
S0326	but i just think but i think it's er it's not that difficult to sort of start to work that out those be the different things you can do
S0383	dude i'm only just work that out now and i'm twenty nine
S0326	but that's when you're like work you could i wanna be a director and you do some work experience that your school fix up for you somewhere
S0383	yeah in like
S0326	and then you're sort of like
S0383	not when but not when you come to
S0330	yeah
S0383	cos it doesn't exist
S0328	yeah
S0383	like you know that because you grow up and you grow up in like you you know you have friends and family
S0330	i agree
S0383	and blah blah blah that like work in those industries like people from
S0326	yeah
S0383	like fuck or or like they won't they have no comprehension of that whatsoever like i didn't meet anyone that even hear of any of half the shit until i be like have move to and be like and i'm only just realise half of that shit now like i didn't like go to my parents' house where like my mum's friend's like you know an art dealer or like work in
S0326	yeah yeah
S0383	you don't like have a conversation about francis bacon when i be like sixteen
S0328	yeah
S0383	like you
S0328	i be the same mm
S0383	you know it's like i'm only but then i meet other people and they've know that shit since they be like
S0328	it's like how the fuck do you do the world
S0383	fourteen
S0383	but also i feel
S0330	yeah
S0383	like a massive thing it's like it's just the we don't really have a creative economy we have like the way we make money in this country be like through finance
S0330	yeah
S0383	and through like market
S0330	yeah no i know but yeah
S0383	so but we have to build a creative economy to validate people invest money in our
S0330	yeah of course
S0383	country so it's like that's why there's this like irresponsible push to like be all our creative like our creative capital basically
S0330	yeah
S0383	cos it validate our like financial capital
S0330	yeah
S0383	but there's actually pretty much no industry there
S0330	yeah
S0383	apart from a service industry to the financial industry
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0383	so we have to build creative capital but without there necessarily be
S0330	yeah it be confuse
S0383	work
S0330	cos like when you when you talk about like have have people who who who who sort of have do those things before and you look look towards like all that all the examples that i can think of as a child be be like the professions basically like so all of my parents' you know friends and who they be and and like all like no one be a like there be one or two musicians who be like classical musicians or whatever who like play in an orchestra or be soloists or you know whatever but everyone else be doctor and lawyers and nurse and and teachers and you know
S0383	yeah
S0330	you know all those kind of like
S0383	no i be sort of say this to my friend the other day
S0330	and it's like
S0383	it be like that like you look at everyone and like you know what they do as a you're like
S0330	yeah
S0383	he's a greengrocer he's a lawyer
S0330	mm yeah
S0383	he's a doctor he's not like oh he's the guy that do this thing in that
S0330	yeah
S0383	world
S0330	yeah
S0383	it's like
S0330	although although at the same time like i remember very very clearly like ask like like have this like conversation with my grandpa who be my like a really important part of my of my childhood and him be like so what do you wanna be when you grow up and i be like oh man i dunno like i don't really know he be like well i'm still decide and he be like seventy five or eighty or whatever
S0383	yeah
S0330	and he be like you know cos cos because there's this idea that everybody have their you know what they wanna do but i be you know i do this and then i do that and i know these people who do this and then they do that and then they change their idea and i'm eighty two and i still don't know what i wanna be you know kind of thing and like
