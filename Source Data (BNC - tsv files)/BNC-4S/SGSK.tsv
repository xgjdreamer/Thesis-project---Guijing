S0058	we have that you know she mention to me oh yes i remember five years ago this thing happen ten years ago this thing happen and obviously the
S0470	we sometimes get textual query and you spend a long time work out a sensible answer because they expect us to have a particular level of expertise

S0470	mm
S0058	sort of you'd obviously you do need to promote new new products and i find it really interest it's not a new book but you need to find ways new ways of get people interest in
S0470	yes it's it's different ways
S0058	tradition or this be good text and you know for you or
S0470	yes there's different lead for example
S0058	absolutely
S0470	i've you know be write something about our giant print edition
S0058	oh yeah of course
S0470	we do giant print library and we're about to do it in the the reprint programme
S0058	mm mm
S0470	in eight volumes
S0058	oh very nice
S0470	so that's for people who be visually impair
S0058	yes yeah so
S0470	well people with visual impairments i think be the correct term
S0058	right yeah yeah no i erm my family kind of you know once they start one of them's you know do you do you sell bibles i'm after a new bible
S0470	oh really
S0058	ah so i give them the catalogue and
S0470	yeah
S0058	it's it's the first time i've really think about kind of buy one in that way you know find one that sort of yeah
S0470	yeah
S0058	and the
S0470	do you know what they choose
S0058	erm oh what be it it be one of the ones with the very soft leather be it i can't remember what the what the cover of it's really soft
S0058	might have be good you know
S0470	oh
S0058	really soft and like
S0470	top of the range then
S0058	my dad want a really nice one to read to keep and to have you know
S0470	mm
S0058	not like an everyday thing in your
S0470	do he read do he read it regularly
S0058	yeah and he want something that you could yeah read regularly but also be really nice to keep i think and
S0470	that's good yeah
S0058	he'd be give you know some money as a present what can i get that's really nice to keep
S0470	yeah you'll get your fifty percent stuff
S0058	exactly i think that be the initial thing for kind of thing
S0470	yes
S0470	oh i'm glad her find one that he like
S0058	yes so he be very impress
S0470	couldn't sell more of our and safes in here
S0058	oh right that's interest
S0470	we seem to be more will to spend a lot of money on a quality product
S0058	yeah yeah i wonder if people here be more in the kind of just something in every day just to carry round with you and not not worry too much about the actual book and more you know whether there's a difference between sort of
S0470	it's odd because people
S0058	yeah but how how many people
S0470	might spend a hundred pound on a pair of trainers
S0058	exactly yeah
S0470	a handbag
S0058	yeah and the book in general kind of if you've spend a lot on a edition but then think oh i don't really wanna yeah i'm the kinda person who'll a secondhand one
S0470	yeah
S0058	and well the word be the same
S0470	that's true
S0058	and
S0470	if you have something that's too expensive and you don't like to use it too much in case you
S0058	yeah exactly yeah
S0470	forget it i'm like that with jewellery if i've get very expensive earrings
S0058	yeah you can
S0470	i never wear them because i'm i use them all the time
S0058	yeah i've get a friend who even paperbacks he doesn't like like crease the spine he's very worry cos he just never take book anywhere and read them very carefully he just to
S0470	yeah things be mean to be use
S0058	exactly yeah but
S0470	and the bible should stand up to be heavily use
S0058	yeah yeah
S0470	so i think you should be able to
S0058	yeah exactly
S0470	a little bite rough with it
S0058	look at it kind of the point really yeah

S0058	yes yes that's one of the reason we do these these form be just to make sure that we're not only collect people from or only people from or only people age under thirty because obviously their language be gonna be different to

S0471	what be your erm background in
S0058	erm so i do a degree in english literature erm
S0471	okay
S0058	and then basically think i'm kind of interest in publish generally so i'll look for a job in publish and see see what i make of it
S0471	yeah
S0058	see if good and by coincidence the job that i get be erm the the kind of assistant on this team
S0471	okay
S0058	and just fell in love with it just really really love the job and
S0471	mm mm
S0058	the kind of research that we do and
S0471	yeah send these
S0058	and i just stick with it really
S0471	yeah
S0058	erm it yeah one of the things that i just have no idea about i never think about the idea of find out about language by collect lot of examples and
S0471	mm
S0058	it hadn't really occur to me and yeah
S0471	really great
S0058	end up stay with it it's really good
S0471	very lucky
S0058	yeah i'm so lucky
S0471	to find something you like
S0058	yeah i mean the plan be definitely to just try something out for a year and see how it go and four and a half years later erm
S0471	feel good
S0058	i think that kind of happen like my colleague have be here about the same amount of time as me and a similar kind of thing she's think really interest in languages
S0471	mm
S0058	let's find a languagey job and
S0471	kind of see yeah
S0058	just see how it go yeah
S0471	i do my undergrad in er english light as well
S0058	mm
S0471	no idea what to do
S0058	yeah it's really hard
S0471	yeah it's really hard
S0058	i think i be so jealous of like engineer who
S0471	i know they just kind of
S0058	yeah
S0471	know what to do and
S0471	they go and like i know there's a lot of different type of engineer that you can do but
S0058	mm
S0471	i mean yeah it seem like there's more of a straightforward path whereas english literature be pretty much you can what's the word translate across like many different you can feel it go to almost anything
S0058	mm
S0471	except for if it's technical or
S0058	yeah yeah it's transferrable skills rather than anything very vocational
S0058	yeah i think this job's quite nice cos it be kind of relate a bite to languages but
S0471	to language yeah of course
S0058	yeah it's such a different i dunno how like how you find study english literature but there's so much kind of make statements and think about things and
S0471	mm mm
S0058	read what other people have write whereas this be completely the opposite approach
S0471	yeah
S0058	just really like datary evidency
S0471	mm
S0058	erm
S0471	do you do any linguistics course in
S0058	nothing
S0471	i try i try to kind of do like a broader spectrum like i didn't just study english light erm i do like professional write so i be do edit and proofread and then i do something
S0058	right
S0471	want to see like which area english i be most interest in but then i couldn't decide
S0058	yeah
S0058	that's really nice like i go to the traditional university
S0471	mm mm
S0058	very very traditional ideas about how you study literature and
S0058	it be great it be really good and like
S0471	yeah
S0058	you know it i learn a lot but it there be no concept of like use a computer to support your study of literature
S0471	right
S0058	it's like book erm
S0471	yeah
S0058	and no one really be talk about this kind of thing yeah the link between literature and linguistics wasn't really talk about very much and
S0471	right
S0058	do you go to like do your undergrad in
S0471	canada
S0058	canada ah okay
S0471	yeah in yeah
S0058	yeah sound like it be a much kind of wide and
S0471	yeah it be very wide
S0471	you could choose you know i do english literature and erm like british english and then american like new age literature and
S0058	oh right
S0471	then like yeah philosophy course in literature so like study
S0058	that's really cool
S0471	aristotle and things like that and then new stuff like graphic novels and kind of like a big mix of whatever you wanna i think i do one in irish play as well which be quite fun
S0058	yeah
S0471	they be like very very violent from the seventies i remember
S0058	oh right
S0471	it be such an excellent course
S0471	but yeah i try to
S0058	yeah
S0471	just take a huge variety of
S0058	yeah
S0471	not to get bore anyway
S0058	that's great yeah i mean mine i dunno like we do quite a broad range i do old english and middle english and more modern stuff but it it be still very much kind of it be a you know you could do a little bite on kind of erm there be a module on american literature
S0471	mm right
S0058	and there be a module on erm sort of postcolonial study and various other things
S0471	yeah
S0058	but it be pretty much your traditional kind of
S0471	right
S0058	england from seven hundred to now
S0058	erm but mainly english to like eighteen hundred erm
S0471	right
S0058	and you know it be it be good it be interest but it be kind of quite quite narrow i think
S0471	yeah yeah
S0058	so it's it's nice now to just to read stuff
S0471	for fun
S0058	for fun and i read load of graphic novels now it's
S0471	i love them that be the best course i ever do
S0058	i'm so jealous
S0471	yeah it be really amaze
S0058	i'm like i'm still get into them but erm
S0471	yeah have you read yet
S0058	i haven't read yet i
S0471	you have to it's the best one
S0058	yeah be it okay
S0471	the best one i ever read for sure
S0471	hand down absolutely
S0058	it look really serious be it quite difficult
S0471	it's serious yeah it's not it's not a not a comedy
S0058	yeah
