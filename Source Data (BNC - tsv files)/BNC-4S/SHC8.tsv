S0370	you be part of the roman catholic church up until henry the eighth
S0012	henry the eighth yeah
S0370	erm you know and some of the crusade they do be not just against muslims but against other christians where they kill thousands
S0370	it be horrendous absolutely horrendous
S0012	but all through all through life ever since christianity begin there have be war and kill in the name of god
S0370	but but there always have be
S0012	and there always will be
S0370	but not just christian
S0012	i mean you know it in northern ireland
S0370	well no you have to be er you have to be slightly careful about ireland because
S0278	sectarian
S0370	it be sectarian but the easy way to define them be by religion because the irish be catholics and er those that be settlemented within the pale be all protestants
S0012	protestants yeah
S0370	hence the the label it's the easiest way to to to label people
S0012	yeah
S0370	yeah er so it be sectarian it's not religious
S0012	but how many er why why do we label people
S0370	well because it's an easy way to categorise people you can tell which church they go to
S0012	and then you you you have a conflict
S0370	yeah yeah but there there have always be conflict i mean i i i don't think you can you can say that yes things have be do in the name of christianity in the name of allah
S0370	erm but statistics show that roughly twenty percent of the world have always be at war it's never change
S0012	always
S0370	never get it's vary slightly but you know
S0012	somewhere in in the bible it say there'll be a war every twenty five years but there's be a war non stop somewhere in the world
S0370	well we're one of the worst countries
S0012	we be we always have be
S0370	we're almost permanently at war
S0012	yeah
S0370	we like to have our finger in the pie somewhere
S0012	and we're still at war
S0370	in we be in we're in afghanistan aren't we
S0012	yeah and not only afghanistan rwanda we're we're in we're in
S0370	not in now
S0012	well we come out
S0370	i mean at the moment we're in afghanistan
S0012	in afghanistan yeah but we've be all over africa like the dutch
S0370	oh yeah yeah
S0370	and the french and the germans
S0012	and the french and the germans and and everybody else
S0370	we're just the europeans who be the settlers weren't they
S0012	yeah
S0370	you know they they they be the ones take over
S0012	now be it true that there be er only two families one from africa and one from europe this be this be a a
S0370	well
S0013	no
S0370	but er i i think probably the the strongest theory be that er if you take adam and eve
S0012	yeah
S0370	not the christian story just
S0012	no
S0370	you know the first man and woman
S0012	yeah
S0370	they be african
S0012	they have to be
S0370	right and er whiten erm er be a a throw off genetic throw off or genetic variation and the people when the ice age come and people have to move further out
S0012	mm
S0370	if you be white you could survive in colder climates because if you're black you radiate heat more
S0012	it's true yeah
S0370	if you're white you don't radiate as much heat you're able to survive in colder climates that's why the black people be near the equator right and er er it seem to indicate the genetic er theories that they've get that black be the original
S0012	the original colour
S0370	colour yeah
S0012	yeah yeah
S0278	how do you say black radiate more heat when actually black absorb more heat
S0012	it do yeah
S0370	it do both
S0278	so so it's more uncomfortable to be that colour in the heat
S0370	it if no no no er if you're in a hot country
S0278	mm
S0370	if you're black and you're sit in the shade
S0278	mm
S0370	you cool better than a white person
S0278	oh okay yes i see
S0370	cos you radiate heat more
S0278	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0370	right but if you're in a cold environment
S0278	yeah
S0370	you're radiate more body heat than a white person be
S0278	mm
S0370	so white people be capable of survive in colder climates
S0012	yeah
S0370	hence as as people get push out from the more populate areas or this be my area for my tribe you mate get out this be my space
S0370	territorial erm the ones that get push into the cold areas the ones that survive the be the ones with the paler skin
S0012	this er
S0370	so you get the genetic modification
S0012	i i i i think chinese totally different race and the er
S0370	well they say not you see they say
S0012	then the inuit's go up into
S0370	well the inuit's look very chinese
S0012	they be chinese aren't they yes and and this be the inuit's come from china
S0278	that's before the straits be break they would've walk across from
S0370	look
S0012	yeah
S0370	look at the variations of dog we've get from north
S0012	we'll that's true yeah but that's only because we interbreed em ain't it that's that's er
S0370	yeah
S0012	human intervention
S0370	yes but this this be as people move the the group that go over towards china
S0012	that's true yeah
S0370	have the genetic makeup
S0012	yeah
S0370	that mean that they they develop in one way so and and er they don't call it gondwanaland any more but originally they call it gondwanaland when all the continents be one lump
S0012	that's right yeah
S0370	and they believe that this be because the other lump of the crust be tear off and form the moon when the earth be in early development you see it get rip off
S0012	that's right yeah
S0370	so you have a big chunk of crust and the rest be water and over time it's try to balance itself up
S0012	yeah
S0370	so it's move apart and so bits that move there when it separate they then begin to genetically develop independently
S0013	mm
S0370	and so you know traits that they have so that's why i mean we we don't have inbreeding do we you're not allow to to marry anybody closer than a cousin
S0012	well that's true yeah or you weren't
S0370	because the genetic material
S0012	unless you live in norfolk
S0370	unless you live in norfolk of course yeah
S0370	erm but you get that's why
S0013	there be no no real no law at the best time you just
S0012	no
S0370	well they argue this be why they have certain genetic problems down in cornwall because
S0013	yeah
S0370	they've a small isolate populations and there be inbreeding
S0012	if there be no transport as we know it today
S0370	mm
S0012	what be you go to do in a village
S0013	yourselves isn't it
S0012	i mean a village become a village when there's so many people but there's so many people interbreed with their other with cousins
S0370	yeah mm mm mm
S0013	mm
S0012	aunts and uncles they didn't know
S0370	and if you get too much of it then you get certain traits you might get good traits you might get bad traits
S0012	your bad traits yeah
S0370	you tend to notice the bad ones more don't you
S0012	you do yeah yeah
S0370	yeah yeah but er erm the chinese er the black hair for instance and it's not just chinese it's japanese as well
S0012	it's japanese as well yeah
S0370	dominant gene
S0012	yeah
S0370	so er if you marry a chinese person or a japanese person your children will have black hair
S0012	mm
S0370	predominant
S0370	the likelihood of red hair or fair hair come through be practically zilch
S0012	yeah
S0370	just get
S0012	so where do red hair come from
S0013	where where do any of the families come from
S0012	yeah well
S0370	where do what
S0012	red hair come from
S0370	it a it's a genetic throw off isn't it
S0012	it's a genetic
S0370	yeah yeah
S0012	but they call them irish don't they
S0370	well the probably the group of people that move into the british the first group of people tribe that go into the british isles have red hair
S0012	yeah
S0370	because the er north west scotland and north west ireland the furthest extremes of the british isles
S0370	be where you've get the redheads
S0012	yeah but
S0370	that's where the vast majority of redhead people be
S0012	but i think
S0370	and then the you've get the druids haven't you
S0370	with black hair then you've get the saxons
S0370	right and then you've get the romans which be very romans be the first sort of real multicultural group weren't they
S0012	they be yeah but scotland weren't anything to do with england or the british isles at one time scotland be out here britain be here and scotland just join it you have you have the actual
S0278	it's where loch ness be
S0370	i think that split be where it's move away not
S0370	no that's where it join
S0013	yeah i think it be i think it be move
S0012	that's where we join i'm sure it sure it's where we join
S0013	yeah
S0370	not that i be aware of i think it be
S0278	i think it be move away cos it's too precise
S0370	it's a rift valley
S0012	yeah it's a rift valley
S0278	that's that be so precise
S0370	but a rift valley be pull rifting pull apart
S0278	mm
S0012	but it's not move away now
S0370	it probably be
S0278	you could've get two land mass to join together with such precision
S0370	it probably be move away
S0013	yeah
S0278	as it be it's just gently move away so it's it's precisely it's almost the same equidistant apart all the way through isn't it
S0370	i mean certainly
S0278	not a lot of difference there
S0370	yeah the irish sea be erm be marshland
S0012	yeah
S0370	and you could move between the two
S0012	well we once move between well we be part of europe
S0278	mm
S0370	well scandinavia probably
S0012	yes all that part
S0370	well when well we scandinavians view themselves as not european don't they
S0012	they do they do
S0370	interestingly enough
S0012	and so the
S0370	very much so yeah i think finland
S0012	and ireland not ireland iceland yeah
S0370	norway sweden and iceland see themselves as er and greenland
S0012	and greenland yeah
S0370	see themselves as a cos
S0370	a lot of them move out greenland be in actual fact very close to iceland and
S0012	yes it be yeah
S0370	and norway
S0370	if you go across that way we see it as be a huge distance don't we
S0013	mm
S0012	we do yeah
S0370	but for them actually it's
S0370	you're go up near the top and it's just a
S0012	just across the road
S0370	stone throw over yeah
S0370	yeah it's not far at all
S0012	it's very strange
S0370	realise how far it be
S0013	no
S0012	and and we're still move the continents be still move and move apart or move towards each other
S0370	we're move apart i think be it er something like
S0278	we're move apart
S0370	be it two and a half centimetres a year or something
S0012	something like that yeah
S0370	the atlantic be get wider
S0278	and there's some bits down near erm i think it's just off the north west coast of africa if er if that bite there's bits perch down below sea level if it break off the tidal wave will go right across the atlantic
S0370	oh okay okay
S0278	and it will swamp the whole of erm new york and way inland as well
S0012	yeah you have a fault right
S0012	in the middle of of the atlantic
S0278	this this this be this be some bite of bite of land off africa
S0012	but there be a fault in the middle of the atlantic and it they say if that fault
S0012	actually split
S0278	mm
S0012	there would be one huge tsunami
S0278	yeah
S0012	across britain and new york
S0012	and it would flood britain
S0012	we would we would not er
S0278	probably yeah yeah
S0012	we would not exist any more
S0370	mm
S0012	but if if as you say we be move away and the atlantic be get
S0370	i'd better start build my boat hadn't i
S0012	and er the atlantic be get
S0013	yeah
S0012	bigger that mean russia and all that have
S0012	go round the other side to
S0370	they're all move move in different ways though aren't they
S0012	well if if the atlantic be get bigger there's the atlantic there and there's the pacific there if we're move round we're go to smash into america some time or and make
S0370	america's move away from us at the moment
S0012	yeah which way
S0370	away
S0012	so move that way
S0370	but but the cos it if you think about it
S0012	and we're move that way we're go to we're go to the whole earth's crust
S0370	yeah but you've get the whole pacific ocean to
S0012	yeah it will take it'll take millions of years yeah but
S0370	i mean yeah by which time our sun's probably be burn out
S0370	yeah
S0012	yeah that's true
S0370	and anyway it's not a crash like that be it
S0012	no
S0370	it's it it it it
S0012	but this be how the himalayas become about
S0370	oh yeah yeah er the alps be still go up aren't they you see
S0012	yeah
S0370	so that bite be push
S0012	yeah
S0370	and they're still rise the er erm er yeah the er the in erm yeah the himalayas er be rise at the moment still they're go up
S0012	but also erode
S0370	i'm not sure er no i think they're get taller at the moment
S0012	yeah but they're also they might be get taller but they be
S0370	there there there will be yes the ice action but no they won't be they won't be much because they're permanently freeze it's only when you get freeze and thaw
S0012	yeah
S0370	that you get the erosion isn't it
S0012	and with with er the world's
S0370	and it's it's permafrost so
S0012	and with the world heat up
S0370	well
S0012	we have we have melt
S0012	we have a melt
S0370	well people have still get an argument about this haven't they the the
S0012	er yeah yeah
S0370	still argue that we we have fluctuations of ice age and heat wave
S0012	and every every every eleven years there's apparently
S0370	well and much bigger cycle as well
S0012	yeah
S0370	yeah cos we have a mini ice age didn't we
S0370	in the fifteen hundreds be it
S0370	oh when do the thames freeze over
S0012	in the victorian time
S0370	fifteen hundreds
S0012	the victorians actually skate on the on the
S0370	oh
S0012	on the river
S0370	but no earlier i think they have you know they have
S0278	they have bonfires on it and fair
S0370	boar and boar fire you know boar roast and so on on the ice
S0278	yeah oh yeah yeah
S0012	quite weird ain't it
S0278	so it regularly use to freeze well you can remember er erm the river freeze over and we take our bike on
S0013	yeah
S0278	be daft wasn't it we have our bike on it
S0012	well when i be a kid
S0278	what year be that sixty three or four or something like that
S0012	sixty three be the worst
S0370	i wasn't there then i didn't i didn't go to till sixty six
S0278	completely freeze over so solid you could walk on it and take our bike on it
S0012	it be the worst winter ever in do you know it it freeze two foot down in sixty three if you can imagine
S0012	two foot frost
S0278	mm
S0012	how deep the do the water pip go
S0278	they're suppose to be that deep
S0012	they're suppose to be
S0278	they probably aren't
S0012	and what be they make out that of then
S0370	lead
S0012	lead
S0370	yeah
S0012	and there be no end of problems
S0012	i remember we have a we have a neighbour across the road and he be a plumber i mean a real plumber not one of these pipe fitters
S0013	mm
S0012	a plumber that wipe
S0012	lead pip
S0278	yeah
S0370	where do the name plumber come from
S0012	lead
S0370	yeah the the plumbo be latin for lead
S0012	the plumbo be yeah i know mm
S0278	so plumbob
S0012	and a plumbob be a
S0278	father have his own way of fix lead pip and that be to open up the hole with a drill put in a matchstick tap it over the top
S0370	that's right i've do that
S0278	and then he and then he use to erm he use to wrap up with cloth and paint
S0012	mm
S0370	yeah and and the cloth and paint be a load of rubbish
S0278	and it be cloth and paint and it be erm
S0278	erm what do you use round the windows mix with
S0370	putty
S0278	with putty
S0278	and and just wrap a big bandage with
S0278	every time he wind it round he put more of this jollop on
S0012	mm
S0278	right so he end up with a sort of a bandage
S0012	that's right a big bandage i remember all
S0370	but all you have to do be the the a a a bite of wood be good because it swell
S0278	you tap it over
S0278	yeah
S0370	and then you just dress the lead over the top
S0012	and then you wipe it over yeah
S0370	yeah
S0012	you wake
S0278	yeah
S0012	very clever
S0370	you use a moleskin didn't you to wipe it over
S0012	moleskin yep
S0370	mm
S0012	dad use to keep moleskins
S0012	kill the moles and keep the skin
S0370	mm
S0012	cos that be the best and a and a superb polish cloth which he use to polish his army boot what'd he call it bone spit and polish
S0278	spit and polish oh yes i can do that
S0012	bone spit and polish
S0278	bone you no the expression you bone em up you bone em up be to get rid of the bubble
S0012	yeah but he use to
S0370	but you use to spoon it didn't you
S0278	we spoon it
S0370	spoon we use to spoon
S0012	yeah but he use to call it bone spit and polish
S0012	i mean that be
S0370	so he probably use a bone instead of a spoon
S0012	probably yeah mm
S0370	as the hard
S0012	yeah
S0370	cos a spoon be good because you yeah you could heat it up and you could take the the bump off the leather
S0278	yeah mm
S0370	but also you could spoon your wax polish as it harden first
S0012	yeah yeah
S0370	to shape it and then you spat on it
S0370	so it didn't stick on the spoon
S0012	yeah
S0370	yeah we use to spend hours do that in
S0012	my dad his his
S0370	and then you go on parade and some nasty toerag would come along and scuff across the top
S0370	just as you be about to go on parade
S0012	you could see your face in my dad's boot
S0370	not after they'd scuff em
S0012	not after they scuff em no but they use to be
S0370	mind you i use to scuff other people's as well so
S0012	that be a job that we have to do
S0370	we think it be funny
S0012	every week
S0012	every week we have to polish either the the silver or the boot
S0370	oh we do we do we do we polish at home
S0013	yeah we do
S0370	we use to do the brass stair rods
S0013	oh gosh yeah
S0370	yeah and the and the
S0370	and the and the er the the
S0370	fire surround thing
S0370	what do you call it the not grate erm
S0012	the fender
S0370	fender
S0013	mm
S0370	it be mainly the fender and there be a brass erm tray we have in the hall
S0012	yeah
S0013	that's right
S0370	we use to polish that
S0278	yeah
S0013	and the money plate
S0012	amaze the stuff
S0278	from pakistan or something that be
S0012	i dunno
S0013	lovely plate
S0012	who's get that now er nobody
S0012	i don't know i haven't get it
S0278	i haven't
S0370	mm
S0012	probably
S0370	no no no
S0013	no no
S0370	no it be in our house
S0012	be it oh right
S0013	mm
S0278	oh i remember the no i remember the plate
S0278	there be also a a a brass table wasn't there that probably come from india but there be a brass top table
S0013	mm
S0012	i think the table be 's and have it
S0278	oh no there be a lovely brass plate
S0012	yeah but lot of people go round after and have lot of stuff from your mum's place
S0013	yeah they do
S0278	mm
S0013	mm that be awful that be
S0012	so call christians again help them out
S0370	do they
S0012	yeah
S0278	who be
S0013	those people that befriend them yeah
S0012	people that befriend your mum and dad
S0013	not swap things
S0012	yeah
S0278	oh she lose her i buy some i spend my first first week's earn on this lovely waterford glass crystal necklace for her
S0013	oh yeah yeah
S0278	all of it
S0012	what about you
S0278	that that disappear
S0012	didn't you
S0278	and it be replace by another one
S0013	be it
S0370	oh be it oh
S0012	didn't you didn't you
S0013	mm
S0012	catch them run up the road
S0370	that be
S0012	that be be it
S0278	yeah i catch em
S0013	mm
S0370	that be antique dealers
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0370	supposedly
S0012	but they have a lot of knockers go on the door
S0013	mm
S0012	they even pinch the knock the the door
S0278	that be no that be after they'd die
S0013	that be afterwards
S0012	be it
S0013	mm mm
S0370	yeah before the house before i get the probate
S0013	mm
S0012	mm
S0370	somebody break in the back and so that the could take the letterbox and the
S0013	mm
S0370	and the knocker
S0370	mm
S0278	that be bronze not brass
S0370	it be bronze yeah
S0370	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	amaze though ain't it
S0278	and the nameplate
S0370	no the nameplate didn't go
S0278	nameplate stay well it match it all didn't it
S0370	well you couldn't unscrew that
S0278	couldn't no
S0370	no no mm
S0012	it's amaze what people'll do though ain't it
S0012	when they see an empty house
S0370	i think well probably the knocker and the letterbox be the builders next door because they be do some build work next door
S0278	on the side or the other
S0370	yeah well it be call then wasn't it the mencap own it
S0278	oh be it i didn't know
S0370	yeah for age
S0013	mm
S0370	move out age ago
S0278	i know move oh yeah i didn't know it go to mencap
S0370	and it become and the group be
S0370	mencap
S0013	mm
S0370	yeah
S0012	what be it now have you ever see no
S0370	i don't really go down there very often now no
S0012	no
S0370	no
S0013	mm
S0012	but it wouldn't be like we know it would it you have cos er
S0013	no
S0012	that be only the only one i think
S0278	you'd recognise the house still
S0370	yeah

S0013	ah
S0012	where do they all park
S0370	mm
S0012	where do they all park
S0370	oh
S0370	i annoy our neighbour a bite i think you know the one who's get the drive that come out
S0012	yeah yeah
S0278	well if he move his car he doesn't use and tuck it away you could drive straight
S0370	well his garage be pile up with stuff you see his double car garage
S0370	but that that be be er
S0370	er it's fair enough er if if i be live there i think blow me you know they've park the car outside their house where i want to reverse out
S0012	yeah
S0370	on my drive and it be it be on a you know it be like that
S0278	yes
S0370	so
S0278	and he's in the corner
S0370	mm
S0278	and he's in the corner
S0370	he's in the corner unfortunately
S0278	yeah so if he reverse in he could drive out better
S0370	so he can't park in my way but we can park outside out house house in his way
S0278	mm
S0370	and it be it's awkward
S0013	mm
S0370	but as he quite rightly accept we're perfectly entitle to park there but it's downright awkward for me
S0370	you know
S0013	yeah
S0278	they come out when i be park there once and say er can you move it up a little bite further
S0370	that's right yeah
S0278	which be fair enough if you can
S0370	yeah
S0370	but if he didn't have his swing seat and his
S0278	yeah
S0370	bamboo on that side he could move the car over and he wouldn't have the same problem
S0370	and if he if he didn't have his garage full of junk
S0370	he if he be park in the garage he would be reverse out nice and clear you see
S0278	but if he swap his spare car
S0278	he with that drive straight in
S0370	well his wife use that car but she doesn't use it very often
S0278	oh i see
S0370	yeah yeah
S0278	have er have he still get have he still
S0370	and he have get it over there because if it's over there it's not block the route to their front door

S0278	yeah
S0370	but it's still get the for sale sign up

S0013	yes
S0012	yes you do you saw when you go down there
S0013	yeah
S0370	oh when you go and get the bits
S0012	mm yeah
S0370	so you get all the do he give you the wood
S0012	no we're get the wood tomorrow
S0013	get some wood
S0370	he say you could have the wood do he
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	get some wood
S0370	yeah cos he's not gonna use that wood
S0012	no
S0370	no
S0012	but we get all the wood all the square wood that cost three pound each and five pound each and
S0370	oh right
S0013	yeah
S0370	and he just give it to you
S0012	he give us all that
S0013	yeah
S0370	yeah
S0012	and now he's get a cupboard full of other wood that he's and season
S0370	that's right and the australian seed pot and so on
S0012	yeah that's it yeah
S0370	yeah
S0012	we're get all that tomorrow as well
S0370	great yeah that bargain
S0012	yeah
S0370	cos that's probably fifty plus quid's worth of wood you see
S0012	must be
S0370	and the rest
S0012	must be more than that yeah
S0370	probably more yeah
S0012	yeah
S0370	yeah
S0013	mm
S0370	but it's no use to him except for burn so
S0012	and all his and all his tool
S0370	he might as well let you have it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	and all his you know
S0370	and you've get all the chisel
S0012	i've get all his chisel and hole borers
S0370	yeah
S0012	and the lot you know
S0370	yeah mm
S0013	mm
S0012	and the big long drill that go
S0370	oh for do table lamps yeah
S0012	table lamps yeah
S0370	mm
S0012	mm so
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah it's
S0370	i be look at erm er jig that people have make up for erm copy router lathes
S0012	oh yeah
S0370	it's where you mount the router on er a ninety degree arm
S0012	yeah
S0370	because a ninety degree arm you you you're go back on the template there
S0012	yeah
S0370	and it's the same distance away be you with me so
S0012	yeah
S0370	cos if you have it on the same arm you get the differential in the amount it move so you have to have a smaller template
S0012	that's right yeah
S0370	for it to work
S0013	mm
S0370	whereas the ninety one work quite it tuck itself underneath the lathe
S0012	yeah
S0370	and you mount a a router in it so rather than use er a turn chisel turn tool you use the router cos the router's whiz round right and you can you can reproduce things the same
S0012	oh yeah
S0013	mm
S0370	size every time
S0012	oh that's brilliant ain't it
S0370	right and then if you if the finish isn't good enough though i've see them on youtube be use and it doesn't seem that bad
S0013	no
S0370	but you can always make it slightly bigger the template can't you
S0012	yeah
S0370	and then just
S0012	yeah
S0370	just turn the last bite down yourself
S0012	i didn't know whether to buy router router table as well he's he's he's make a table with his router on that you can just go
S0370	but you can make one yourself can't you
S0012	well i could do yeah
S0013	we've get a good router now haven't we
S0012	we've get a big router this be a little one which be
S0370	cos i buy a router table the other day my first one i build be just a board
S0012	yeah
S0370	with a er a wing nut and a bolt
S0370	and a strip of wood
S0012	yeah
S0370	on on er another bolt at the other end so you could move it closer or further away
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0370	to the router bite and i clamp it onto the black and decker workmate
S0012	yeah
S0370	work perfectly well
S0012	yeah
S0370	yeah do the job yeah that's all he's get there now really isn't it

S0370	do you want them will you use em
S0012	well
S0370	probably won't will you
S0012	you only use a couple don't you when you're use em
S0370	well if you're cramp up a door
S0370	you will use quite a few but
