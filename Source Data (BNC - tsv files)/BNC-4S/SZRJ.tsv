S0379	she don't like he do she
S0104	no they're not really but it's it's not though she's can't stand her
S0379	i mean the trouble be that they're
S0104	i i'm sure she's slightly bipolar they have a bad christmas they all go out there mum no it be after
S0167	this be a few years ago wasn't it
S0104	years ago it be after dad die i think it be the first christmas the no not cos she be here the first christmas after dad die so that be two thousand and ten it must have be two thousand and eleven
S0167	so be about eighteen months wasn't he
S0104	yeah
S0167	cos he be only a baby
S0104	they go out er and and go out there for christmas and so do mum and then my mum get there a few days before and and she say it be lovely be fine and i mean and she say the day and arrive she just turn and then have the most awful christmas she be scream at she be spend half her time in her bedroom everything they do be wrong erm be just spend the whole time upstairs try to calm her down and dad be and he be sort of tear between the two
S0379	his family and his wife
S0104	you know his family upstairs and and be there and at one point she'd pack her bag and 's bag and go and sit out on the porch i'm go
S0104	just sit on the porch with her suitcase and erm it be just horrendous apparently and you know say we be stick out in canada we we couldn't do anything but
S0379	oh they go to canada
S0104	yeah this be in canada
S0379	oh sorry i think you mean france
S0104	yeah and erm they couldn't you know say if we could have just pack our case actually in fact do at one point say i'm gonna phone up and change the ticket get the ticket change and then mum say well no don't do that don't leave me
S0379	do your mum get your mum get on with her though doesn't she
S0104	yeah but she still mum think she's weird but like i say you have to get on with your you know sons or daughters in law cos otherwise you know
S0379	you wouldn't see them would you
S0104	it would drive a wedge between
S0379	how do he meet her
S0104	through work
S0379	in canada or
S0104	he be work in canada on something some and he meet her there er so yeah so they have this awful time and it take an awful long time she i don't think she's ever really have never forgive her and he talk to her now and he's he's sort of but erm
S0379	never forgive her for what for like
S0104	well oh for that and you know of course they be come two or three thousand pound to go out there for christmas and she go
S0379	to be treat like that
S0104	and also on one occasion have do something i can't remember what she'd do she'd do something
S0167	use the wrong dishcloth or something
S0104	use the wrong
S0167	i don't know
S0104	utensil or kitchen utensil for something or other and mum say he she be in her face like this and at that point step in and say don't you dare talk to my wife like that back off you know and and they have a big row and then and then she go upstairs cry and they didn't see her for a day this be what
S0379	over a dishcloth
S0104	oh it be something that
S0167	really small yeah
S0104	it be something in the kitchen have use for the wrong thing you know and not forget they have an eighteen month old with them at the time as well you know he be a little bite confuse and erm so and it take a long time to sort of
S0104	be civil to
S0379	mm
S0104	after that cos she say i never ever get an apology she say i do get an email erm
S0379	what be you look for love
S0104	about a year later
S0373	glass
S0104	which refer to that christmas and it wasn't an apology but it be and she think well that's the best i'm gonna get so ever since then
S0379	but the trouble be be
S0104	's less tolerant of her than she use to be and hasn't get any time for her at all he talk to her and that but and yet she's amaze with the kid the kid absolutely adore her
