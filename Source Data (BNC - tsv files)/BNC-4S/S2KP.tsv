S0192	limescale that's hard water
S0230	so that's hard water

S0198	huh
S0229	nice little pattern on it
S0198	i do i like it i like green go with the brown and the blue and the orange
S0192	it's a real nice mix of
S0230	these be greenish
S0198	no they're not what be you look at
S0230	well that's greenish in the middle isn't it
S0192	which bite be you look at
S0192	the square i mean i i i would say that be kind of green
S0198	be there a bite of green in there
S0230	sort of a bluey green
S0198	it's not black
S0192	blue oh well i dunno if i'd go for bluey green
S0230	mm
S0192	i'd go for like a browny greyey green
S0230	mm
S0229	browny greyey yellow
S0198	i think the word's black you're look for fade black
S0192	ah which bite be we talk about here
S0229	the square
S0192	the bite you're look at's different to mine
S0192	you're look at that bite aren't you
S0230	yeah
S0192	i i be look at the that that colour
S0230	mm
S0192	yeah that's a bluey
S0192	it's like a bluey grey
S0230	mm
S0198	it's like fade black
S0198	which i guess in to a certain er at one at some point a fade do kind of look green
S0192	we've er squabble a few time over colour
S0198	that's cos you've get you blue and your purple confuse
S0192	whatever
S0229	so be you do homework tonight
S0198	yeah should do yeah
S0192	yeah we have to
S0198	don't feel much like it now but probably try and do a bite of read or something just gotta do a little bite of something to make yourself not feel so bad
S0198	say it's connect to that wi fi
S0229	i dunno what these other bits be oh it's er earphones
S0230	have you have to get more contact lenses since you've be home
S0198	no
S0230	no
S0198	these be the same
S0192	you buy some just before we leave
S0198	yeah i buy er
S0198	but these be the same ones i open i think when i first get back i don't think i've open any more
S0230	mm
S0198	cos i don't erm i mean i don't know i don't know actually how long these be mean to last the ones i get in korea because i get them in and i want some that say like a week or two
S0229	ah
S0198	and they give me these ones that they might just be a week or two week ones that you're mean to dispose of but i don't wear them every day and i don't wear them all day every day now i'll put them in just before i go to uni and then i take them out when i get home and erm these ones have be fine they've last much better
S0192	adapter on that
S0229	you put the other
S0198	so i don't change them
S0229	if you go travel
S0198	they tell you not to do that of course but i only change them until i can't use them anymore
S0229	you get your two pin one you can plug in when you go abroad
S0192	when you go belgium
S0229	yeah
S0198	and they do get you can tell once cos you can't even tell the vision's not
S0230	mm
S0192	that's a good idea isn't it rather than make you buy another one
S0229	yeah
S0230	mm
S0198	you can tell when one of them's get a scratch or sometimes
S0192	it just slot in
S0229	press that there look
S0192	should all be like that
S0198	i can't really see that well out of this and then i hold it up to the light
S0198	and it's actually get a little split in it so it just affect your vision a little bite you can tell but these ones have be really good since i've get back i dunno if it's cos it's less humid i dunno why they've be behave much better
S0230	so when you want new ones you go to the opticians do you
S0198	yeah in korea i just hand in my box of my last one
S0192	yeah it's just like go to the shop
S0198	and they be just over the counter
S0230	oh
S0198	whereas in england they'll probably check your eye more often
S0229	that's for your laptop
S0192	oh be that for transfer any photos you've take
S0229	yeah
S0198	maybe not too often
S0230	yeah
S0198	once they but to initially get them in england you have to go through a whole checkup trial period with them whereas in korea they just give them to me
S0229	yeah
S0192	seem crazy
S0229	yeah
S0198	and i have to take a box in and stuff there might be more to it technically
S0198	but maybe cos i'm foreign they don't worry about it
S0192	oh well their loss our gain eh
S0198	so yeah
S0230	i suppose
S0198	they're cheaper in korea
S0192	oh it come with a case as well
S0229	yeah
S0192	have you see the case
S0198	ah i don't know what the
S0192	would you wear it on your belt or something
S0198	no it's not
S0229	it's just a protective case
S0198	yeah it's just a it doesn't go through a belt yeah it's just to keep it
S0229	yeah
S0198	so you don't lose lose it in your bag and scratch it and that i suppose
S0230	i suppose if you drop it it give it some protection as well
S0198	yeah
S0229	or lean on it
S0198	just to protect it in the bag
S0192	like the laptop
S0198	tap it up it's fine
