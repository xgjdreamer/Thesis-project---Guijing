S0198	yeah
S0233	yeah it's kind of
S0198	anything above thirty's get a bite high
S0192	thirty five be nasty
S0233	it's a different kind of heat though as well cos like
S0234	it's you know even if you're in the shade you feel it
S0192	yeah yeah
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah the difference in
S0192	even korea i mean korea's not that far south but the humidity be like a hundred percent for two months of the year

S0234	yeah we have air con
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0234	although

S0198	smoke it away probably
S0192	too many cigarettes
S0198	mm
S0192	the apartment's spacious at least it's private although nobody tell us we have a nursery if you lean forward
S0198	ah it's terrible
S0233	be out soon like
S0198	yeah but during the week
S0192	but we'll be study in the day
S0198	nine to five all you can hear be scream
S0192	their scream
S0198	children cos they're play outside every day
S0233	you'll have to find out free
S0234	well look over the winter maybe you'll be
S0192	that's what i think do you like children
S0234	er i don't like other people's children
S0233	get three nephews
S0198	ah have you have you get just the one brother no
S0234	i've get er three brothers
S0198	oh wow okay
S0192	big family
S0198	i forget about that do you see your brother in america that's in america
S0234	yeah we saw him
S0198	be that a reason for go yeah
S0233	well it's a
S0234	well it it be a bonus
S0198	yes kill two bird with one stone
S0192	where be you in the hierarchy of siblings
S0234	erm second from last penultimate
S0192	oh penultimate
S0234	yeah but it's a bite weird cos erm there's seven years between me and the eldest and me and the youngest
S0192	yeah
S0234	so i'm
S0192	so you're equidistant between
S0234	yeah i'm equidistant so i sort of feel like i'm in the middle but
S0192	but i guess you can't be in the middle i've get a new brother he's like five years old now
S0234	oh wow
S0192	there's a massive difference between us half brother obviously but erm yeah my mum be forty seven when she have him
S0234	wow okay
S0192	i only have one full sibling and now i have a half sibling as well bite strange yeah five years old bite weird when you're like twenty eight and you've get a brother that's five
S0234	yeah yeah that be
S0192	i don't really know what to do with it
S0234	i be try yeah so yeah cos be my eldest be only yeah he be fourteen obviously when
S0192	yeah
S0234	be bear so he be nineteen when be five
S0192	that's a pretty big age difference still
S0234	yeah that's that's like normally that's about the biggest that i've hear of actually
S0192	yeah yeah so now this be twenty three years it just worry me cos when he's older like i mean he's be alive for five years and i have live out of the country for six years so i don't really know him yeah i've probably be in england for three or four months out of that whole six years so that's all i've see really since nowadays we have skype and stuff so it's he chat to me and i see him grow up but it's a bite strange your brother's someone that you grow up with you know i mean not just not just someone with
S0234	yeah no that's what i be just think actually i be just think i wonder i mean that's i definitely like with like i feel probably slightly closer to my elder brothers because obviously when although i grow up with there be like pretty much when he be in i guess his informative years you know when he when you're sort of a teenager
S0192	yeah
S0234	i'd go off to university
S0192	yeah
S0234	so i didn't see him as you know
S0192	so you drift a little bite
S0234	yeah i think so whereas obviously when i when i be a teenager at least be still around and my eldest be still around a bite and then he go off
S0192	yeah be you close with your your brothers now
S0234	yeah yeah like we see each other quite a lot actually erm
S0192	that's good
S0234	so that's quite good but it's yeah it's kind of i mean it's difficult i mean it's difficult even with friends i think nowadays too
S0192	yeah
S0234	cos everyone move around so although both my brothers be relatively one's in yeah which be just north of london
S0192	yeah i i know
S0234	yeah
S0192	i'm from so
S0234	oh okay
S0192	i know i know that area
S0234	erm and then the other one be in basically in pretty close outside of so obviously when i be in it be quite funny cos when i ring my parent to say i'm go to go erm to to do my phd they be like oh 's move to like to the there
S0192	yeah
S0234	and it's like the same it be the same weekend
S0192	coincidence yeah that's fortunate
S0234	erm so i saw quite a lot of then but yeah it's er
S0192	my brother my proper brother be erm go to uni at the same time that we be as well but he's go to erm but he's twenty four so he should have go to uni when he be eighteen nineteen but he never do he go to college kinda fluff that a couple of time so it's a bite coincidental that we're both go to uni at the same time not too far either be it from
S0234	well also probably again be like you just go into london and then
S0192	yeah that's the problem isn't it it's sixty miles as the the crow fly but you have to go up to london and then back
S0234	the high speed obviously
S0192	yeah yeah and high expense it's never cheap be it those train i look into a return to canterbury so sixty miles the way it take us be it wasn't through london it be through ashford i think
S0234	okay
S0192	and it be gonna cost about forty pound for a day return and it be still gonna take three hours to do sixty miles so an average speed of twenty miles an hour on the train i mean we're talk third world speed here at that point you know what i mean twenty miles an hour erm and i many time in nepal which i remember that clearly cos i calculate how long it be take us the amount of ten twelve hour journey we be do and only cover like a hundred miles or a hundred kilometres sometimes i mean you'd be like average speed of fifteen kilometres for the last twelve hours
S0192	it be terrible
S0234	that's painful
S0192	it really be it really be what tea do you ask for
S0234	er peppermint
S0192	peppermint i don't drink tea myself
S0234	well i don't really which be why i ask for er
S0192	fruit tea
S0234	either the fruit tea or the herbals
S0192	yeah
S0234	i don't drink i do sometimes like when i'm at a conference
S0192	yeah
S0234	i do drink erm
S0192	it's part of the right
S0234	well it be it's weird you just feel you feel really strange if you go to a conference and everyone's stand around with a cup of coffee
S0192	and you're not
S0234	ah it's hot
S0233	it remind me so much of the fact that bristol
S0198	yeah
S0233	it's the way that erm
S0198	maintain
S0233	landlords kinda give this stuff like
S0198	it's within a landlord's interest to maintain a property
S0233	that's fine
S0198	she didn't like those and she didn't
S0233	no that's totally you know
S0198	oh no no this be peppermint
S0233	oh be it
S0198	rubbish area
S0233	be that just cos of where you like
S0198	think i've lose the card you give me where do i put it

S0198	well cos we want to go back to
S0192	well we want to go back they combine a delta with an ma in one year you could do them both together which be cost effective and get it kind of out the way but they stop run that course so we couldn't do that
S0198	no
S0192	then we want to go to edinburgh and then they put up the fee by two grand they be
S0198	yeah it be eight grand for the tuition

S0198	oh
S0192	interest
S0233	erm so the master be mphils and they do different kinds of mphils teach or research
S0198	yeah
S0233	and mine be teach
S0192	be a master's of philosophy an mphil
S0198	okay and how much be that
S0233	that be about four and a half thousand pound
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's definitely
S0198	you have some additional cost though i remember you say college charge and things like that
S0233	yeah i have to pay i have to have to pay a college fee which i can't remember how much it be but yeah
S0192	that's what you be talk
S0233	it mostly my issue with go to be be that the college need a guarantee that you're go to be able to provide evidence of your live cost for the next year
S0198	mm
S0233	so basically i have to show them how i be go to live because you're not allow to work
S0198	okay
S0233	erm
S0192	you're not allow to work
S0234	no it's actually against college er statute
S0233	you need to ask like you can get work
S0192	interest
S0233	like you maybe you can get sort of like some work do sort of tutor or things like that but generally you would have to ask for special permission
S0234	you can't go and work at sainsbury's
S0233	no you can't go and get a job in a lush or whatever
S0192	just because the workload be too high then they're not allow
S0198	oh yeah what else you normally do be do
S0233	because they because they want you to spend your time do stuff that's enrich you in term of
S0198	yeah
S0234	yeah so so you should be in play in your spare time rather than
S0233	not your personal study but other things like that
S0198	ah okay yeah
S0192	interest of course you need to have the finance to support yourself though
S0233	yes so i have a career development loan
S0198	okay
S0233	which i take out and at some point it be fine but then towards the end of the year i actually do need erm not financial assistance but college i college have to be nicer to me and they give me some money to sort myself sort myself out
S0198	yeah access to learn fund
S0192	so if you do start work what inland revenue contact the university
S0233	no no basically basically
S0234	you can get throw out of the university
S0233	that wouldn't happen though there's probably just the i think the idea be that they just want you to talk it through with them in fact if i have go today to them oh i'm struggle a bite financially do you mind if i work a a few hours on a saturday at one of the shop in town they'd probably be okay with it but
S0192	i mean how can you tell people you can't work
S0198	be that the same for undergraduates as well
S0233	it's probably more strict with undergraduates
S0234	it's it's very strict with undergraduates i actually know cos i be talk to one of the erm lecturers about this and i actually know they in queen's they tell someone that they have to stop work
S0192	wow
S0233	but but the reason for that the reason for that be because undergraduates like i at and i don't know how it be at but it be ten week block
S0198	yeah yeah
S0233	their block be eight weeks and i reckon
S0234	and they also have lecture on a saturday
S0233	yes well it depend on your course it definitely seem a bite definitely like
S0234	so like scientists who do proper work
S0198	have to come in on a saturday do some lab work
S0233	my friend my friend that work there that do history say that she be have to write one essay every week
S0234	yeah
S0233	whereas i think i be write maybe three a term
S0198	yeah yeah three a semester be the standard
S0234	no that's very that's actually quite cos that's what my brother eldest brother be at for undergraduate and he didn't go to any lecture we find no he go to two lecture the whole time do you remember him tell us this
S0233	i think maybe for one of his course
S0234	for the first he turn up first like oh lecture i must go and then realise that basically no one go to the lecture and they just
S0233	cos they spend their time in the library
S0234	they're just write
S0198	hand in their paper
S0234	yeah every every er week
S0198	every week
S0192	i couldn't have get through undergraduate without work i be work immediately
S0198	oh what a job yeah yeah
S0192	three years yeah i be do do fifteen to twenty hours the whole three years
S0233	well yeah you have to wait around after i have my job interview for my job before i do you remember cos like you'd move to already
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0233	and i'd come down to sort of say hey and then we meet in and we you have to wait around outside for me whilst i go into lush cos i have my job interview there
S0198	yeah yeah i do remember that
S0233	so you have to hang around in
S0198	yeah that's not so bad
S0192	pleasant
S0198	i blend in quite well it's fine
S0233	just sit outside in
S0198	just wonder what's go on
S0233	what's go on
S0198	that's not the only lush you've work at though be it
S0233	no yeah when i be at sixth form i work at
S0198	ah that's when you use to stink of lush
S0233	yep
S0192	can you stink of lush
S0198	yeah really badly
S0233	you know how it smell when you walk past it on the high street it's like that but ten time worse
S0192	be lush sorry lush be like one of these cosmetic shop bar soap and er like a green
S0198	yeah soap and stuff
S0233	it be start by a guy call mark constantine who erm
S0234	it's
S0198	have good intentions
S0233	well he er
S0198	corporate but anyway
S0233	he be no actually they're still very political erm i'm not like their hugest fan because of some of the things they support and there's some contradictory things in their message actually
S0233	but he be a he set up the body shop with anita roddick
S0192	okay
S0233	erm and then they start go off on their own and then he do lush on his own erm but there be some issue with the body shop because they steal some lush product design so erm there be some discontent there i think
S0192	about lush
S0198	yeah
S0233	but it's kind of bad cos you know they kind of like they're very good on try to source the best things where possible that they do use certain things like palm oil and things like that that you wouldn't necessarily expect them to use
S0192	okay
S0198	yeah
S0233	so you could be depend on which but then you know comparatively to all the other crap that do have so much other stuff in it they're not that bad
S0198	they're not that bad yeah
S0192	i guess abstinence altogether i keep try to get you off every kind of makeup and soap and whatnot
S0198	yeah
S0192	just rub bake soda in your hair and i'm sure you'll be fine
S0198	you can do that apple apple or vinegar and bake soda
S0192	course you can brush your teeth with i'm sure would be great
S0198	our friend do it for a year she only last a year and good for your skin
S0192	be wear your turmeric mask
S0198	yeah make a turmeric mask it give you a ginger beard though
S0192	she go out with a yellow face yesterday i say you've not
S0233	turmeric's probably alright actually because it's not the stinkiest of
S0198	of things yeah it doesn't have a smell it's just very stain
S0192	i think it's an anti inflammatory as well
S0233	yeah it be really stain yeah and like if i've cook with it i be you always kind of have yellow finger don't you
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	it's really nice stuff though i love turmeric

S0198	he be like i don't i don't trust the oven yet so
S0192	i tell you what ingredients be different like come back home i'm cook the same things i be cook in korea but the ingredients be different yeah i need to get use to the ingredients here again cos it's all a little bite i need to tweak everything
S0198	things be actually hotter here surprisingly
S0192	yeah the chillies the chillies
S0233	hotter
S0198	be spicier yeah yeah that's
S0192	the rice the rice be different most of the basic ingredients be different courgettes in korea be like this big they're like tiny you can't stuff a courgette in england they're like really small
S0198	there be
S0192	i don't know what you'd do with it hey we do see some bigger ones than that one
S0198	yeah
S0234	ah you see so last year i grow courgettes i have quite
S0233	yeah they kinda turn we be like be these marrows or be they courgettes
S0234	some really big ones be they be they now yeah yeah it be on it be on the level
S0198	courgettes bigger
S0233	yeah no it's our garden go okay this year but i think because we be away maybe our tomato our tomato plant go crazy
S0234	have the best tomato plant this year and they die when we get back
S0233	they do so well
S0192	oh no
S0233	then they kind of outgrow where they be live
S0198	ah thrive too much yeah yeah
S0234	yeah i don't know they fell over they fell over
S0233	but we have some excellent cucumbers and it look like we've get some excellent cabbage
S0234	get yeah spring cabbage as well
S0198	wow you've get a proper patch
S0233	you know what you guy should
S0192	shall i get some cucumber out
S0233	you guy should get
S0198	oh yeah we've get some
S0233	cos we've get we have one as well but we haven't we're not use it at the moment get this thing call erm an area garden which be erm basically a well
S0234	it's hydroponic
S0233	so you could like grow some cannabis in it if you want to but erm
S0198	probably gonna leave that this year
S0233	it's really good for like herbs and
S0198	to get everything else do
S0233	oh look at this
S0234	oh think that be that be quick
S0233	wow
S0192	just get it out of the garden not too bad
S0233	to like
S0198	be it where do you do you inside still

S0234	it have its own light at night it can be a bite
S0198	right
S0234	bright yeah
S0198	yeah
S0233	yeah no they're really really good
S0234	the only problem be be they do use up quite a lot of erm electricity
S0192	electricity
S0233	oh yeah i guess so
S0234	so the best ones i'm hop someone will do it but they're erm basically you can get these lead ones now
S0198	mm oh that'd be much better
S0234	at the moment they're try to work out the best and actually lead light be better for plant
S0198	ah
S0234	so they're at the moment try to work out what the best colour be erm
S0198	to get the most successful
S0234	to get the most success and there's this guy actually in harvard who's grow like all these different plant and create a database of all this stuff it's gonna be amaze like

S0192	let's have a look
S0198	private where's the yeah i mean i take it there's more to it but
S0233	yeah so it's big enough it's big enough so that at the end we've get like where grow his plant and then when his parent
S0234	's area
S0233	his parent his parent his parent be kind of they close out their house and get rid of all their possessions they're just drive around in an rv or a motor home

S0234	both
S0233	america and england
S0198	yeah
S0233	erm
S0198	wow
S0233	so we inherit their ping pong table so we've get a ping pong table
S0192	oh brilliant
S0233	and space for a barbeque and space for the cat to have a little
S0234	where be that picture from
S0192	be you good at ping pong
S0233	yeah okay
S0198	get better
S0192	i quite like it it's a fun fun game
S0233	get better
S0198	i haven't play ping pong since ah i mean we've play it on holiday a couple of time
S0192	yeah i like ping pong
S0234	be that
S0192	koreans be amaze

S0234	i can't find a good photo unfortunately
S0233	they've get a few ping pong bar in london now but
S0192	ping pong bar
S0233	yeah
S0234	yeah it's a big thing in london at the moment
S0192	delineate for me if you will what the hell be ping pong bar
S0234	it's basically
S0233	it's basically a bar with ping pong table
S0234	it's basically it's basically yeah ping pong table because be because for everyone think that ping pong be cool so erm
S0233	there's load of free ping pong table everywhere as well at the moment
S0234	and actually i'm quite up for this like the idea of erm
S0233	have
S0234	have something to do without necessarily cos i think a lot of the time people like you know you meet someone you go what be you gonna do oh probably go to the pub
S0192	mm
S0234	or something like that whereas actually you could go oh let's go play ping pong
S0233	yeah yeah
S0198	there be more activities than the pub
S0234	you don't need to as well
S0192	korea be good for that
S0198	yeah
S0192	they have lot of dvd sorry room dvd room they have like golf screen be really cheap
S0198	there's lot of and
S0192	you pay like eight pound to play golf for four hours
S0198	yeah
S0234	oh that's awesome
S0192	you hire the whole room out you can drink in there
S0198	yeah do that exist in england
S0234	yeah
S0198	it do be it expensive
S0192	but it's not cheap
S0234	really expensive
S0198	cos it seem expensive in korea by korean standards but when you work it out it's
S0192	but it's not it's about eight pound each for like nine hole and when you're crap nine hole take about four hours so
S0198	four hours but you can take your own beer in and everything
S0192	yeah they provide ice cream and whatever else the service be pretty good there
S0233	sound good
S0192	so they have that in korea they have like pool house and
S0198	yeah it's good to go out and have more stuff to do than just
S0192	there's mean to be some music bar around somewhere i never saw one where they just have instrument out and you can just go in and pick the drum or like pick up a guitar
S0234	yeah that's
S0233	london definitely need a bite more of that i think london's a bite still a bite too focus on just bar
S0234	maybe we should start a thing like that
S0192	i think towns
S0198	run your own business
S0233	you can be our consultant cos you know how it's do
S0234	yeah you could just
S0192	i feel like town
S0234	we'll just pay you just to say things
S0198	we'll give you some freebies that would go on
S0192	town town centre i think need to be erm
S0233	it's true you've already get it right just start charge people five pound to come in
S0198	not in my house
S0192	i don't know about you guy but when i go to a town centre there's like nothing to do i don't care about phone shop i don't care about wh smiths and these kind of things
S0198	yeah you're gonna
S0192	i wish town centre be more interactive and be more like place you go in and you know make stuff and build stuff and get pay to go and do stuff
S0234	yeah exactly exactly
S0192	not just do you wanna buy this no not really
S0198	i hate high streets
S0192	yeah
S0233	well that's why high streets struggle
S0198	most high streets anyway
S0192	we're pretty frugal so
S0198	high street have you be there lately you know a place be bad when there's just there's four pound shop
S0198	a primark mark and spencer's have to get shut down cos you know people aren't shop there
S0233	yeah it's a really bad mark and spencer's anyway erm
S0198	i think it's go
S0233	no i have some colleagues who have to go down to the dockyards
S0198	oh yeah
S0233	and erm i tell them i say for lunch if you can't eat at the dockyards if they're close or whatever cos i think it be out of season or something eat at the shop centre next to the dockyards or at the pub you know the one next to the odeon
S0198	okay yeah yeah yeah
S0233	and instead they be like oh no we'll go into the centre of
S0198	oh no no no
S0233	and they end up eat at the weird café at the top of alders
S0198	yeah yeah
S0233	and say it be disgust
S0198	ah yeah
S0233	i be like well
S0234	i tell you

S0198	anyone
S0233	yeah but that's what i'm try to say subway be probably your best option
S0192	it's safer yeah
S0198	it's it's your safest bet in for sure
S0192	i wonder well
S0198	the chinese be
S0192	there's get to be lot of good little sandwich shop around haven't there it's england
S0198	not really in

S0192	and the bus station there's horrible
S0233	yeah bus station and
S0192	do you meet mad
S0233	no no it be probably too cold in a snow start snow storm for mad i think he'd probably go to shelter
S0192	he'd be in somewhere yeah
S0233	in somewhere else erm
S0234	i've never hear this story before
S0233	so i have to get and then i just have to wait
S0234	i think i know all your stories
S0233	to get back on the bus to so that be my time in
S0198	ah that be your encounter
S0233	so that be my one time in
S0192	well you didn't get stab so not too bad
S0198	we be erm when we be look to rent somewhere here well first of all we come across a scam like if you'd notice it
S0233	oh on gumtree or whatever
S0192	yeah load of scam apartments
S0234	it's weird
S0198	under different name but you can tell the language be all kind of similar we we like hit a few of them at the same time and get back very similar email with the same
S0192	really hopeful like oh that's a
S0198	like very be a native speaker but not quite like make some errors
S0233	be they ask you to pay money to view and things like that or anything
S0198	well they jump on that fact
S0192	we hadn't get that far
S0198	that we be abroad so we be try to discuss how we could secure an apartment with them could we arrange a view and they be quick quick to come back go oh no just send me this amount of money and you can secure it and they give a long spiel about them be christian and how you know
S0192	all sort of
S0198	they want you to keep a godly home and keep it clean for them but erm you run her name through the database
S0192	yeah i search her
S0198	mrs whatever
S0192	email address and be like mm scam
S0198	it's a scam scam
S0192	but i mean how can this same email address have be scamming people on gumtree for years but it's still happen i don't know
S0234	er no so i be read about this apparently what they're do in and the reason it's break english apparently they can also speak english very very well these people
S0198	mm
S0192	mm
S0234	they're try to get someone gullible enough to fall for it because they're only interest in people that be gonna give them the money
S0198	give them the cash yeah
S0192	oh yeah absolutely
S0234	it's a filter mechanism of of basically work out who's stupid
S0198	oh who be gonna be yeah yeah
S0234	who isn't pick up all these obvious sign
S0198	sign yeah
S0234	so then then they have to spend time email
S0192	i just don't understand how it's a know scam yet gumtree doesn't take it down
S0234	oh so i email gumtree about one of them
S0192	yeah
S0234	when er i find out about it but yeah they don't they just
S0233	cos yeah when we
S0234	there's just too many of them
S0233	when we our flat we have to it be really difficult to get a flat wasn't it in london
S0234	that be actually one of the ones in when me and be
S0233	oh right be it
S0192	wasn't too easy either
S0198	no yeah
S0192	come and go like that
S0198	so these ones sort of look reasonable but of course they be all fake
S0234	but i be gonna say that i imagine that be similar to london
S0192	yeah
S0234	in a sense and cos when we be look to rent in london it be just it be literally like you have to
S0233	you need to have your deposit cheque with you
S0234	you have to sort of go right i'll take it
S0198	yeah yeah you've get
S0192	yeah yeah i read an article that say be second to london in the country for like
S0198	for get properties and try to get a property
S0192	and it be really stressful for us
S0198	it be stressful from abroad cos you'd see it come up that day and we be on a we be on the opposite time zone so when they open we'd finish work like like that nine hour difference be really annoy
S0192	mm then they have the stipulation that you you must see it somebody have to see it so we have to get 's parent down and then there's the stress of like
S0198	someone have to
S0233	oh right so your parent have to come and
S0192	they saw this one just one
S0198	yeah
S0233	and your mum say it's fine
S0198	it's fine yeah yeah
S0192	then we have the bullshit i honestly think we'd save you know like fifteen grand each or something i think when we come home obviously most of that's go now on tuition and rent and all that kind of stuff but i think have that kind of money they'd just turn around and be like yeah we'll take you great i i can pay the whole year up front no worry all this kind of stuff no not at all it be actually a hell of a lot of rigmarole
S0198	yeah we have to pay for an external company to
S0192	to reference us which be really difficult to do
S0234	oh
S0198	and we have to deal with them directly
S0233	i wonder
S0198	our agency just give us their detail
S0192	so they're tell can you send us bill i don't pay bill well what's your i don't you know my address it' s all in korea
S0233	it's because you've just move back isn't it yeah
S0198	well we be do this from
S0192	well we be still in korea
S0198	korea
S0192	so we have to get our boss who don't speak amaze english to fill out all this paperwork say that yes we do live here yes they do pay our bill and they pay all this it be really stressful
S0198	it be annoy because
S0192	they want like bank statements we don't get bank statements we don't have them
S0198	it be stupid
S0234	ah see when we we move into the london one as soon as we pay six months in advance because i didn't have a job
S0192	yeah
S0234	and i know that we wouldn't pass the credit check
S0233	actually yeah that be wasn't it the check
S0234	because i didn't have i have enough money to pay it's like you basically i could have pay a year in advance so i just say look if i pay six months in advance
S0233	be that fine
S0234	be that fine
S0233	cos it's a six month contract anyway isn't it
S0234	and they didn't and they didn't
S0198	yeah that's exactly what we say isn't it
S0192	but we be tell them that i say i'll pay you six months i'll pay a year and she basically say that
S0198	i think it's because we be abroad
S0192	yeah i think so they didn't trust us yeah they want to make sure we be legitimate
S0198	regardless of whether we transfer them the money or not but that
S0192	now we've still pay them six months up front because actually we fail the reference check which really stress us out cos it take two weeks of every day email contact ring try to get paperwork i finally get it alright and then something's wrong with it so i have to do something it be really laborious and then erm yeah they just tell us they fail us so now we have to get guarantors and and we're worry about 's parent you know her dad's retire her mum's not on that much money like be they gonna pass you know what i mean erm so i appeal it and find out that the reason that we fail be because we have the save in our account and we have enough save but we'd be in cambodia for a few weeks before now i don't keep all my save in the account that i travel on it's not a good idea so i move it into a digital account and then when i get back into korea i move it back in all they saw be that i move the money back into my account and the money hadn't be in my account long enough so they didn't trust it
S0234	ah
S0192	so i have to i mean they could have just tell me
S0198	they have bank statements date back for six months they just have to look at the other statements
S0192	they just didn't look there so i have to appeal that and that take another week
S0233	anyway you're here now
S0234	oh my god
S0198	yeah yeah
S0233	well now that you're here it's fine
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah it's good
S0192	oh
S0234	that sound absolutely ridiculous
S0192	it be a pain in the arse
S0198	it be it be silly it be just lot of silliness
S0192	i go in the library the other day i think they be gonna credit check me just to rent out a book it's ridiculous
S0192	they tell me i go in on my own i want to
S0198	which library
S0192	print something
S0198	oh in bedford
S0192	they say do you have a library card i say no i don't my mum do no no you can't do it i be like can i do it on my mum's no no you can't do it on your mum's she can do it if it's for her but if it's something for you she can't do it for you you have to get your own library card i couldn't believe it when i get back to the country stipulations here be
S0234	yeah i i need i've forget something like age ago in cambridge when i be like ah no i need to print this off and i be like oh go into library and i you have to it's ridiculous right it's just like all i wanna do i'm never gonna come back here i promise you
S0192	i just want to
S0234	print that's it and but she be really nice and she be just like i'm really sorry but this be what you have to do
S0192	yeah yeah turn out this lady be actually my high school librarian
S0198	oh
S0192	she recognise me i kind of you know vaguely think i recognise her but she recognise me
S0198	and she still didn't let you do it
S0192	no i still well i get my mum to come in
S0192	she do it on her card her
S0198	mum
S0192	basically i tell her look i haven't live in the country for six years i'm not actually gonna live here so what sign up for this library card sir
S0192	one of many
S0198	ah yeah wanna have a library card
S0233	there be definitely i think erm cos you know how boot if you bring your memory stick in you can just print off the photos that be on it
S0192	yeah
S0233	there's definitely a vend machine that should be like that for print
S0192	some of those
S0233	like last minute emergency print
S0198	yeah yeah
S0234	see this be the second business idea we've have today
S0233	i guess you've get like mailboxes in korea don't you
S0198	mailboxes
S0192	mm
S0233	you know mailboxes i think that's what they do don't they
S0234	oh do they
S0233	like if you give them your usb and they'd say okay that'll be one pound please or something
S0192	personally i think we have the capacity to become almost completely paperless at the minute i don't think we even need to print anything if people just accept things more by email a lot
S0233	my library hurdle be encounter at the british library because you need to have erm hard copy of your things that prove you be who you be
S0192	mm
S0233	so obviously have my pass have my provisional drive licence but then it be stuff like the bank statements and stuff and my employer doesn't have my address and so i have to try and prove my address and i haven't really have to do that
S0192	no
S0233	so i have to go away and wait until natwest could send me some hard copy bank statements cos you're not allow to print off online versions
S0192	no
S0198	yeah yeah it doesn't count
S0233	so i be like
S0234	yeah that's the that it really i think it's a real big problem actually because
S0198	yeah cos everyone's go paperless
S0234	all our electricity you know cos obviously look yeah i don't need to see the bill
S0192	no
S0234	like in in my hand i can i can see it online
S0198	online account that's the whole purpose of it
S0234	and then they're like well and then they're like well do you have a utility bill and i'm like yeah it's online i can show it to you but they're like no we need it print in front of and i'm like
S0192	why
S0234	well i could just go to a printer probably print it on decent quality paper and how can you tell that it's not come from the utility
S0192	no you can't
S0198	yeah they're just make you jump through a stupid hoop
S0233	yeah that
S0192	we have some serious hoop when we go to teach abroad they make us like all of our degrees have to be apostilled and all this kind of stuff our certificate we have to
S0198	send us because people do
S0192	criminal record check get them apostilled but it's bullshit though because you go to a solicitor's a solicitor sign say this be a real copy of something that they haven't see they never ring up the union to verify it they just sign yes it be a copy of whatever he just show me and then you have to take that to somewhere in milton keynes to be apostilled yes he's a real solicitor that really do sign so basically it's just some solicitor's signature for that mean nothing
S0198	yeah five quid
S0192	but it cost us every time every time we go away and then transcripts have to be directly send from the uni to wherever we're work you can't just
S0198	oh do they oh
S0192	yeah we have to get them send directly to
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	and it go out before we couldn't
S0198	and they have to be within the last six months
S0192	yeah
S0198	regardless of when we graduate
S0192	yeah cos your degree go out of date doesn't it so you have to
S0198	so we have to apply for them all the time
S0192	it cost us about three hundred quid in paperwork every time we wanna go away pretty much
S0233	that's rubbish
S0192	ridiculous
S0198	yeah whatever
S0192	it's fine
S0198	just smile
S0192	they pay us we enough so it's not too bad
S0192	our old fourteen fourteen grand a year basically impoverish aren't we
S0198	yeah have you hear about these food bank
S0233	yeah
S0198	they're become more common we hear we hear about them through our american friends they saw something
S0192	we didn't believe them yeah
S0198	at like an expo thing on american news about britain and
S0233	yeah
S0198	our state of poverty because of these er bank
S0233	oh erm
S0198	but i didn't think they be that common so i don't know if they're american media be get a bite excite
S0233	yeah we have the
S0198	this sound good
S0233	outside our sainsbury's we have the food bank that come in like every other sunday or something and they it's not just in our area but like the whole the whole of the borough
S0198	oh okay yeah yeah yeah
S0192	you're not a food obviously
S0234	no
S0233	so then they just ask for
S0234	thank god
S0233	food donations for when we come out
S0198	okay yeah you can just donate add it to your basket at one actually
S0233	but yeah i don't think there's be a drastic rise
S0198	no
S0192	no
S0233	that's always
S0192	it's just always be there yeah
S0198	it's just another alternative thing
S0192	do you remember when
S0198	be it new
S0192	we have a friend that work a like a coffee shop or something he get sack cos he give an old sandwich away to a tramp or something
S0198	mm
S0192	yeah but their sandwich be out of date
S0234	i mean the ridiculous thing i use to have
S0233	be that a health and safety thing then
S0198	yeah it's probably like starbucks could then be liable for food like the tramp
S0192	be a tramp gonna sue i mean
S0233	well yeah because he want to get rich
S0234	yeah that's like the the way tramp get out of poverty
S0192	oh be it
S0233	yeah
S0233	give them out of date food
S0234	so they go round hop that someone's gonna an out of date that's why they're that's why they're beg for food
S0192	trip on crack in the pavement call up the council
S0198	yeah
S0234	do you know what if they i bet there's probably someone out there that's do it
S0192	a clever tramp
S0198	yeah
S0192	definitely
S0234	he he wouldn't be a tramp
S0192	he won't be a tramp for long
S0198	yeah yeah he's not a tramp
S0234	he's not a tramp he's just a pretend tramp
S0233	no but there be the whole thing in london about erm
S0198	get a bite politically incorrect
S0233	this this this guy in i think it be in fulham or somewhere that have like a really nice house that be pretend to be a tramp
S0233	and he be make a lot of money
S0234	yeah he be
S0198	just just like beg
S0234	the the buskers in
S0198	oh yeah
S0234	on the underground
S0233	yeah they're fine
S0234	they're one of them's a millionaire
S0233	really
S0234	yeah
S0192	what you'd think at that point you'd stop do you know what i mean
S0234	i mean he's a millionaire because the house he buy
S0192	oh he have equity
S0233	oh right that's kinda different
S0234	he's not actually get well it's not
S0233	but he still
S0234	if he sell his house
S0233	however he still own his house that's pretty wealthy
S0234	yeah
S0192	i mean yeah if he's get a million whether or not it's tie up i don't care
S0198	how long be your mortgage for like how
S0234	thirty years
S0233	until we die
S0198	thirty years ah make
S0192	well you've do you've do the first of the three ms
S0198	but obviously you remortgage and you move
S0192	you've get mortgage marriage be come and then there's just maternity after
S0234	oh
S0234	i be gonna i be try to work out how
S0198	it's murder
S0233	it's murder
S0192	that's the fourth and final m do you guy want children
S0233	yep
S0198	mm i remember you say last time you be here
S0192	he sound so sure
S0198	that be quick on 's part
S0233	we've we've decide like one i think
S0234	yeah definitely don't want siblings
S0233	they're expensive
S0234	yeah like
S0233	go on holiday with and siblings fight cos i grow up as an only child so i don't didn't really realise that siblings i mean any siblings fight
S0192	they definitely fight
S0233	but
S0192	to the extent that they
S0233	yeah to the extent that they can be really really mean
S0198	ah have that put you off
S0233	but that's like
S0198	be pick on again
S0233	they wind each other up
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	we've think about adopt haven't we
S0198	how old be
S0233	ten
S0198	ah really do she look a lot like still do it freak you out
S0234	i don't think she look like i think you she look like a probably think she look like cos i think she look like when be younger
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	a younger and 's thirteen
S0233	twelve
S0198	twelve
S0233	go to year eight
S0198	yeah do he like
S0233	yeah
S0198	he do
S0233	yeah i think so
S0198	's go there next year
S0192	and school's compulsory now until eighteen isn't it
S0233	yeah he say they've erm mm we he's
S0234	be that true
S0233	it's quite a big school isn't it
S0192	i don't know you've live here longer than i
S0234	don't tell me stuff i don't know
S0192	that's what that's what i hear yeah
S0233	well it's obviously chapter in
S0192	it's compulsory until eighteen
S0233	erm i think
S0234	that can't be right
S0192	apparently so
S0234	though
S0192	apparently there be like colleges be the country get a lot more people now like i have friends that have be kind of kind of through the back door into colleges because apparently there's be a rise i think it's this year or last year get a lot more people come know more about it than i do but
S0234	but that whole erm what do you call it when you do er apprentice
S0192	yeah okay baccalaureate sort of thing
S0234	i wonder whether they they're just try to now do it so you can maybe you can stay like you don't have to stay in school or join an official apprentice programme
S0192	yeah perhaps there's one or the other but you have to do something personally i don't see a problem with finish school maybe maybe eighteen i don't think you should go to university immediately
S0234	no no
S0192	i think you shouldn't be able to go to uni at least until you're twenty one i think that's it's too big a debt to hand people obviously some people their parent pay for it or they get bursaries and grant that kind of stuff but for the majority of people to say that at the age of seventeen you're no adult who can't be try under the justice system effectively but then a day after your eighteenth birthday here's a fifty thousand pound loan for the rest of your life that you're just sign up to i think that's too big a decision to make at the age of eighteen i think you should give it three years of work travel whatever you need to do and then it might mean that certain people don't go to university because and other people that wouldn't have do now because they're i think they would change it i would i honestly i think about it quite a bite but i think twenty one should be the minimum age
S0234	ah i mean i think it's i the biggest problem be the raise of fee which be just a big mistake
S0192	yeah it really be go the american style as oppose to european style i mean we we really want to study in erm one of our major choices be the university of in the netherlands
S0234	the netherlands yeah yeah
S0192	top hundred world university teach in english do the course we wanna do tuition fee a thousand pound a year not six thousand pound a year cost of live equitable slightly less maybe couldn't do it i apply to numerous job around the around the world and they be tell me no your master's degree must be from a native english speak country so it have to be from one of the five or six native can't be from doesn't matter it a top hundred uni do matter that they teach in english doesn't matter that they're basically bilingual and then
S0234	hopefully yeah the netherlands be like the best non native speak english people i think
S0192	you think it would be allow wouldn't you
S0234	yeah
S0192	i think for if we do a phd we'd like to try and do it in the state or in canada erm they seem to have a little bite more fund out there
S0234	oh oh i will say
S0192	you can get it
S0234	you can do teach during your phd
S0192	yes
S0234	as well
S0192	as an adjust professor yeah erm so basically we and we kinda wanna get dual citizenship with a slightly larger country at some point so maybe get our foot in the door in america or in canada or
S0234	that's yeah that's a good idea
S0192	ideally i'd like to live in argentina but i don't think they're gonna me too much not so easy tertiary education system be not quite as good out there at the moment korean be terrible i mean most people in england seem to know that korea have a really good education system or at least so i hear it's like second in the world sometimes
S0234	well i know like the one i know be mostly singapore
S0192	yes
S0234	and that school right level be more than i mean i know the university's mean to be reasonable but
S0192	i mean korean's i'm not gonna lie like at you know middle school they're do some pretty complicate mathematical equations that we would still be do with a calculator at like probably lower university maybe even up i i don't know i still i really don't know but it be beyond what i be do then it be pretty complicate stuff however learning's really good and kind of creative think none whatsoever none and they work them to death and like ninety five percent of the country go to university so it have the same population as england and it's roughly equitable size as well but they have more than double the amount of universities that we have they've get over three hundred and fifty unis in the country so the education system there mostly wrong i think just strange that most people at least i meet in the west kinda think it have a really good education system i think it's terrible
S0234	well there's i mean we so there be a thing that come out actually in the news about how england there's a table of education
S0192	oh just recently we're like eleventh or something
S0234	yeah yeah we be quite low down like we drop a place or two i think
S0192	finland first
S0234	yeah
S0192	they work less hours they have less homework they go to school when they're older i really it's gonna be difficult for me to have different ideas about you know the education system but have to work in education within the system for the whole i honestly believe that education should be a lifelong process you know you're not grade c at sixteen and then you carry this grade with you for the rest of your life and you can't change a lot of people seem to you know they'll do as well roughly as what they be tell they be gonna do at like sixteen i have friends that be like sixteen they be tell they be a c or a d grade student and they carry that forever and they're kinda like you know no i'm dyslexic i've get this i can't do that and i can't do this so i'm just
S0234	oh no i know i always say to people i could get anyone an a star in mathematics
S0192	yeah
S0234	easily
S0192	i'm sure you could
S0234	one one on one tutor
S0192	we're all human right we have the capacity to understand these
S0234	also it's not that hard it really isn't i mean
S0192	most people just shy away from it because it have you know a reputation for be like that i'm not gonna like i'm not particularly mathematically incline but when i do maths at school i do fine in it it wasn't a problem i just find it bore it
S0234	it be erm for the it be bore
S0192	it's not applicable there's no what do you do with it you're like well i can do some basic division yeah and some basic add but what do i need the rest for
S0234	well it's cos it's cool
S0192	just yeah it's cool to have it
S0234	no but it i mean if you and that's the other thing i find with it it's they don't teach you all the interest mathematics
S0192	no okay
S0234	and they don't teach you like everyone know pythagoras' theorem but they don't really understand why it's ridiculous erm how it be have be know for like a really long time
S0192	yeah
S0234	and that sort of get your interest and think like so this really really far back who be think about you know triangles then and why be he think about triangles and what's special about triangles
S0192	obviously
S0234	the deeper mean of mathematics rather than just oh i need to know the a square plus b square equal c square
S0192	just to pass it
S0234	to come and pass the test
S0192	yeah yeah we just need a complete revamp of how i mean maybe teachers be better nowadays than they be when we be in school but i certainly know that how and i teach english isn't how french be be teach to us at school not at all methodology's move on a lot since then
S0234	mm well i mean i know i know a lot of people at who be in the education department in fact one of the guy who be the president of the mcr when i be the secretary erm he he go around the world and be a speaker in education i've no idea what why he's go around but he's australian so oh actually he's from new zealand but he's he basically do a lot with the education in our australia and they have meet like i think it seem like they're try to move education what it probably use where it's like i think before at least when i be grow up and then probably before that it be a case of this be what we use this be how we use to teach you know your dad be teach like this so now we're gonna teach like this
S0192	mm
S0234	whereas now it seem like they're try to break the
S0192	very restrictive learn
S0234	yeah they're try to all these of try to learn how to teach people which sometimes i question
S0192	yeah no of course yeah
S0234	it doesn't like they've apparently they've stop teach long division
S0192	mm
S0234	so they're now do another way of divide big number
S0192	ah interest
S0234	not the standard long division where you you know you start
S0192	be it more efficient
S0234	it's mean to be a lot more efficient but
S0192	progress
S0234	it's incredibly complicate
S0192	oh okay
S0234	to try and get your head it doesn't seem logical i think
S0192	well minimalism be an important thing for learners i'm read a book about analyse english sort of like syntactic theory like chomsky's syntactic theory like chomsky's transformational grammar and stuff and one of the main components of make their parametric theory be like erm minimalism basically make it as simple as possible so that if it's ever apply to people you can learn it easy you shouldn't be make these things overly complex but it should be look for the simplest way of do something the quickest and simplest
S0234	but but that's what i mean be be that the simplest one be the quickest the quickest be not always the simplest
S0192	no not necessarily i guess you have to take a way which one be it
S0234	yeah it's interest
S0198	oh wow
S0233	and i'd like school if or even sport cos i actually quite like sport now
S0198	yeah yeah no class when i be fourteen
S0233	it be disgust it wasn't just the fact pe teachers it be the other
S0198	yeah
S0233	the really bad change facilities like really gross now i think they have like hair dryers and hair straighteners and stuff and things like that i be like
S0198	i stop i didn't enjoy it at all i be too conscious it be not
S0233	and there wasn't anything to do it be like now now they do basically we do like dance which be basically all the girls i hat dance routine
S0198	yeah yeah
S0233	or rounders which be okay and that's about it girls never do football
S0198	no we never get to play football
S0233	i remember we have like some shitty just uninspiring whereas now i think they offer them things like yoga and
S0198	yeah emphasis on do sport really same with languages system of teach languages like don't know about but be horrible
S0233	i think best person to ask would probably be
S0198	yeah i know
S0198	where will go be she about to take her eleven plus
S0198	cucumber really the back of my throat
S0233	basically couple of the practice test and she's borderline
S0198	okay
S0233	mum basically say that she think she like daydream a lot
S0198	yeah
S0233	she's not very focus
S0198	okay
S0233	it's not that she's not smart enough it's just
S0198	no i'm sure she'll be alright wherever she go
S0233	i think she'll realise though because she's get a friend that's like oh be you go to go to or something
S0198	wow she's texting at ten
S0233	she's on a contract communicate with him separate
S0198	okay
S0233	so i be use 's phone for the time we be out there something like that maybe pull her sock up she will be do exams but whether she get above the mark don't think she'd get a place at
S0198	no yeah
S0233	might squeeze into somewhere like
S0198	be it more competitive there very competitive
S0233	competitive
S0198	so they go by your grade
S0233	i think like you pick your top choices and then the school decide how they want
S0198	oh wow
S0233	at they'll probably just go down the list place we'll take the top one hundred that say they want to come here
S0198	yeah didn't think about

S0233	you go
S0198	so you might need a man with a boat then
S0233	i would i would i would learn to sail very quickly if i have a boat

S0198	san francisco
S0192	do up this boat buy a crappy boat do it up sail all the way down the coast of america to we just miss them in el salvador so we be kind of in the same area they then sail from central america to new zealand

S0198	on this boat they do up themselves
S0192	across the pacific take them months
S0198	it be a big boat
S0192	stop off in tiny little islands
S0198	they're crazy
S0192	they've now just set off from new zealand again back over the pacific and they stay in new zealand for like a year year and a half or something just chill just like whatever can you imagine sail across the pacific
S0234	how do you how do you do that though in term of visa though
S0198	oh i don't know
S0192	yeah i don't know i don't know they do a lot of preparation they've keep be keep blog like follow them as they go and all this kind of thing
S0198	preparation they spend a couple of years in the state prepare for it but they have to yeah one of them have i think they both enrol in college course at some point how to maintain a boat and
S0192	yeah
S0198	to do stuff like that
S0192	all this kind of stuff they take it pretty seriously but i mean it's amaze isn't it
S0234	that's awesome
S0192	to sail across the pacific stop off at random polynesia micronesia or wherever
S0198	i wouldn't be able to do it though i don't like the sea that enough to do that to set sail on it in anything that wasn't wasn't control
S0192	you're not amaze with open water be you
S0198	no i'd be on a life jacket all day
S0233	we've get we've get quite a few boaty friends but that's because of the private schoolyness isn't it
S0234	yeah
S0192	the rah
S0198	yeah
S0192	my brother say that about go to erm bath he's go to canterbury i just tell er but he be gonna go to he get into bath as well but he go there and he be just like the people that i meet at bath compare to canterbury he say i just wouldn't fit in in bath i just wouldn't feel comfortable there
S0198	he wasn't comfortable
S0192	that's fair it's quite rary especially in bath i only ever meet foreign students from i never actually meet
S0198	they didn't speak to us that's why
S0192	yeah probably
S0198	they know we be from
S0192	from bath oh come on the two unis never do the same subject you might as well just make one big uni i don't
S0198	that would have be great for us
S0192	bath spa would be the sister college of arts or whatever
S0198	you just say i go to uni in bath
S0192	yeah we just say that
S0198	don't have to be specific
S0192	it's not good when you're work
S0198	i've get some great aunt and uncle somewhere that think i go to bath university
S0192	it's terrible when you're live abroad though cos they don't really know the uni so they're like you you go to university at a bath
S0198	a bath
S0192	a bath a spa a spa a bath
S0198	be it spa and university
S0192	and now probably they'll be like sex
S0192	sex
S0234	massage
S0198	no
S0234	i do not know that exist until this moment so
S0198	well there you go
S0192	never hear of it seventieth in the country
S0192	half way
S0234	use to play hockey at the uni er occasionally
S0198	in
S0234	mm
S0192	it's actually really pretty like the campus be really nice and it only have about five thousand students so it literally can't be any higher in the in the rank i don't think it doesn't have enough facilities it doesn't have enough fund
S0234	where where be it in be it
S0192	on the way to on the outskirts
S0198	it's on yeah
S0192	really nice you can't like it's all conservation and list you can't like build anything on it or anything
S0198	prince of wales own it or something
S0192	it's really pretty but
S0233	do you know about the georgian swim pool that's in bath
S0192	no
S0233	it's one of the oldest outdoor swim pool in the uk and the heritage lottery fund have just give it a grant to do itself up cos it's all grow grow over and everything
S0198	no yeah
S0233	cos it go out of use in the seventies
S0198	oh that's why yeah we would have hear of
S0192	do you know we have the oldest cinema in
S0198	where abouts be it do you know in bath
S0233	it's erm i'm not sure exactly where but i think
S0198	i wonder where it'd be
S0192	have you hear that the oldest cinema be in duke of york or something or duke of something
S0233	yeah erm i'm
S0234	you'll
S0233	yeah again we have this programme at work which be call young root which be where young people have to drive the heritage project so they've gotta be erm sixteen to twenty five and they've get to choose their heritage topic and then work with a partner organisation
S0192	mm
S0233	so they're work with erm the partner organisation be a charity base in call which encourage creative writers to enter their work and provide write workshops for people and stuff like that and they be run a project call which i'm have to monitor call have a blast in
S0233	so it may come your way soon but essentially they're go around and then research the erm cinema the theatre the pier
S0192	oh brilliant
S0233	cinema history and they're gonna do walk tour and audio post erm in the city
S0198	oh yeah
S0233	so you'll be able to hear stories about 's entertainment history
S0198	mm it's gonna have colourful history isn't it
S0192	sound good
S0233	yeah yeah i mean it's it's gonna be alright
S0192	colourful's a good way of put it
S0233	not quite sure how high quality it's will be it's more about just kind of get people to kind of however the other project
S0198	interact or
S0192	the quality's okay sixteen to twenty five
S0233	skills cos they're gonna and it's not just like heritage and research skills
S0198	be that what you do at work you know guy we're gonna go out today and
S0233	well they
S0234	they
S0233	that that programme be really undersubscribed so if we get a project where it's potentially good it's get an easier time of get money than a lot of the other ones where it have to be a bite more substantial
S0234	so what you're say be you need to find if you wanna get money for heritage find
S0233	find a group of kid
S0234	find find a group of kid
S0233	find a group of kid and er get to tell them what they've get to do
S0198	to support stuff yeah
S0192	what be it you do exactly
S0233	i'm a grant officer for one of the lottery distributors
S0192	brilliant
S0233	if you go to a museum a park we even fund cemeteries and see the little lottery logo
S0198	yeah yeah
S0233	and we've award some money there
S0192	okay do also to sport facilities and that kind of stuff
S0233	er no that's the big lottery fund
S0192	okay that's separate
S0233	so i just do heritage and kind of arts kind of cultural stuff erm and then the big lottery fund do things like
S0198	so you're the cultural side of it
S0234	sport centre
S0233	sport and they also do things erm cos the whole point about lottery be it's not suppose to displace core service
S0192	okay
S0233	but say they also run health grant so rather than treatment centre what they'll do be they'll have therapy centre so for cancer sufferers they'll have like massage clinics and things like that which be just sort of
S0198	okay
S0233	bring together kind of different group of people to sort of
S0192	it's all positive
S0233	help share positive energy and therapy and stuff that you don't get on the nhs
S0192	see i don't really understand i don't know how much the winnings be nowadays on the lottery but let's say you win the jackpot just you it's five million
S0233	mm mm
S0192	how much of that then go to this lottery fund
S0233	erm so the prize money be a separate thing so the the better way to think about it be the
S0234	the two pound that you for your ticket
S0233	the two pound that you pay for a ticket of that
S0192	it's two pound now
S0198	yeah yeah it's two pound a line
S0192	what
S0233	but you get enter into a raffle
S0192	it be a quid wasn't it
S0234	yeah
S0198	yeah time change
S0233	you get you get you get enter into a raffle as well at the same time
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah you do
S0192	oh so you get a bonus yeah
S0198	you get enter into a raffle which you don't win
S0192	so effectively this be
S0234	which which be like harder to win than the main main prize draw
S0192	so you pay two pound on the ticket
S0198	and what percentage go where
S0233	twenty five percent go to the lottery fund distributors which include arts council heritage lottery fund big lottery fund sport england and maybe someone else i'm forget it also use to be the money the money use to go to the olympics as well but now that's finish the rest of the money's go back into the pot and then that twenty five percent be split across those organisations
S0198	between all of those areas
S0192	so you don't have the option of just pay a pound fifty you have to pay for this tax or what effectively
S0198	that be quite a lot actually that's quite a lot of organise
S0192	it's a tax isn't it they're just build a
S0198	i mean they be do that with previous money anyway
S0192	i know but i always just find it weird where's this money come from
S0198	where's the rest of the money go
S0192	surely the winner be think hang on a minute that's my winnings
S0198	the other seventy five percent
S0192	you know what i mean i win
S0233	and operate cost
S0198	okay
S0192	it's just a stupid tax
S0198	lancelot
S0233	i mean
S0198	gwenevere or whatever their name be
S0192	isn't that
S0234	camelot
S0198	camelot that make lancelot
S0192	matilda no what be i think of
S0198	robin hood
S0192	robot war that's it
S0198	oh right yeah
S0233	but yeah it's i mean yeah people have obviously yeah
S0198	matilda
S0234	i'm so annoy that go off cos i would totally have build a robot
S0192	yeah if you be just a bite older when it be on yeah
S0198	what and to compete with it yeah you do get compete er colleges on there didn't you as well
S0233	yeah you do
S0192	i use to love robot war i think that be great i think the last time i watch it they make it crazy like some really big one it be like they have a juggernaut or something i don't know
S0234	a juggernaut
S0192	i don't know i
S0234	i can't remember what the really scary one be mean to be call as well like it just only come on occasionally
S0192	yeah
S0234	and it have like it be this humungous it wasn't very good though
S0234	and i think
S0192	too slow
S0233	i can only remember matilda
S0234	it go it get ruin by the ones that come along and start flip and things
S0198	yeah
S0233	or no no no sergeant bash
S0192	sergeant something or other
S0234	sergeant bash yeah
S0198	just do that be that one
S0233	they all do that that and they
S0198	oh do they i keep think
S0233	no and then they bring the saw out do you remember the saw
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	and it be do by that
S0198	the flame thrower
S0233	the flame thrower
S0234	the flame thrower yeah no that be the big one
S0198	maybe that's what i'm think of
S0192	oh yeah yeah yeah wasn't it host by that crack head from red dwarf
S0233	craig charles
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0234	craig charles
S0233	craig charles who be a successful funk and soul dj on radio six music and various club nights
S0192	he be a crack head wasn't he
S0233	yeah he's actually quite a good dj yeah
S0198	oh really
S0192	yeah
S0234	he's actually quite a good dj
S0198	be he still on coronation street
S0192	be he still on crack i think
S0198	make that mistake doesn't matter
S0233	doesn't matter if he's a dj
S0192	yeah
S0233	if he's a children orientate tv presenter then may not
S0192	that's a problem yeah
S0198	yeah that's the danger zone in general these days isn't it
S0233	which be why he's probably like yeah you know what i'm gonna keep my habit to myself but be a successful dj much more sensible
S0192	so the moral of the story be crack's alright just don't be around children
S0233	just don't do it to toddlers
S0198	and baby
S0234	i think that's a good moral
S0192	yeah definitely
S0198	yeah i think so
S0192	well we need children free park then don't we can go and smoke our crack our crack in it without worry about children
S0233	adult park yeah adult delinquent park
S0192	yeah definitely
S0233	that's no cos that would attract things like dog surely
S0192	well we can have
S0234	you know what we
S0192	we can have specific specific dog park
S0198	see where your mind go
S0198	just try to think of the worst things possible
S0234	i didn't tell you this but when i be go home to
S0233	no don't tell me about dog in
S0198	oh oh
S0234	i be come over and there be these two cars park but they have their light on and as soon as they saw me they switch their light off and i be like that's a bite
S0233	no it's not
S0234	it's probably drug deal i would
S0198	no
S0234	it's not so close enough so it's probably yeah
S0192	dog be when you watch other people right
S0234	yeah
S0192	you park up in cars and then you just
S0234	you have sex in the car but then then you

S0198	yeah yeah yeah that's better
S0233	yeah
S0192	if you really want to
S0198	we've have some job interview over skype
S0192	ah terrible
S0198	they're always horrible
S0234	oh yeah
S0192	have your job interview on skype
S0198	so awkward
S0192	especially when it's for the both of you
S0198	yeah
S0192	just really hard
S0198	yeah like and also because you're not face to face though i remember that one that really test our grammar and we fail
S0192	yeah
S0198	i just remember i think i just start like lean like try to go off screen slightly
S0233	start run away
S0198	i couldn't really do that in a real job interview
S0192	the thing be they're not native speakers either so they don't really speak english that well so there's definitely a bite of a
S0198	but i be like we haven't get this job i need to get out yeah yeah that be awkward
S0192	yeah
S0198	the connection ah it's just
S0192	and they can go from one way like not grill you at all just basically wanna see that you sound english especially on the entry level job they like really grill you
S0233	grill you and make sure
S0192	like really grill you but that we didn't do very well on that one do we we've be travel for too long we weren't in work frame and they just suddenly start grill us so tell us what kind of communicative activities you'd use for compare and contrast the present perfect continuous and the present perfect simple and you're like
S0233	i didn't learn about so i'd be rubbish
S0198	it's actually really straightforward it's like in hindsight now
S0192	well the grammar's simple now we know it now
S0198	but
S0192	it's the problem with grammar it just get deeper and deeper and deeper i don't seem to have find any end to it
S0198	i don't go that deep
S0192	talk a accusative case nominatives there's all sort of stuff it's ridiculous i've literally get
S0198	you're look at him he's look at you
S0192	a powerpoint of about four hundred jargon word that just
S0198	we don't mind grammar school though do we
S0233	no the only time i learn any kind of grammar be really when i do a brief bout of latin
S0198	yeah yeah you do do a brief bout of latin
S0192	to learn languages you need to don't you you know
S0198	sixth form i i've be er i have to take a language i get to take free language class which be nice
S0233	ah cool
S0198	but i have to do it as part of one of my modules
S0233	which language be you gonna pick
S0198	i be gonna do spanish which be probably against
S0192	a cheat but
S0198	the point of why they're make me learn a language cos i already know some but i'd actually like formal lessons in it and to try and re cement all the stuff that we learn whilst travel but
S0192	we're do completely different modules
S0198	they prefer you to choose something you haven't study before yeah
S0233	fresh what be the options everything
S0198	no not everything there's quite a mixture actually there's obviously french and italian and german there's arabic there's japanese
S0233	there's quite a mixture of like
S0192	do some arabic we're off there next
S0198	yeah
S0233	i think arabic would be quite useful
S0192	as long as you'll be good with your consonants
S0198	yeah that's true we be go off to yeah but i know it's gonna be horrible and i don't wanna do nothing i don't wanna do something
S0192	i mean elementary beginner arabic should shouldn't be too bad
S0233	do you know any arabic word
S0192	i can write my name in arabic but that's it
S0198	do you
S0233	no
S0198	oh right you be say it like you be gonna surprise me with something
S0234	's fluent
S0198	can write his name in arabic
S0192	it's like it's backwards isn't it so
S0198	so it mean whenever we've be to a mosque somewhere like famous like a tourist thing that you visit
S0192	it's correct they're like yeah yeah
S0198	it's almost like a prayer book thing you can write in so there's numerous ones over the world now where 's just write his name in arabic think you're mean to write a bite more okay maybe arabic i should take then i'll have to look at the course time
S0192	try to imagine you speak arabic
S0198	might just still
S0192	you'd be better with klingon i think it's very similar isn't klingon and arabic
S0198	this the support i need
S0192	no you'll you'll be great at arabic you'll be great
S0198	i love you too darling
S0234	isn't there the thing on game of throne isn't that
S0233	dothraki
S0192	dothraki
S0234	dothraki isn't that base on arabic
S0198	i think some of it be arabic and
S0234	and and they actually have slip in erm like geek joke into it
S0192	yeah i do see an article on that
S0198	oh okay
S0192	you like game of throne don't you see any
S0234	er i mean i watch it i don't know whether i can classify that i like it
S0198	that's fine
S0233	i've read the book
S0192	i be lame enough to read the book also
S0198	yeah yeah 's read the book
S0192	all five thousand page of them
S0233	they're really good for when you're commute those cos you just whizz through them
S0192	do you find though that the first three how many be there there be five the first three
S0233	i get confuse cos didn't they squish two of them together
S0192	that's the fourth and the fifth i think i didn't really like the fourth and the fifth the first three be i mean i'd see the the tv series first and it be very quotable he'd just take all of the dialogue from the book really
S0233	the erm the issue with it be be that there be character you like and there be character where you like turn the page and you're like oh please don't x character
S0192	yeah ah no er it be yeah
S0233	cos you're like oh gotta read that
S0192	bran i can't stand bran's story i think it be shit
S0233	bran stark yeah erm yeah yeah so yeah i don't like the bran stark stuff
S0192	no no no
S0233	and i don't like particularly all of the stuff in dawn
S0192	no no no
S0233	like
S0192	i've forget it so it didn't stick very well
S0233	yeah dawn where yeah the and story i don't know
S0198	yeah
S0233	like it be just like he's add this whole other area and it's all fine and everyone's get their theories about why he's do that in relation to john snow
S0198	there be a lot of theories yeah
S0192	there's the equal whatever jay or some bullshit
S0233	yeah so you know what's gonna happen i don't know
S0192	no one's gonna care by the time it actually
S0233	i do care i just the thing be like cos the whole point of like when i read the first book it's kind of i know that i be get myself cos i only read them like last year
S0192	mm
S0233	i know i be get myself into a long slog and potentially a slog that will still not be finish until i'm like forty five
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah basically
S0233	or something
S0198	if he take as long write the next couple of book
S0192	ever hear of the wheel of time
S0198	no
S0192	that's a series apparently it's similar along a similar vein but it's
S0233	i mean i'm not really in i'm not really in to fantasy
S0192	like fifteen book
S0198	no no no
S0233	too much if that's what you wanna call it
S0192	no i'm not either no i'm not
S0198	we're not either yeah
S0192	but my friend recommend this so i download and it's like fifteen thousand word book each one and apparently they're think about make that into a tv series
S0198	word
S0192	thousand page book not thousand word
S0198	page yeah
S0192	thousand page book
S0233	i be gonna say that sound readable
S0198	yeah yeah that's fine
S0192	it's a novelette
S0198	that's just a monday afternoon at the moment
S0192	what be you read at the minute anything good

S0233	you're read the secret history
S0234	secret history which i'm not enjoy
S0192	no and yourself
S0233	erm i be read erm this thing which be talk about consumer attitudes towards food
S0192	oh
S0233	cos i'm try to be a bite more on a health kick at the moment so if i read this on the commute i'm just like yeah supermarkets do totally do that to you to make you wanna buy shit
S0192	definitely yeah
S0233	so that's
S0192	all the light
S0233	so that's my motivation thing but on my way down here i be read the guide to the british film institute's london film festival
S0198	oh yeah
S0233	which be start in a few weeks
S0198	oh
S0233	so i be see what be on and turn over page like oh that look good
S0192	yeah
S0233	so
S0192	well let us know if there's anything good on
S0198	recommend that for a read
S0192	we're gonna be poor students now aren't we
S0198	i'm not gonna have time to read things for fun i don't think
S0192	no i don't think so either
S0233	they probably do free film screen and stuff in i imagine like probably quite a lot of them
S0192	would anyone like a glass of red wine i think there's enough for like a glass each
S0233	would you like a glass of red wine
S0198	what time be it
S0234	three thirty
S0198	it's a reasonable time three thirty we'll have one glass and then we'll take a walk out to the beach
S0192	that's a reasonable enough time for a glass of red wine isn't it
S0234	yeah i think so
S0233	cos be say to me he say i don't think i've ever be to and i be like really really
S0198	well we'll take glass
S0192	there's erm a gastronomy fair on on today that's free
S0233	okay sound very good
S0192	might finish at some point so screw cap lovely good quality
S0198	you're blame me for get a screw cap i'm like screw cap's fine though
S0233	that that doesn't from the quality it's the wine
S0234	actually officially it's the
S0198	it's better now isn't it
S0234	yeah scientifically
S0198	that's what i tell him bullshit
S0233	they're well
S0234	well i think i'd make that up
S0198	half convince the girl who tell me make it up
S0234	so i
S0198	cos it doesn't always
S0192	do we actually have any wine glass
S0198	those weird things your mum well
S0234	i'm okay to have it out of a mug
S0233	cup no it's fine
S0192	no
S0198	no just give them a quick rinse
S0192	you know what i'm like with rinse
S0198	doesn't like the sink area
S0192	no i don't like wash things
S0198	it repel him gotta wash something up
S0233	no get away
S0234	but no the thing on the bottom apparently collect the sediment
S0198	oh okay
S0234	erm so good wine should have sediment
S0198	oh
S0234	which be why you normally need to decant good wine
S0198	yeah ah there you go
S0234	that's what
S0198	be that cos it's just be bottle for longer or
S0234	yeah so basically the
S0198	as well as what's in the bottom
S0234	yeah i don't know exactly why but the sediment be important for the wine
S0198	yeah
S0234	and so good wine have sediment which be why you need that bottle and then the idea be that it should all obviously it sink to the bottom time
S0198	yeah ah there you go
S0192	do you guy know anywhere good to eat
S0198	i think you'd know about your wine do you still order wine by the crate
S0234	yeah we've skip one this cos we're try to
S0233	i just drink it i don't
S0234	just drink it

S0198	distribute it wine club be that what you call it
S0192	god be you in a wine club
S0234	yeah it's the best it's the best way to cos i've i've have real er the with the supermarkets be they have the same win so i've actually well i'm not a hundred percent sure but i feel like i've drink every single decent bottle in tesco and sainsbury's
S0198	yeah
S0234	erm and i like try new stuff even though i hate new new world wine especially erm but i like try it just to make sure i still hate it

S0192	my our friend love it she swear by her but then she swear by georgian wine as well so i didn't know georgia be particularly famous for make wine
S0234	georgia in the state
S0192	no georgia as in georgia
S0198	georgia like the country yeah
S0192	she spend her time
S0234	but erm so really weird so erm the lebanon make a fantastic red wine
S0192	oh
S0234	erm it's call a erm er ah forget the name mousar mousar mousar
S0192	i don't think you'd like korean red wine
S0234	oh yeah i think we speak about that i remember
S0192	we do
S0234	my knowledge of korean wine be er i just remember
S0192	we go out for a meal didn't we i think
S0234	yeah we go to
S0192	i think we go to an italian restaurant or something
S0198	yeah
S0234	er what's it call vabiano
S0233	vabiano
S0192	would anyone mind if i smoke out the window
S0233	no
S0234	no
S0192	i can do it in the kitchen or be you join me be you i think you didn't smoke
S0233	whatever i smoke occasionally now
S0198	yeah we quit for a year completely and then when we change job we get a bite complacent and we be drink and we be kind of okay we smoke like maybe one or two cigarettes every couple of weeks or something at the weekend
S0233	i'd be i'd murder if i
S0234	no i wouldn't let i don't let smoke
S0233	no cos we be at a house party a couple of years ago and i think i be just a bite tipsy i be just slip back into my pre ways where i just start chat to people and like oh yeah have a rollie and erm no you get very angry with me
S0233	and we have to leave
S0198	oh that's really angry
S0234	i don't wanna say too much about the the reason i
S0198	yeah
S0234	cos i don't wanna offend you at all but erm
S0192	no you can offend
S0234	erm basically i know the er genetic side of things and what it do to you so
S0198	mm
S0234	i be erm
S0192	please go into detail you might help us to er quit
S0198	yeah we're try to
S0234	well so essentially you can tell erm so if i take your blood
S0198	yeah
S0234	erm as long as you've have a cigarette in the last three months i can tell that you have and that's erm it's a little marker on your actual dna that's change
S0192	yeah
S0234	now you don't you don't want that to happen generally because you i mean it's not a good thing and so i think i do what really be gonna be find out hopefully in you know near future be exactly what the cause of that be and what it do
S0198	and what the implications of that be
S0234	and all the implications
S0198	what the what be people suggest at the moment
S0234	the no one know the problem be what it so it's the area of research that i work on it be find this marker be find er be it fifteen years ago the not the mark of smoke but the the general markers that we have on our dna so it's a big change in philosophy between you know how you've get this nature versus nurture argument
S0198	mm
S0234	well there's actually a case now where nature a lot of people believe that your environment be actually directly affect your
S0198	dna
S0234	dna which be nature technically so it's not just erm you know when you're bear you're pre program and everything you have would you know
S0192	no of course
S0198	mm
S0234	so things like weight seem to be associate with things you could the really interest thing for what i'm gonna do in the future be to do with age so it seem that these markers be particularly relevant for age erm and actually we can now predict someone's age within about three years which be really really cool right
S0192	like ring in a tree
S0234	erm so that really show you how powerful this stuff be
S0198	yeah
S0234	and of course what be really bizarre and be have this i mean this this big conversation last night i be in the pub with my supervisor and another erm lecturer and it's really bizarre there's no fundamental reason why we should age or even die really
S0192	mm
S0234	erm you can make a cell last forever
S0192	don't coy carp i swear i read something a while ago about coy carp effectively they live forever if it wasn't they get too big for their environment and then their like lungs collapse
S0234	yeah so i don't know about coy carp there be certain other examples one of the interest examples be naked mole rat
S0192	yeah
S0198	oh yeah
S0234	live a very long time i think that's find in argentina south america be its erm
S0192	i've hear of it
S0234	base erm
S0198	it's an ugly fucker
S0192	yeah
S0234	largest largest colony be at my university
S0198	oh really
S0234	which be kind of weird erm but it doesn't get cancer at all so it live er that's why everyone's really interest in it cos obviously the biggest cause of death erm once you hit a certain age be cancer erm so yeah so the i guess the reason i'm say all this be we just be find these at the moment we know about these sort of markers and we know erm that they exist and we that they're they look like they're useful cos if you can predict age from them that must mean that age have some there's some reason why that be what we don't know be what the hell they're do
S0192	and do you know if it's come from the nicotine from the add chemicals
S0234	no see that's another thing like so the smoke paper be release like three years ago and it's a really good paper because it's the one it's one of the first so before the it be before age well age be a bite similar time but it's very hard to show weight and and this markers associations but the smoke one be just obvious it's so easy
S0198	yeah
S0234	its be repeat like fifty time
S0192	yeah
S0234	so it's super believable but you know what what we don't know be
S0233	have they do it for alcohol as well
S0234	so they've try
S0198	yeah what be that
S0234	there's some alcohol paper but no no not clear association which be which really go er which really make it interest because you know you're not alcohol just doesn't seem that different than smoke be sort of a health wise way
S0198	yeah yeah social
S0234	yeah so i think it's gonna be an interest thing
S0233	also what about erm be it cos obviously you're talk about tobacco but what about if they've do it or try sample people that don't smoke tobacco but say for example chew it
S0192	mm
S0234	no see that's
S0233	be it the smoke process of the or the actual itself
S0192	this again do the next paper on
S0234	unfortunately i'd need a bunch of people who
S0233	some tobacco chewers that don't smoke
S0192	well go to the state yeah
S0198	just go to tennessee
S0233	yeah
S0198	all of them
S0192	they're all chew it out there
S0234	no unfortunately you can't do so the er the er the interest thing about this i should say to you as a smoker and i should say the person that i work with who i sit next to be a smoker and she know all of this stuff and still smoke so it's er you know
S0198	bunch
S0192	we know it's terrible for us be which be why we've be try to quit for age
S0198	that's why we do quit for a year and swear we'd never go back
S0192	and i'd say we're in a process of quit now
S0234	but if
S0192	we know that we wanna stop but it's so difficult it's so ingrain and the reason that we start again be because we do a year we felt confident we felt comfortable we think we've break the habit now let's have one every so often that's not a problem you know i'm sure if you just have a cigarette once every few weeks or a month i'm sure you'll be fine but then that catch up on you and then you're have a couple this weekend and then five the next weekend and then before you know it you've buy a pack because you've have a stressful week and it just catch back up with you again
S0233	well when i saw
S0198	story
S0233	be er be an e cig convert
S0198	oh be she
S0192	i think they've gotta be worse for you with these unregulated vapour
S0233	yeah she i actually try it i try one puff of it cos i be like oh what be it
S0198	that's amaze that 's convert though
S0233	yeah
S0198	bless her she try
S0233	she have she have this very glamorous obviously she have a glamorous look one
S0198	yeah of course yeah
S0233	she use to smoke sobranies didn't she but erm like those little gold tip thing that have strawberry essence or something
S0192	yeah yeah yeah they're all flavour
S0198	flavour do it taste like chemicals to you cos when we try one of our friend's in korea
S0233	yeah i i be just like
S0198	swallow perfume
S0233	there's something about the sensation of actually smoke smoke and again from a rollie you don't get from a cigarette
S0198	yeah definitely
S0233	be that actually feel like it's something
S0192	mm
S0233	as oppose to cos sometimes if you're smoke
S0198	that's why i don't like cookers cos i don't like the
S0233	because you be take in but then you can't actually feel the smoke it's really bizarre
S0198	no yeah yeah it's the whole sensation of
S0234	but that most likely your brain association with
S0192	absolutely yeah have the rest of the wine
S0234	but the good thing i should say just to round it up be if you stop smoke
S0198	mm
S0234	your dna revert back
S0192	interest
S0234	so it's
S0198	how long do you have to stop for
S0234	er i can't remember how long they profile it but it's a reasonable
S0198	so if it stay in your system for three months
S0234	yeah it's it's a it's i be gonna say three months but i don't think it be three months i think it's longer than that er but i don't think they fully know because
S0192	i mean you can find like i've hear you can find like cannabis in people's hair for like years afterwards that doesn't really change
S0198	we have a friend who er his father's er i mean he's american his father's american it's actually a part of his job description they're not allow to be smokers because of health insurance reason
S0192	it's quite common out there actually
S0234	mm
S0198	but yeah like it's part of your job description you can't smoke cigarettes
S0234	no they've they've erm yeah cos i go to this hr train cos i be be hire someone and there be something about you can't you can't ask obviously you can't ask a lot of question about people's health and things but you can ask if they're a smoker that's one of the only things you can ask
S0198	mm yeah that's one you can ask yeah you're right you can't ask sort of things can you
S0192	they ask us every time we sign up to the doctor's or something they're like do you smoke have you ever smoke course i drink
S0198	yeah
S0233	should have you have you ever do that alcohol thing they survey they do when you gp
S0198	oh yeah yeah yeah i always lie
S0192	we just have to do it for uni we just sign up for
S0198	we just do it for the uni doctor and they be like do you ever eat er consume more than nine units in
S0233	one particular
S0198	in one in one thing
S0233	which be how
S0198	how often do you do this weekly monthly or never i go never
S0233	which be effectively
S0192	three glass of wine
S0198	it's a bottle of wine yeah it's a this wine's nine point four units or something eleven units
S0192	i'm not gonna lie it really have be bad for us so we need to stop drink we haven't really drink until today have we
S0198	no yeah
S0233	don't don't worry yourself i think erm you know
S0234	i think it's also
S0233	you can be quite hard on yourself in your
S0234	yeah as long as you're aware of it i think that's a good
S0233	whatever it's like i think people lose sight of what their behaviours be
S0192	yep when we
S0198	yeah
S0233	cos that's how i feel as well cos i you know i love drink so
S0192	the problem be in korea it's their society's very conducive to drink
S0233	yeah
S0192	everything be about drink so we have a few friends it be here but i think it's easier to because you don't have a support network of your family and your friends and all those kind of people so there be foreigners there that become alcoholics
S0234	oh yeah
S0192	and they don't have people around them to help them to stop them
S0198	to help them to keep it in check
S0192	and and then people come and go so they don't realise quite to the extent how much of an alcoholic this person be then they kinda stay there
S0198	yeah we work with one lady
S0192	lovely lady complete
S0198	who at the first semester at the university we just think you know she's i think she have her shit in order and stuff like that but the longer we get to know her the more we realise that she be get drink constantly during the week
S0233	yeah
S0198	and then they come over in the morning to teach
S0192	i mean she must have get through
S0198	she can drink three bottle of wine on her own and it's just like jesus woman
S0192	oh yeah on a good weekend yeah i've see that lady drink two or three bottle to herself you know what i mean and i she go funny as well
S0198	yeah
S0192	she get a bite schitzo with it she just snap and she's a different person she start pull face and do weird stuff
S0198	yeah funny
S0192	but the problem be her best friend be also an alcoholic to a point where i've see him down a bottle of midday he come to a barbeque that we host for everyone on the roof he down a bottle of wine to himself then down a bottle of champagne to himself
S0198	yeah
S0192	and then go and have two or three bottle of to himself which i don't know if you
S0233	and you tell me about it's like a sort of spirit
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	completely wreck at like three in the afternoon
S0198	like a saki yeah cheap saki
S0192	i come i think the closest i've ever be to like die through alcohol once in korea i don't normally vomit but this be a bad night do you know one fifty one
S0233	yeah
S0234	yeah unfortunately i have a story also about one fifty one
S0198	yeah
S0192	i'd never hear of it before so they crack out the bottle we're shoot one fifty one and then i'm chase one fifty one with whisky so i'm shoot whisky as much
S0198	i wasn't i wasn't partake in this event me and go to bed like normal that night and the guy go out carry on
S0192	one so we go out to a cook out apparently i wasn't i be eat raw pork i wasn't like eat the meat properly
S0233	oh no
S0192	i be to the point where i have to go home and like i think i get lose cos i don't know what happen but i wake up in the morning laugh my head off
S0198	yeah i wake up to like oh no the thing be i wake up go into the bathroom and there be a sink that's
S0192	and i don't vomit ever so this be
S0198	he'd obviously vomit in our bathroom sink it be a bite touch and go so it be block and he'd obviously try to like rinse that
S0233	and then it just
S0198	and so these little shower room we have in korea the entire floor any everything be just cover in this pink vomit
S0198	and then i'm like and then start make noise and i'm like be you awake and he just start laugh to himself in bed i'm like yeah you fuck laugh
S0192	i don't really know what happen but i wake up
S0198	and he's laugh to it's cos you be still drink for like half an hour
S0192	it's really hard to say korean word anyway so like our apartment be that's what you have to say to get to your
S0233	get home
S0192	get to your and obviously i be way too hammer and my mate send me it be a straight line for about two k back to my house now i don't know if i make it and i just dream this or if i get in a taxi but i wake up feel like i couldn't tell the taxi driver how to get there so i wake up in the morning go like i couldn't couldn't go
S0198	laugh laugh to yourself for about twenty minutes until the
S0192	and then i have the shake and i've never have those before
S0233	oh my god
S0192	i be really shake like manage to get a smoothie in me and if i go back to i never sleep in the day so this be how she know i be really bad cos i be just like
S0198	you look fuck ill
S0192	yeah i be bad
S0198	but i think some people have those hangovers more often than
S0192	i mean we we drink the four of us could polish off not could always polish off two bottle of whisky between the four of us that's just a standard the way we drink pretty much
S0198	that's quite drink
S0192	and that's quite a lot of alcohol
S0233	thing be that's the thing though if you drink frequently your tolerance be obviously towards it change
S0198	yeah
S0233	and things like that
S0192	and our tolerance to wine be very low very very low er i can have two glass and it give me a headache pretty much now but back in the uni days we drink wine all the time and it wasn't a problem but now whisky we can pound our whiskys but
S0198	it's just we've be around and her tolerance be so bad
S0233	it's it's it's yeah it's really different isn't it cos obviously we have one hangover on holiday and we drink you know not like load
S0234	oh we drink quite a lot
S0233	well
S0233	we enjoy ourselves
S0234	we have start drink at like
S0233	four o'clock
S0234	on on the beach
S0198	that's why you're look at your
S0233	no no no no that's what i'm say i'm say across the holiday we be fairly okay with the alcohol like cocktails here and there wine with dinner der der der but when we be in we have like a big night out
S0234	and we go to we go to dinner we go to this really nice it be like my mum and dad have give us some money as well which be really nice of them so that we go out for like a special meal
S0198	yeah yeah
S0233	erm and they have this din deal on call spice where all of the top restaurants do like three course for thirty nine dollars which be amaze
S0234	and it be this like
S0233	and the food be like
S0234	it be like michelin star level foods but it be it be cuban inspire as well
S0233	yeah
S0234	which mean it be kind of probably the only place you could get that kind of food
S0233	it be just oh
S0192	plantains
S0233	yeah lot of that
S0198	thirty nine dollars that's ridiculous that's like twenty pound
S0233	it be sort of like inspiration more like the spice and things come through it like i have i have this amaze salmon but it be like share plat and kind of come in this kind of look like a present
S0198	mm
S0234	yeah
S0233	come up and then they have a special guy come and cut the thing and then it all fell apart like little flake
S0192	what be it
S0233	like a cellophane type thing cos they have steam that they have cook it in the thing but
S0234	oh yeah yeah i remember that one
S0233	but it be like it look like a little present and er
S0192	you get that in we be just in cambodia and there's like a curry that they wrap in a banana leaf and it come with a little tie that you can undo it and it's like open up
S0233	but so after that we have wine no we have a cocktail at dinner

S0198	er it's the alcohol
S0233	there's all those calories
S0198	yeah yeah yeah it be yeah definitely
S0192	it's not good for you
S0198	when we travel south america
S0192	i'm surprise you haven't find any markers on your dna from
S0233	from alcohol
S0198	there must be
S0233	and that must mean it's not
S0234	but but i think one of the things be obviously we've be drink as a human race for a long time
S0198	culture for a very long time
S0192	okay so if they look into more asian culture where instead of
S0234	oh well so there be i mean actually say this there be a gene that we have
S0192	yeah
S0234	that the asians don't have
S0198	don't have yeah we know that
S0192	yeah i know that because we be purify water by make beer but they be make tea for like a long time so
S0234	yeah
S0192	so
S0233	that's why they
S0192	lotus tea or whatever kind of teas they have
S0234	basically they they create ceramics too early and er
S0234	they learn how to deal with water whereas we be like ah let's just brew beer
S0192	beer and that will
S0234	and of course the beer we use to drink be you know two percent that's the other thing that's change a lot now
S0198	yeah yeah
S0234	but now it's like four or five
S0198	process
S0233	but that's the same for win as well isn't it cos they're say you know there's the rise of the fourteen percent bottle when actually you know a lot of win
S0234	they should be eleven or twelve yeah
S0198	ah okay
S0234	should be well it depend on the use though
S0233	yeah
S0234	so there be i mean a proper red wine be actually thirteen or fourteen percent
S0192	you'd probably like your you'd probably like korea if you like your alcohol
S0234	yeah
S0192	it's like at seventeen percent or nineteen or twenty one percent or something but it's so cheap i mean it's like one pound for a bottle about this big and it's with everything i mean if you buy it in a restaurant maybe it's two pound fifty but in a shop it's like a pound
S0198	you won't love it though it's a terrible hangover
S0192	it be the most consume alcohol in the world i didn't realise this
S0234	wow okay
S0233	do you do you hear about the erm before
S0198	because china consume it
S0233	yeah well erm
S0198	the amount of bottle that be consume
S0192	i think the reason be
S0198	yeah
S0192	be there be only about two or three company that make soju and with vodkas and other there be various company so there's no one company that sell more of this alcohol than ginro which be the soju make company and like they it's the most consume alcohol in the world
S0233	it's by byjo i think or do i invent that
S0198	byjo
S0233	no no
S0234	byjo
S0233	byjo
S0234	be you not think of when we go oh by jove
S0198	yeah that's what i just think of
S0233	oh byjo i feel like in china there's something make similar to soju but that's call byjo
S0198	byjo it might just
S0233	it's probably the same thing but just like
S0192	they've get what koreans call fire soju which be chinese and that go up to fifty percent so it's more like a
S0198	and it's for the for the same price
S0192	yeah it's for the same price
S0234	i love the idea that
S0198	they're basically drink paint stripper quality be terrible
S0233	not the same not not the same thing at all because obviously you know this be all regulate alcohol we hope erm in most instance it's you know
S0198	yeah
S0192	we've hear of case where people have die from
S0233	well that's what i be say cos there be erm cos obviously you know like a lot of very rich young people in their gap years go to like
S0192	thailand or
S0198	indonesia and place like that
S0233	indonesia and they sell the bucket of alcohol
S0198	yeah that happen recently didn't it yeah
S0233	there be a woman that die through erm basically she think she'd buy gin
S0198	yeah
S0233	die
S0198	she be quite young as well wasn't she
S0233	yeah she be only like nineteen
S0192	we've be in we worry when we're abroad
S0198	that'd be terrible and there be three of them i think and she drink the most
S0233	she she get
S0198	yeah
S0192	there be there be a case of two korean teachers two english teachers but live in korea that go somewhere and they be find
S0198	they be in vietnam weren't they
S0192	in the
S0198	room
S0192	apartments blood everywhere they'd be vomit blood all night
S0233	oh
S0198	they be find dead the next like couple of days later they go miss
S0192	we've have a few teachers die
S0198	they suspect that be through some sort of dodgy alcohol or something that's
S0192	it's part and parcel of travel we be on a beach in the andaman islands three months later i read an article some woman be eat by a salt water crocodile on the exact beach we be just swim on yeah you know what i mean
S0233	god
S0192	we be in a few place in latin america massive volcano
S0234	that's why i like england and
S0198	i know
S0234	no salt water crocodiles
S0198	well for a start you're not gonna stand out long in the sea either fuck that it's freeze
S0192	do you know how do you know how big the salt water crocodiles the biggest one they've ever find be nine metres long nine metre long that's a dinosaur
S0198	they be dinosaurs aren't they
S0192	a nine metre long crocodile
S0198	dinosaurs er crocodiles and shark
S0192	i mean they've be around for as long as
S0234	shark have be around longer i'm not that sure
S0192	they're like perfectly crocodiles also
S0234	but yeah you just the easiest thing with crocodiles be just like stay away from the edge
S0233	into town shall i just say or shall i just text say we'll go into town
S0234	cos the only way they kill people be basically attack as they spring off the floor and then use the their
S0192	like in the shadow
S0234	yeah they can't run can run away from a crocodile very
S0192	in latin america we go to quite a few place with lot of caiman there be like load of caiman i get about that far away from a few we go out at night like lot of caiman and like i've get a picture of me about this far and you can just see the eye reflect on the black and white twenty out there
S0234	oh my god
S0198	which you know where it's
S0192	i'm wonder if by the time we get there it's go to have wind down a little bite
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean we'll head that way do you know a good restaurant somewhere we can eat
S0198	she might know might
S0234	well what about a late nights pub do you know where that be
S0233	oh do they have they get one down here
S0234	yeah they've just open
S0233	do it do anything other than real ale though
S0234	can you well what else do you need
S0198	i know i do like a nice real ale
S0234	so we have so we have a a brewer erm that's near us that they've just open they well i say they've just they've be there over a year now er pop up er pub
S0198	okay
S0234	and by the fact it's be over a year it's not really a pop up anymore right
S0198	no it's establish
S0233	and also then move next door to shop

S0198	alright so it's it's
S0234	so be that be that a do that work
S0198	oh it be work yeah sorry i just start use it automatically it come with this this tablet that
S0234	oh okay
S0198	order for us recently
S0192	thank you very much
S0233	today's date be
S0192	and it say you've get to put the month in word for some reason
S0233	what's the date today
S0192	oh gosh
S0198	the sixth of september
S0234	it's the sixth yep
S0192	yeah it's the sixth
S0198	yeah it's the sixth of september
S0192	do you want something to lean on
S0198	but you can er
S0233	no it's okay
S0234	i'll just i'm just gonna go over there once i
S0192	that you very much for this
S0198	that's what the table be for
S0234	it's alright i'm i'm like in so many study now cos i've get my blood take all the time
S0192	yeah
S0198	so your name's get about be it
S0234	yeah
S0192	well this
S0234	so if they cross reference me with any other and you also sometimes you have to probably not on this one because more for the medical and you have to say whether you're in any other study
S0198	oh right no yeah this isn't consider this be just a collection this be just to create a corpus so
S0192	this be quite interest actually all of us so basically they cambridge university press make a corpus do you know corpus linguistics like a body of linguistics
S0192	they make like a corpus of write language a few years ago from the british public and now they're make a corpus of speak you know for discourse analysis basically so if in the future this be the british national corpus two thousand and fourteen so if anyone in the future turn around and go what do the british sound the public sound like in two thousand and fourteen we will be in that you'll be a member of you know if anyone want to hear what it'll be like you'll be effectively imprint in history for the rest of your life which i think be quite interest
S0198	be in anyway
S0192	like cos i mean for social history like historians be gonna go back and
S0198	the write one that they do be that when they get everyone on the internet to document that day of their live
S0192	i'm not sure
S0198	cos i do that
S0192	they do they do like a
S0198	it be a few years ago
S0192	yeah they do like it be like a three hundred million word corpus so it be massive
S0233	in london for three years
S0198	no i don't know
S0234	yes
S0198	we erm but this this run be like
S0192	yeah they pay us twenty pound an hour of record it's pretty good yeah and we have we can we can do unlimited
S0198	there's some stipulations isn't there
S0192	yeah i mean we have to analyse it afterwards and that kind of stuff but like erm we have an unlimited amount of record with the same people it can be until next june they need that many record
S0198	so they're gonna have thousands of hours of record
S0234	so they
S0192	they need thousands and thousands of hours basically
S0234	so can you can someone ask for access to this data or be this
S0192	once it's publish yeah it will be a part of the corpus
S0198	but as you read in that part the
S0234	google say can i can i have all this data cos obviously there's a lot of voice automation stuff that's be go on
S0192	mm
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0234	and will they ask
S0198	i think i wonder if this be
S0192	from what they're say they're say that it will be use for research and for elt purpose for teach english and for that kind of stuff so you be you might find they take a snippet and you're on a book somewhere and but i doubt it we talk too quickly
S0198	but things like i say this to my brother cos he be like really he be show me his voice recognition on his phone and i be say that's actually quite good because when we be in the state just two years ago and we be use siri on the iphone they it could understand our american friends quite well but it couldn't us at all
S0234	oh you should try i mean if you try it now it's
S0233	siri siri do not like me
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	i've be read quite a bite about
S0198	so i wonder if stuff like this be gonna get sell off towards stuff like that as well
S0192	thing be i've be read a bite about computational linguistics and it's really difficult for them to make this software because it's all well and good say you know they can make the they can understand the word but the problem be polysemy which word that have various mean that come from the same root so if i say just a sentence on its own oh i'm feel really high right now you don't know if high mean mash on drug or if it mean literally altitude that high and the problem with the all languages be that there be so much polysemy so it's really difficult for a computer programme to know which word you're say then you have connect speech the computer programme need to be able to take apart our word it's we know that we're speak in separate word but actually it's completely connect there's no break in the speech so it's
S0198	it have definitely improve though now
S0192	it's improve but from what i've read it's really difficult to make a very good system
S0234	well all all of the algorithms i
S0198	thank you
S0234	er basically build and work on be that so at one point i be think work
S0198	i haven't give you the grand tour yet have i
S0233	yeah
S0198	so this be
S0233	yeah okay
S0234	it's call machine learn
S0192	yeah
S0234	erm and at one point i be think of work in that kind of field so i mean like for me that's why i be ask those question
S0192	yeah
S0234	i'm particularly interest in it on a sort of research level
S0192	be you happy to contribute
S0234	mm mm
S0192	yeah no problem
S0234	yeah yeah
S0192	thank you very much and i guess every time we meet you we'll probably erm need to record again
S0234	no that's no problem i mean you know i i mean i can't be a researcher and not erm give away my data
S0192	no no of course yeah
S0234	do you know what i mean so erm
S0192	and if we can help with any research you're do at any point
S0234	well oh no i've write the wrong thing concentrate six
S0192	be you just write the date yeah september i can't believe it's september already soon come around doesn't it i mean hopefully we can come visit you guy in london at some point
S0234	well i mean i definitely love er you know you guy should come over we'll cook erm
S0192	yes and we'll return the favour of course
S0234	and then yeah you can return the favour
S0192	yeah definitelty as i say if we'd be here a little bite longer i'd have cook
S0234	no i mean totally understand just erm
S0192	still get set up really at the minute
S0234	i'm just try to think i be twenty eight aren't i
S0234	i need 's confirmation of that
S0198	what year be you bear
S0192	yeah
S0234	eighty five
S0198	yeah what month
S0192	which month
S0234	december so eighty five yeah i'll be twenty nine
S0198	you'll be twenty nine in december
S0192	i'm eighty six but i'm twenty eight so yeah i be bear in may be 's your age isn't she
S0198	she's eighty seven
S0234	she's eighty seven may
S0192	so we be in the same year at school i believe and be in the year below us
S0234	yeah be in the year below me
S0198	yeah yeah she
S0192	i take a gap year before uni as well
S0198	when be your birthday in december
S0198	mm
S0192	pretty close to christmas
S0234	yep
S0192	birthday
S0234	mm so for nationality be it just uk or do you want british
S0192	you write what you feel
S0198	you write what you feel yeah yeah we're wonder if this be also something that they'll look into yeah
S0192	this might be part of their study
S0198	yeah
S0192	they might wonder what people be say about their nationality
S0198	because yeah what do you consider your
S0192	especially with your accent what do you consider your accent to be your dialect
S0234	my accent i don't think i have an accent
S0198	yeah there you go exactly that's nice
S0192	and if you think that write it linguistically that's quite interest cos everyone have an accent
S0234	yeah no yeah i i know what i'm erm say be not
S0198	but then yeah but then also
S0234	so be that what mother tongue mother tongue be my english
S0198	no mother tongue be english yeah but i can appreciate cos some people might think well my accent's actually become quite diffuse
S0192	yeah
S0198	so i haven't get an accent from a specific region it doesn't mean i don't have an accent
S0234	which country have most
S0198	england i know i guess that's kind of where it's from
S0192	well you you sound like you've get quite a bite of american influence do you say basil or basil
S0234	er basil
S0198	basil
S0192	good
S0198	it's still english
S0234	accent dialect
S0233	be you just talk about
S0234	so what can i put not none can i put that
S0192	yeah you write what you think
S0198	yeah
S0192	but i mean would you say you have receive pronunciation then
S0234	a what
S0192	receive pronunciation like queen's english
S0198	standardise english
S0234	oh no cos well queen's english to me mean a correct er like bbc radio four english
S0198	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0192	elitest that's call receive pronunciation
S0198	that's receive pronunciation yeah so you know you don't have that but you
S0234	i know i don't that
S0198	yeah
S0192	so if you could pin point any accent what would it be
S0198	what would ah what would any of our accent be at this point
S0233	you be stokey twang southerner
S0198	be that a stokey twang
S0234	that's what call me
S0233	my accent be quite malleable base on who i'm hang around with
S0198	which be good which be er completely part of the whole linguistics i'm with myself
S0233	not necessarily in but when i move you remember i live in north somerset then i could just
S0198	yeah yeah
S0233	i could start get a proper west country thing go on
S0198	oh there you go
S0192	combination
S0233	and similarly when i go back to medway or if i hang around with my dad for a bite cos my dad's accent be quite broadly medway
S0234	do i tick all of there or just the
S0198	yeah it's shock when i go home
S0233	but my mum be
S0192	must be nice to be able to
S0233	my mum be not so much but my dad be
S0198	yeah
S0234	i be just think
S0233	so if i hang around with my dad for a bite i end up get a little bite more rough
S0234	oh this'll this'll this'll
S0198	i've notice
S0192	that's call accommodation
S0198	yeah
S0192	how we converge or diverge with the speakers that be around be
S0233	yeah
S0192	like definitely do you remember when you be a child you go into an indian corner shop and you start emulate they ask you a question and you kind of reply in an indian accent you're like that be really weird i shouldn't so apparently it's a natural
S0198	i've notice erm
S0234	yeah my my little brother do it cos he's now in the state
S0198	oh yeah that must be heavy
S0234	it's within
S0198	but a carolinian accent be quite
S0234	within a week like it be really bizarre like he'd change it completely and i'm just like
S0233	and he's marry to an american woman and erm she's amaze
S0198	it be it be a massive influence on you like go to korea
S0192	oh yeah we use americanisms
S0198	oh yeah yeah my yeah
S0192	i say candy i can't remember if it's a couch sofa or a settee anymore
S0198	someone else tell you settee we don't remember settee
S0192	no erm
S0198	you be like what do we call it
S0192	i say vacation
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	cos it make sense to me like holiday be like christmas or new year or that's a holiday like a festival something religious or something but vacation be the time you have off work so it's actually fill a lexical gap for me
S0234	what do put for topic
S0198	oh nothing we'll do that
S0234	okay
S0198	it be just it be nothing specific we have
S0192	just write various

S0192	so every month we
S0198	so stuff could come back and it's like but it be gonna get trickier because your family a be very talkative and b you be at home but when we're just the two of us in i don't know how we're gonna
S0192	we need people to visit so come up or we'll come to yours
S0233	well we're introduce you to maybe she'll drop by
S0198	yeah that's true
S0233	for a cup of tea also you'll meet people at the university
S0198	at university there should be more than women participate i hope but
S0233	it depend if you want you could incentivise first year students with like a weatherspoons voucher
S0198	yeah yeah i know we do consider monetary
S0233	yeah
S0198	i'll buy you a beer if you come to the pub with me
S0192	i'm tell everyone that i meet like you guy you wanna make some record just the two of you or whoever else we'll pay you nine pound an hour for
S0233	yeah
S0192	we'll get the other nine pound i mean you could do that
S0233	it's not a bad little racket
S0192	no nine pound an hour's still good for just prick press play you know what i mean like press record
S0234	i still don't like where have they get the money from
S0192	yeah it's just a lot of
S0198	it's from fund so corpus i suppose just some linguistics fund
S0192	thousands and thousands of hours of record
S0233	my boss be quite an interest person to talk to
S0192	er eight it's eighteen pound an hour
S0233	because he be nigerian
S0192	and it's pro rata'd so like ten minutes be three pound
S0234	i'm i'm surprise well i guess it's cos of the uk boom but you know there's like thing now on the internet where you can go online you can say you have job you can offer job and people do it so i be i be actually meet with a company the other day that be try to detect emotion in your voice
S0192	mm
S0234	erm because it's obviously apparently the big thing for be when people ring customer service centre
S0192	yeah
S0234	what they can then do be they take the first when you first ring they you should be angry but then they can measure the performance of the service by work out whether you've diffuse
S0192	how much more relax you be yeah
S0234	whether you've diffuse that and so that's what the company's base on and the biggest problem they've get be they need people to they need a database of angry voice and
S0192	yeah
S0234	like not angry voice and try and work but of course if you say to someone act angry
S0192	it's not real
S0234	they generally like just say well they what this guy be say be that what happen be people get louder and anything so what they're try to do now be take movie clip
S0192	yeah
S0234	of of various things or just general youtube videos and so but what they then need be people to er determine whether that person be angry or not
S0192	yeah
S0234	er and so what they've start to do be release these videos short bite of audio essentially actually so it's just audio not cos also when you also take information from the face when you're look at a video so it's just audio
S0192	like queue on
S0234	and they're pay people like twenty i think it be like twenty p or like it's absolutely no money
S0192	no and we're get twenty quid an hour
S0234	and you're get like twenty quid
S0192	twenty quid an hour this be perfect for us the only reason i find this be cos i sign up to the university linguistics department prior and about a month ago this be post on that group and it just say call you know and it's gotta be members of the british public can't be anyone else erm seem like too good to be true to me
S0234	well yeah that's why i ask whether you get pay
S0192	i mean it's cambridge university press so it can't be too bad and they've i've already send my invoice off i send off twenty hours we've already get another ten hours ready to go this month
S0234	i guess you have to have the equipment though and that
S0192	yeah we have to buy these we've get one each but they be like forty quid each so after two hours you've get you've make you money back erm record in a car be that a little bite too noisy record out in a park be almost like
S0234	yeah
S0192	so we need to get people in our room like be
S0234	yeah
S0192	so we can sit down and kind of do it and then i have to there's a little bite of discourse analysis afterwards just a little erm just ask me erm what be the topics would you know be it advise be it request be it you know anecdotal like just general it's a very quick discourse analysis base on it so i don't know what they're test i really don't know but various areas i would imagine one of them might be like erm topicality like what topics be people talk about depend on their relationships cos in one of the question they ask you be you know be this close family be this friends be it loose friends be it this kind of stuff so i guess the topics that be speak about because they ask me to list every topic there's and i mean today how many topics have we speak about
S0234	mm quite a lot of topics
S0192	quite a few yeah so i have to go back and listen i don't have to listen to the whole thing
S0234	yeah you just skip through it
S0192	but i skip every few minutes
S0234	yeah
S0192	cos people talk about the same topic roughly for about three or four minutes so then it kind of change
S0234	it could be really interest as well like you could if you could define the areas of topics you could start i mean you have all that data you could see how long topics last and then and then you you probably work out what and you can start think about what yeah
S0192	yeah definitely depend on do topics last longer if there's only two speakers rather than four
S0234	well yeah
S0192	be there topics move around quicker like this kind of stuff i don't know they do all this when there's two different conversations go on that must be a bite difficult but erm i'm hop that you know by the time it come round to write my dissertation i'm gonna have hundreds of hours of record at that point so i'm hop that i can do dissertation base on this somehow but i'm a bite worry that cambridge have buy this material and i don't know whether they'll allow me to use it for my research
S0234	well if the if it's a public database
S0192	then it should be allow so yeah
S0234	yeah you just have to write to them i'm sure i'm i'm fairly sure
S0192	i mean surely i can use my own record but i mean i guess i'm sell them to them so they become their property so i don't really know but erm
S0234	you just i mean presumably you've sign something
S0192	i've sign a contract i've get a freelance contract
S0234	yeah
S0192	i now have to it's annoy as well i have to be self assess for tax and stuff like that to do this job it's a little bite annoy
S0234	that so my my mum and dad be tax er they basically my dad work for so you know all this er er tax avoidance and
S0192	mm
S0234	evasion so one's right and one's not right he be basically he use to do that stuff for big company which be kind of hilarious er that it's all like hit the news cos it's be go on for like
S0234	er
S0192	i haven't see it on the news
S0234	oh okay so now it it come about because erm the biggest one that hit be jimmy carr
S0192	okay
S0234	erm basically offshoring his tax you know basically his money and actually a lot of entertainers so gary barlow happen a couple of weeks erm
S0192	i'm pretty terrible with celebrities i'm not gonna lie
S0234	well he be in take that
S0192	okay oh right i think he be in coronation street
S0234	no gary no there may be a barlow in coronation street
S0192	be there a barlow
S0234	but this be the lead no one of the lead singers of gary barlow and then erm he be also in like the one of like the x factor tv show or something like that
S0198	okay
S0233	yeah so he's from nigeria but i'm not quite sure background i get a vibe from him that his dad's quite important like he be like mid forties but i think he come from quite a
S0198	yeah well yeah important family
S0233	from nigeria or wherever so live in london for like you know the last twenty twenty years or whatever speak with a very precise articulate but then he's get one west african very interest voice
S0198	yeah yeah some examples of that actually cos in korea just walk around go into shop across the rochester bridge go buy my spice i like english such a thick accent but the guy behind the counter he be indian but he speak with a very well pronounce much better than but it be funny watch him interact with
S0233	but it's really accent and things like that because i mean i don't know how i speak before i go to university
S0198	yeah
S0233	but it's change have change
S0198	yeah i i think i don't think i go home
S0233	cos and to me they talk like like switch
S0198	yeah yeah
S0233	whereas sometimes i think she ham her medway up
S0198	i think she do i agree
S0233	i think maybe she do also because her voice because if she have to speak french
S0198	no exactly so i think she's probably come from a position she probably over accommodate for her or whatever situation that she's in which in like the last ten years have be medway and also yeah she's probably the most she speak french and stuff so her and her sister she say her brother yeah and speak french i think that's great to be bilingual i think that's really awesome to have
S0233	the be medway
S0198	when i it down with or i saw them the last time
S0233	well yeah
S0198	i be i be like what and also when i go out with her sister 's get a really thick accent too we meet up with and his partner's have so sometimes i'm just like
S0233	and i i i think medway accent be actually it's not like er essex
S0198	no no it's not quite the same as essex and it's not a lot of people aren't they it's not the same as yeah yeah yeah accent change
S0233	so consequently it mean if i ever go back to medway i just kind of well i don't know i don't medway accent i actually find it more perception to me the really posh
S0198	yeah yeah yeah it's the way they treat you i get that a little bite they know who i be but it's like you don't sound right i'm sorry i'm try to but when erm when i've move van it be interest listen to myself then and listen to myself when i be with my mum and my dad cos i definitely speak i accommodate much more for the dad yeah do it all the time well not everyone do it speak well conscious about it
S0233	i'll just i'll just go to the kitchen
S0192	oh okay and they've be
S0234	well basically the worst thing about it be that they set up a company or something to pay struggle artists
S0192	yeah
S0234	but not really
S0234	it be just a way of you know basically pay corporation tax rather than income tax cos corporation tax be lower or whatever i don't understand it
S0192	which make no sense
S0234	yeah erm
S0192	i never really understand why you tax people when it's much simpler to tax corporations i don't understand why they deal with fifty million
S0234	er cos cos the think process be be that the corporations be gonna make money for the government by employ people who you then tax
S0192	but my think process be the only way to make money really be through a corporation and therefore wouldn't it be easier to tax say twenty thousand corporations than seventy million people
S0234	but if you so
S0192	it would be easier wouldn't it
S0234	so let's let's say that you increase corporation tax then apple will say well we're not gonna sell our iphone anymore erm
S0192	i mean i personally
S0234	and then people would be like what we want an iphone
S0192	i mean i i mean we're talk about a whole change of model now because i personally would erm i would change profit margins in general and like how much people can earn and all that kind of stuff i think if your business isn't isn't gonna work it's not a viable business and it shouldn't go on one thing that's really bother me have you see this zover something or other
S0234	zover
S0192	have you ever see an advert i only know about it through second hand cos i haven't be in the country but there's like music magpie or something
S0234	yeah
S0192	yeah where you give your cds for pittance
S0234	yeah
S0192	you get like thirty pence
S0234	yeah
S0192	i've get about four or five hundred cds and i be think brilliant don't need them anymore i'll sell them i come to have a look on the internet on amazon for these company and this be what i would consider a not viable company in today's society there's this company call zoverstocks they will undercut anybody sell a cd second hand by a penny they just have an automatic piece of software that just undercut everyone to the point where they're pretty much sell you know ninety percent of cds like popular cds for a penny and they're make their money off the postage but the way i think about this and they turn over about three million a year off or four million a year something like that and i've just get this feel like if i have to physically send through the post my disc to you you then pay thirty p then you have to send through the post that disc to somebody else you're not make any money any profit off the cd you're simply make about fifty pence to a pound off the postage for you to make fifty pence or a pound this vehicle have to drive to wherever and then away from wherever to make two or three million pound you're you're effectively do eight million journey around the country just to make a it's not a viable business model there's too much waste of resources for how much profit you're make in my opinion those kind of businesses shouldn't exist you're not make enough money
S0234	but but they be make money
S0192	they're make but if you think if it's if your model be that this product have to be drive to london and then drive to newcastle
S0234	but hang
S0192	and you make fifty pence
S0234	yeah
S0192	so you have to have millions of these to pay for your company that mean that that car be drive around the uk millions of time just so that you can make a million pound just seem detrimental to society to me
S0234	oh of course it's detrimental to society but if you're make money you can't stop people
S0192	well of course in the capitalist model you'd say well the sky's the limit
S0192	but i i guess what i'm say be i'm against that kind of business model
S0234	yeah oh no that's
S0192	i think and some way korea work where england doesn't be they still have service they still have businesses that be basically non profit that be they view them more as service when you go to a bank in england you want a new card you'll probably queue up at the cashier they'll then tell you sorry we can't deal with this here you need to go and use that phone on the wall so then you go and ring the phone and then they tell you you'll get a new card through the post in a week or two in korea you get the card make for you right there and then in front of you they do it yeah or there's water in there they'll give you biscuits and food there's certain things be treat like a service still
S0234	oh yeah but
S0192	bank be still a service there
S0234	oh bank have change a little bite maybe since if
S0192	maybe it have i haven't be bank in years
S0234	and also the post office have start to do this thing where instead of go to a counter you get like a number and you can go and sit and they'll bring you tea
S0192	oh nice
S0234	and all this kind of stuff and then you go up to a counter and then you sort your things out and then you you're do
S0192	so that service have come i guess what i'm say on the broader scheme be you know education transportation utilities these things shouldn't be profit organisations
S0234	oh yeah i mean i have big problems with with
S0192	if you take that profit and let's just use public transport as an example if you take that profit and say that all of that profit must go into reduce the cost of ticket improve your service pay you staff more just make these non profit organisations i mean of course they're privatise now so it's not gonna happen but
S0234	i know my big i i i be like i just really wish that transport be not a private you know organisation
S0192	transport in this country be bonkers completely bonkers
S0234	like
S0192	like national express if you live anywhere within the gravity of london then your national express vehicle be gonna stop in london for about three or four hours so if i wanna go from brighton to canterbury which should be about an hour to an hour and a half on a bus it's gonna take six hours and it's gonna drive to heathrow and then stop for three hours and then drive on back and it do that with everything we want to get from bath to birmingham it's only about an hour and a half up this road you know but you have to go through london wait at heathrow i mean it's just ludicrous it's really easy in korea public transportation there be good like it's a good service it's i think one of the best things about korea be how reasonable the country cost they pay quite well but like you wanna traverse the country you're talk a biggest a biggest journey's maybe six seven hours across the excuse me across the country you're gonna look at pay no more than ten fifteen pound for a ticket on a bus things be affordable you wanna eat out it's always three pound or six pound
S0233	i think my phone's stop do outgo call it's a bite bugger the screen's go the screen's be get run over so text like a text
S0198	yeah yeah i would mine but it credit how do it get run over
S0233	er we be we hire a van to move some stuff into our flat from
S0198	no no
S0233	and i think it must have and erm hire van iphone be take part of london what happen be there be a street cleaner on our road smash up phone in the street wait until we contact together
S0198	that's really nice nice have you message though
S0233	yeah well she may have be meet some other people i'm not sure but i think if we just go go somewhere
S0198	yeah
S0233	and then if i see her if i see her if i don't so
S0198	i'm just gonna do something
S0234	yeah the only problem with with i mean it's weird right be happen especially in the uk be that so all of these things involve people that you've gotta employ
S0192	and those people need to be pay a wage
S0234	and they need to be pay a wage that they can live on
S0192	to their live
S0234	but then so in order to do that if if the live cost be high initially now they as they be now then they have to get pay so you can't reduce the cost of the train ticket
S0192	no no
S0234	so live like it's a weird circle of you know issue
S0192	i i think americans be actually do quite well i don't know if just the demographic of americans that we meet in america be more middle class but it seem to me that they come from more affluent families their families have more land
S0234	yeah but their
S0233	it's about space
S0234	it's space yeah that's what it come down to and
S0192	but then ask them how much they earn like their earn be equitable if not slightly more than what my family be on in england you know what i mean my dad have be a civil engineer for years he's probably on about twenty two k my mother work for the government work in the borough she's probably on about eighteen grand a year and i speak to my america friends teachers get pay more there and this kind of stuff but yet the cost of live be lower and even when you include healthcare i mean we pay through the nose for healthcare we do pay for it we think it's free but we pay pretty sure if you add up all the tax in this country we pay about fifty percent in tax if you add vat twenty percent on everything we purchase
S0234	well i pay i pay
S0192	then you've get twenty percent on tax another ten percent on
S0198	yeah how much do you pay in tax you've go past that line
S0234	i've go past i've go past the line this year unfortunately
S0192	so just over forty
S0234	i'm on forty percent now
S0192	nice but that's forty percent of anything you earn above forty k
S0234	yeah that that's the nice thing and also you and the nice thing they're do which be really
S0192	bloody hell man you're on forty grand
S0234	and so the nice thing that they're do be er they're give a ten ten grand er free tax allowance now
S0198	yeah they be aren't they yeah
S0192	yes yeah they've up them haven't they
S0234	which be i think when i
S0192	it be six before
S0234	it be like six or seven when i first start
S0192	yeah
S0234	so that's like you know quite a considerable increase which be why i know it's sad to say well the i mean
S0192	cos people be struggle
S0234	people be in trouble and the conservatives be actually realise that actually it's not a bad way of do things
S0198	yeah yeah
S0234	erm it's the only i think it's probably the only thing they've do right
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah in the last four years
S0233	the thing that they've not do right be on the headline of the independent today which be bedroom tax
S0198	oh yeah that be
S0192	i've hear about this if you have a spare bedroom in a council property or something
S0198	that's only with that's council property though
S0234	yeah
S0233	philosophically it might work but if you've not get the infrastructure to move people into one bed flats that don't exist then it's just penalise people
S0234	yeah yeah that's that's
S0198	cos they don't actually they don't create very much council accommodation that isn't a two or three bed house
S0234	that's that's that's the problem that
S0198	that's cos they're create it for families so there be a problem
S0233	so that's what i'm say philosophically it all work if it be a jigsaw puzzle you could just around
S0234	well no it's
S0198	but isn't it just but isn't that still dependent on your situation er i can't remember the ins and out of that
S0234	no no it's all it's base
S0198	it's just base on a spare bedroom
S0234	it's base on if you're in a council er house
S0198	and you have a spare bedroom
S0234	and you have a spare bedroom although
S0198	your benefit will get reduce
S0234	two spare bedrooms you're allow one spare bedroom
S0233	you you pay you pay a premium
S0234	you pay
S0233	the same way that if you be a single person occupy a double bedroom or a twin bedroom in a hotel you pay a premium
S0198	though they be these people that be in these house actually pay a premium or be their benefit just get reduce
S0234	well no no no they have to their rent go up
S0233	well cos they're not their benefit be pay out the same but their rent be more
S0234	yeah
S0198	oh okay so they be pay rent from
S0192	spare bedroom in a council house
S0198	i mean it doesn't matter if it's come from their benefit or something
S0234	no two spare bedrooms
S0192	two spare bedrooms
S0234	you've gotta have one you're allow a extra bedroom
S0198	an extra room
S0234	so you're allow a guest room but you're not allow two guest room
S0198	yeah
S0192	yet a landlord can own twenty properties thirty properties it's not a problem
S0233	yeah no we're not say that the bedroom tax be a good thing
S0192	no of course
S0198	no no yeah yeah yeah
S0234	well i
S0198	i don't know
S0233	it's a it's a dysfunctional thing
S0234	i i actually i think it be a good thing i
S0233	philosophically it may be a good thing to try and have larger properties allocate to those people that need them yes
S0234	i don't think it should be in though
S0192	of course yeah
S0233	but it doesn't work like that when you've not get the infrastructure to
S0234	yeah the problem be the problem be there's a different yeah
S0233	support people move so what you're actually do be just penalise people for their situation
S0234	but but it's well know that money the best way to do anything be to to use money so for example stop people stop the population from smoke you tax cigarettes it's work it's prove to work
S0192	do you think that's the best way
S0198	they're do a combination of things right now
S0234	it be the best way scientifically the best way to stop people smoke
S0192	scientifically
S0198	statistically
S0234	yeah
S0198	be that what
S0192	i don't know if i agree with that so tobacco company or whoever be still make just as much money off these things only people be pay more for less
S0198	in in america in tennessee
S0234	yeah but it stop so it stop so ah basically if people can't afford to do it they generally stop it and they and if they see that it's a money be a big driver in people's philosophy everywhere
S0192	well of course it have to be we live in a monetary paradigm so it can't not be a massive driver but
S0198	yeah thing be a lot of poor people still smoke
S0192	but erm
S0234	yeah the problem the problem with what what it cause
S0192	it just mean that they're pay more for what they're smoke they're pay more for what they're drink
S0198	i think less people start to smoke that's definitely work
S0192	erm i think
S0233	well i think i think they're glamorise it again in a weird way
S0198	yeah yeah be e cigarettes age restrict e cigarettes
S0233	i think it's eighteen
S0192	yeah it's still
S0198	oh it's eighteen
S0192	the same as cigarettes
S0233	well the same as tobacco
S0198	i think i'd hear something on the radio that suggest that as long like it be younger
S0192	i just don't like that model that you know we want people to drive slower so let's put speed cameras everywhere and just charge the money
S0234	yeah it work it work
S0192	it work because but there be other things that would work i mean why don't you just have speed restrictors on cars why can cars go faster than the speed limit they shouldn't be able to
S0234	ah no because it's actually it's a safety issue that be
S0192	okay i understand that but i mean i personally don't really like cars in general
S0234	oh no i mean i erm
S0192	i would go for
S0234	i have a car and i like my car a little bite but the more i live in london and there's certainly build up areas there be just no way people should be drive
S0192	no
S0234	just absolutely no way
S0198	it's completely unnecessary
S0192	it should be completely pedestrianised there should be effective public transport between cities
S0198	and then you just need to reduce the cost of transportation
S0192	and if you wanna drive go to a race track go and rent a car out and drive it
S0234	yeah no exactly yeah
S0192	that's how i feel
S0234	i agree with
S0233	i have to deal with public train a public speak thing at work when we have to train ourselves on presentation skills and we have to talk about a topic we be passionate about
S0234	oh yeah
S0233	and mine be the car free city
S0192	yes
S0233	so i'm very much at home here
S0192	i'm very for that
S0234	now 's erm i mean be the biggest car free city person i have ever meet like she love it
S0192	we can't stand cars at all
S0198	you're in you're in
S0192	but i've have people turn around to me and say but car be freedom and i feel like turn around and say you have drive from work to home to work to home and maybe you go on a little detour every so often
S0198	that's what we be say
S0192	we we forty countries
S0234	we've join erm the car club for example
S0192	yeah
S0234	that's freedom that's like the case of if we need to go out of town
S0192	yeah
S0234	we need to hire a car because we need you can't get there easily like you be say how it's bloody impossible to go from here to
S0192	yeah
S0234	in an easy route you know then you hire a car but you don't need as you say drive to work and drive home
S0192	no my personal my personal preference i think a way of move to the next step would be nobody own cars you don't own them there be just cars out on the street
S0234	a bite like the
S0198	on the outer city limit perhaps
S0192	and you go out and you i don't know put a coin in a you have a registration you have some registration
S0234	no they have so you have a card
S0192	really
S0198	oh really cheer there you go then this keep happen to me
S0192	good that should be that should be i've be say that for years
S0198	his ideas keep come true
S0192	come to fruition yeah
S0198	ah so how do that work
S0234	you just basically have a card you book it online so you've get an app you can actually even you just use the app
S0192	find where the cars be and
S0234	basically they have specific park space in london now
S0233	yeah we've get two round the corner from us
S0234	there's two literally round the corner but there's also a third one down the road
S0198	and be they delivery point and pickup point
S0234	and no unfortunately the worst part about it be you have to drive back the car belong to that space so you can't
S0192	what i'm think of effectively be you just turn you just take the key out and then the car stay wherever it be you go in your house and somebody else come out and use
S0234	yeah so that's what they
S0233	they've get they've get they've get something like that in paris
S0192	yeah
S0234	and so what they
S0192	i think that's the way forward
S0234	so what they do yeah i mean that's that basically the the the next step of
S0233	boris bike but cars
S0192	you don't need to feel like you need a car there be so many people that need a car but use it just to go to work and back and that's it car pool have a bus that take you to work i don't know something
S0234	or cycle
S0192	live closer to work work from home
S0234	i would i would cycle do you know what i would cycle to work
S0198	yeah they're out here
S0234	if there weren't cars on the road
S0192	no no i would yeah cars be very aggressive as a cyclist okay
S0234	no it's just
