S0043	yeah yeah yeah right
S0158	or whichever one it be
S0043	yeah no it be eh it be heavy go but it be eh it be good it be really nice really nice sunny and dry and sunny
S0158	hello there what can we do for you where be we ah i know we be we be talk about talk about walk walk yeah
S0043	walk walk in the lakes walk in the lakes
S0158	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0043	but we're go up again we're go up on the
S0158	same place
S0043	twentieth no we're go no we're go to ravenglass
S0158	oh right the roller
S0043	on the twentieth
S0158	superb pub at the bottom
S0043	a what
S0158	superb pub at the bottom
S0043	right another pub
S0158	yeah and and then a little railway line that wind its way up into the hill it's lovely and then you end up in another lovely pub call the boot
S0043	tell me what these what these be call
S0158	the the one at
S0043	they're call the boot and the
S0158	the the one actually at ravenglass be the ratty or something like that
S0043	be that be that be that dead obvious where the near the station
S0158	oh you can't miss be you can't there isn't much in that part of the world
S0043	it's very small isn't that i know
S0158	it's kind of its stick on its own and you can't possibly miss be because it's right by the side of the the proper railway right and then you have to walk a little way up to the the railway which be the one that take you up to whichever village it be boot
S0043	boot
S0158	be the name of the village
S0043	oh right yeah okay
S0158	and there's three pubs there all of which be excellent
S0043	right
S0158	i've be to all three of them
S0043	right
S0158	test and test and try by smell so they're fine personal seal of approval and all that kind of thing
S0043	excellent oh no that's good that'll be good we need to it's a two nighter so we're go to have one full day there so it'll be good
S0158	blimey you branch out
S0043	no it's a cheap one give over
S0158	yeah cos normally you only do one night
S0043	only that's only to do with the price
S0158	ah i see
S0043	and the and what and what the offer be cos if it's a the offer tend to only be one night but this be a two nighter and it's only i say only for two of us for two nights seventy nine pound bed and breakfast
S0158	that's not bad at all
S0043	not bad at all it's like twenty pound each isn't it thereabouts so it's not too bad
S0158	i know one place cheaper than that and that's only because i get discount be a member it's not fair from there actually em which be a place you'll have to go through to get at ravenglass you'll see it it's call the
S0043	yeah
S0158	but you get a discount there for your but that bring the price down for a double room bed and breakfast thirty six quid you know in this this day and age
S0043	for two of you
S0158	what that's it's room price
S0043	yeah that's very good
S0158	so seventy two pound for two nights and the beer be a very reasonable price he usually charge about one fifty to one pound sixty a pint where you think most pubs these days be a lot more expensive
S0043	be it a long way to it to walk
S0158	what to
S0043	could you walk to it
S0158	eh i i i don't know i've only ever be by train
S0043	further back mm i wonder if you can i wonder if you can still walk i wonder if you could walk to it and then end up there at that place
S0158	investigate have a look at the railway line
S0043	you know what i mean yeah
S0158	cos i can't remember what the distance be between the two it's it's a fair way because em foxguild be at the bottom of cumbria just above arndale and place like that arndale arnside
S0043	arnside
S0158	right but ravenglass if further round the side about about a third of the way up so above eh let me think about his go on towards windscale around there
S0043	yeah cos it would be nice just to have a really good just a good day out you know be it part walk drive maybe i bet we have to drive i don't know but
S0158	yeah yeah yeah well there's lot of things you can do round there
S0043	yeah cos it's near the it's on the coast isn't it
S0158	and it's it's worth have a look at place like not barrow in furness other one something in furness warton in furness be a lovely little town

S0126	yeah i know yeah
S0158	that'll be good probably to italy
S0126	yes you like italy don't you
S0158	well i for a vegetarian it's the ideal place to go cos you can eat all over the place and they don't think you're strange
S0126	yeah no i agree yeah
S0158	so if you go to france and germany and austria and place like that like and you say sorry i don't eat meat and they look at you like you've get a third arm
S0126	yes austria particularly i find that yeah
S0158	you don't what you don't eat meat be there something wrong with you
S0126	you don't eat meat very strange yes yeah but italy be great save you
S0158	it be well there's no there's no em there's no big deal about not eat meat there which be great plus the booze be wonderful and even better it's reasonably cheap compare to french austria spain
S0126	yeah i suppose it be really yeah
S0158	especially switzerland where they charge you an arm and a leg
S0126	oh switzerland be mega expensive yes yeah
S0158	it's a real rip off and they take the money off you leave right and centre and you don't get very much in return from what i've find in eh in switzerland so we won't ever be go back there we go once for a week just to see what it be like and the boss say right that's it that's permanently cross off the list so i mean
S0126	well it's always they're always a bite grumpy as well there as well i find
S0158	grumpy
S0126	that's what i've notice i've only ever be through it once and that be in
S0158	probably cos you weren't spend money at the time
S0126	yeah that's it i didn't have any money i be a poor student
S0158	it's not the point if you go through switzerland they expect you to cough up in one way or the other
S0126	that'll explain why they be grumpy with me
S0158	so yeah i bet you didn't even have a credit card in those days do you
S0126	no i didn't i don't think we have credit card in those days it's that far back
S0158	no please please they've have them at least since the late nineteen sixties
S0126	well when we first get marry we didn't have a credit card cos i the first holiday we go abroad well first time we fly to spain we'd be to france i know we didn't have a credit card because we have spend up all our money and we be delay about fourteen hours at alicante airport you know
