S0417	what about art have you get all your stuff
S0416	art i have
S0416	it's just tedious really

S0417	mm
S0416	and it's like this thick per line
S0416	and i've load them do like three in an hour like
S0416	all like that and it cover half my page
S0417	why couldn't you get a bigger marker
S0416	because it ruin the accuracy
S0417	okay
S0417	erm what about english
S0416	english
S0416	english i'm do fine in
S0416	miss 's
S0416	yeah miss 's back
S0417	mm
S0416	like half of the last year
S0416	no half
S0416	no i think she be back a long time ago
S0416	i er i might be get muddle up
S0417	what about science
S0416	we're do to kill a mockingbird
S0416	science be fine i'm try to think of what we be do last
S0416	last time
S0416	oh we be do atoms and sodium
S0416	and chloride
S0416	and why they're stick why they stick together
S0416	be
S0416	chloride if i'm if i remember correctly
S0417	mm
S0416	have two inner shell and then it have
S0418	mm
S0416	eight in its middle shell and then one
S0416	in its out in its outer shell
S0417	oh do it i don't know
S0416	and then sodium have
S0416	eight and seven in its outer shell
S0416	and they have complete shell like chloride would prefer to lose one
S0417	mm
S0416	from the top one
S0417	mm
S0416	so then just the ones that it have plete sodium would like one more one more electron
S0417	yeah
S0418	mm
S0416	one more electron oh yeah i forget they're they're electrons
S0417	mm hm
S0416	one more electron to complete its outer ring
S0417	yeah
S0416	and when they when when they combine together the little little electron in its outer ring for for chloride go go into the little slot
S0416	and they
S0417	mm
S0416	and they stick together and that make salt
S0417	i see
S0416	and salt be completely edible and tasty even though sodium explode and chloride be a poisonous gas
S0417	it's mad isn't it that like two mad substances can make something that
S0416	yeah and ask a funny question
S0417	what do he ask
S0416	er he ask that if you get like a gas chamber
S0417	mm
S0416	of chlorine and you just dump some sodium would it just turn into salt which be not what would happen the sodium would explode
S0417	oh
S0416	and
S0417	that would be pretty bad
S0416	yeah and it would be release chloride like chlorine or chloride
S0416	chlorine

S0417	partly her own experience
S0416	oh really
S0417	mm
S0416	oh do you want me to tell you what the book's about
S0417	in near her home town in nineteen thirty six when she be ten years old
S0416	well scout's
S0417	so if you remember those things you put that into your essay that will help
S0416	scout be scout be seven so
S0417	yeah but you remember these things so you put them to erm and what do it what's it about then
S0416	well it's about
S0416	it's about erm i don't know
S0417	how much have you read
S0416	i don't i i don't
S0417	one chapter
S0416	i know what it be okay i'm gonna say this fast
S0417	how much have you read
S0416	i'm gonna say this fast it's about a black man that rap someone and then atticus be defend this black man and people call him negro lovers
S0417	atticus finch
S0416	atticus yes
S0417	they describe it here as a southern
S0417	gothic novel
S0416	gothic
S0417	southern gothic yeah
S0416	why gothic
S0417	erm maybe cos it's gothic can sometimes be a bite dark can't it
S0416	doesn't sound dark to me
S0417	do you want me to look like press on southern gothic and see what that mean
S0416	er
S0417	i've do it it's a subgenre of gothic fiction that take place exclusively in the american south stop do that with teddy doesn't like have feet on him the common theme be
S0417	flaw or disturb or or eccentric character who may or may not
S0415	hello
S0417	dabble in hoodoo which be like a voodoo
S0417	and then like
S0417	derelict settings or sinister settings poverty or grotesque so it's that's what it mean
S0416	it's just
S0417	it's a little bite horror movie
S0416	there's a lot it's i don't think it's horror movie at all
S0417	no
S0416	i think it be it be set in poverty
S0417	yeah
S0416	i think i don't know what they mean by eccentric character
S0417	think be there a dark character in this it say sinister character
S0416	erm see i get quite confuse about this but i think there's a guy call boo radley that live in this house
S0417	yeah
S0416	and it's all dark and they try to spy in one and then
S0417	yeah and be it a bite decay then
S0416	i know i know i think boo radley come out and try to shoot at them but i really get confuse during that cos it be quite hard when people be read and they're not really the best at read and
S0417	mm
S0416	they don't really read right so it's quite hard to pay attention if you know what i mean
S0417	mm
S0416	like cos you're try to listen to them but you can't it's kinda hard to make out what they're say if they're like stop and pause
S0416	and not use full stop and things
S0417	do you know in some classrooms in america erm they erm some people want it take out of the classrooms
S0416	take what out
S0417	take the book out
S0416	why
S0417	cos it be expose racism i suppose that people didn't want to talk about
S0416	mm
S0417	only some classrooms but it they didn't succeed
S0416	mm yeah you know scout
S0417	yeah
S0416	she's a proper badass
S0417	have she you know have she erm have she write anything else the author
S0416	not that i know of
S0417	she's only just write another book all those years ago
S0416	oh
S0417	all those erm it's call go set a watchman style
S0416	ask me another question
S0417	question about the book
S0416	yeah
S0417	erm do you like it
S0416	i do
S0417	have you finish it yet
S0416	no or or like er book three part two we're on chapter just start chapter fourteen
S0417	okay
S0416	yeah i do like it i just find it quite hard to to to kind of figure out what's happen really like sometimes you get a bite muddle up like like what
S0417	no it's probably worth read again
S0416	like it take me it take me like it take me like a chapter or two to realise that scout be engage to dill
S0417	mm
S0416	cos like it be quite hard for me to understand i think i'm get it i'm get it more now
S0417	do you think that's partly because isn't it through the eye of a child so the children don't understand everything so you're like a bite confuse like the child would be
S0416	maybe
S0417	or be it just you that's confuse
S0416	i think it's just me er one one thing i really didn't like be when they shoot the dog
S0417	yeah
S0416	they have no idea it be rabid
S0416	like i mean
S0415	wanna go upstairs
S0416	they should've shoot the dog
S0416	because at that time they they you have to because in the small chance that it be rabid
S0416	it would've be a big deal and er the town might've all die
S0417	mm
S0416	so it's a big deal but nowadays
S0417	suppose they have to be careful though didn't they
S0416	yeah mm
S0417	do you think do you find it easy to read though
S0416	easy do you mean like easy to like read properly like full stop exclamation mark and things and the accent and things or
S0417	erm well just be it be it difficult do you find it difficult
S0416	do you mean to like read out
S0417	to just read
S0415	go upstairs just let's go
S0416	in my mind or what
S0417	in your mind yeah
S0416	no
S0417	mm
S0416	it take me a while to understand who be who and which name be who cos they all they all of the girls sound the same to me
S0417	yeah
S0416	i dunno i i didn't really know who miss maudie calpurnia or caroline be
S0417	yeah
S0416	but now i know like miss caroline's a teacher
S0416	calpurnia's the servant
S0415	let's go
S0416	things
S0417	do you know when do you know
S0416	oh yeah be calpurnia black
S0415	let's go
S0416	cos they go to a black church
S0417	i don't know it's age since i read it
S0416	and then lula be all like you ain't bring this white girl and boy over here
S0416	and then calpurnia's like well we'll leave then
S0416	and then the other one come up zeebo he take the mad dog away and he be like oh no you come back here you hear er and then they cos he be like be nice and say like you can stay don't mind lula
S0417	mm
S0416	that be good
S0417	so what do you think it's about what do you think it's try to tell you the book
S0416	that that it's quite a racist society
S0417	mm
S0416	and black people be quite automatically check as a no no and poor
S0417	mm
S0416	erm they're quite like i dunno if it's the right word but prejudice against white people
S0417	mm
S0416	and they might be
S0416	can't remember exactly oh no yeah i can keep talk if you want
S0417	think we have to do forty five don't we
S0416	no i remember exactly cos the first thing
S0417	yeah let's do it for a bite longer anyway
S0416	okay cos the first thing
S0417	just to be on the safe side
S0416	cos er on the on the dinner table we do thirty one minutes but i just count that as thirty minutes
S0417	cos i might have to take bits off so i might not be able to
S0416	and then and then
S0417	do the full one
S0416	and then we do twenty five minutes then it's thirty five minutes and then say he'd contribute ten euro instead of do like half an hour with me
S0417	so do you yeah so you think it be about racism be there any other like things that you think the book be about be about so so far
S0416	erm have a lot to do with america like in all the accent and like people call the y'alls and the
S0417	you know where it be in america don't you
S0416	yeah maycomb
S0417	and where's that
S0416	i don't know
S0417	that's in the
S0416	alabama
S0417	yeah do you know where that be
S0416	yeah yeah america
S0417	whereabouts in america
S0416	to the right i don't know
S0417	it's the southern state
S0416	oh yeah
S0417	that's quite important in a way why do you think that might be important
S0416	cos different area different way of think
S0417	uhu and do you remember the american civil war do you partly what that be about
S0416	black people
S0417	part of it be about slavery wasn't it and where do they where be most of the cotton field and where be most of the african slavery
S0416	south
S0417	yeah
S0417	yeah in the south state like for example where's the ku klux klan
S0416	i dunno i watch a documentary on them
S0417	do you
S0416	yeah
S0417	mm
S0416	it say they be nice people
S0417	do it
S0416	they be they be like no we don't we don't like kill black people any more
S0417	course that's alright then
S0416	and then the be like they be like on the news it be like these white people have like murder a black person in a horrific way and they be like oh that wasn't us that be that be a member of our group that we have not allow to do anything like that they do that out of their own will
S0417	yeah but they're feed into it by say it's okay to be to hate black people aren't they don't you think
S0416	mm he apparently he he like er he's like this black guitarist and he like him
S0417	who do
S0416	the leader of the ku klux klan
S0417	yeah but they i wouldn't like anyone in the ku klux klan because i think even if they're not do violence now they're they're they're happily be part of an organisation that that do murder black people and and they're happy to be associate with that it's not very nice it's like it's like be a member of a hate organisation really isn't it but yeah those be southern state so that's that's one of the reason why to kill a mockingbird be it's set in the place with the kind of there'll be place like the the author write it where she be bring up be probably pretty similar it's sad as well isn't it
S0416	mm
S0417	and also it's set at the time of the great depression do you know what that be
S0416	be it like a big recession that make everyone poor and poverty
S0417	yeah yeah so often things get more tense don't they at those sort of time
S0416	yeah
S0417	do you like read it though or be you just would you have read it if you weren't weren't ask to
S0416	i don't know i'm not really like a big fan of read really those kind of book i don't know why i just just can't really seem like i mean i i read captain underpants though read that fine
S0417	well captain underpants be alright isn't but i mean
S0416	i like i i don't know i think i just like have like a picture there or something
S0417	easier stuff
S0416	well it's not like i can't i mean i'm better than most of the people in my class say i'm probably draw with the best person if anything i'm the best
S0417	draw with it how do you mean
S0416	like there's no one really above my level in read so it's like i'm incapable
S0417	no
S0416	i just don't really not really a big fan maybe it maybe it be because you know i say i find it kind of hard to understand
S0417	mm
S0416	sometimes i think it's muddle up in my brain
S0417	yeah
S0416	with a picture it's a lot easier
S0417	would you go to see a film about to kill a mockingbird
S0416	yeah i'd love to
S0417	would you would want to wait do you think you need to wait until you finish the book first

S0416	i mean he's handsomer than me by far
S0417	er
S0416	he's taller than me
S0417	he's a bite
S0416	he do more he do more like sport and he hang out with like all the popular people which make him like rank two or one on like the girls' list
S0417	yeah but yeah but
S0416	i'd i i'd
S0417	they're not the girls you wanna be attract
S0416	like i'm i'm not even i'm not even attractive be i
S0417	you be attractive
S0416	well of course you're gonna say that mum
S0417	all my mat say it even though i know it's cringey
S0416	i don't really wanna
S0417	i mean obviously they know you're my son
S0416	they don't actually think i'm like actually handsome otherwise they wouldn't say it cos then it's just kinda weird
S0417	no they would cos that's what people say sometimes it's they all he's a really handsome son
S0416	see let's let's say let's say if i be a woman and then my woman friend have like a child it'd be oh he's so handsome i'd say that even if he be not handsome at all just to be nice and i and i know that that's
S0417	look you know some of your friends be probably a little bite overweight and that kind of thing that that unfortunately and it's quite hard
S0416	ah
S0417	it be hard to sort of but you're not and you're you be actually quite attractive
S0416	yeah
S0417	but but when we saw your mate
S0416	i yeah
S0417	i would say don't be don't feel any envy or any jealousy
S0416	
S0417	because yeah because when i saw when i saw both of them even without know that they know you i think they're a bite trashy
S0416	but like i have to kind of envy them in a way like he get all the girls
S0417	yeah but what girls do he get the girls who be a bite trashy
S0416	and he
S0417	and he's a bite trashy himself why would you want that
S0416	mm they're not no they're not like a bite trashy
S0417	they be they're a bite bitchy and horrible which be trashy in my book
S0416	well most most like
S0417	doesn't matter whether you've get money or not it's nothing to do with that
S0416	yeah but he can get the he can get the untrashy girls as well he can
S0417	well yeah but if he's
S0417	go here there and with
S0416	everyone everyone's his friend like no one
S0417	yeah but he be horrible to us in there so as far as i'm concern he's not a very nice guy at all
S0416	why be he horrible
S0417	cos he be a bite like oh he get your he get the girl to go hello he be just a bite he just look down his nose and that's not very nice that's not very nice at all like you're not a bite doesn't matter if you're popular and and you look at somebody i think there's something wrong because you're that popular then you can afford to be kind of afford at the very least to be courteous and nice can't you but if you look down on someone it's like just show actually you're just all you be be trashy that popularity be like be thin as paper because there's nothing behind it
S0416	would you say 's overweight
S0417	erm he's a big guy but i think he's he's he look healthy enough to not look like erm
S0416	i really don't
S0417	too overweight
S0416	i really don't know how doesn't have a six pack cos i mean in all fairness he deserve it more than me
S0417	mm
S0416	cos like he's he do a lot more sport and his dad's he have like a like a really healthy like drink every morning
S0417	mm
S0416	and like he be like yeah like have like really healthy stuff i mean like yeah and it's like and he do tae kwon do and stuff most weeks and he's be do it for years
S0417	yeah
S0416	and he's he doesn't have a six pack and if i'm be honest if i flex i i have a six pack
S0417	mm
S0416	if i flex if flex i don't think he's gonna have a six pack which i don't i don't really understand it maybe it's just cos i'm smaller and it's cos easier cos i'm smaller
S0417	i dunno you've always be quite fit and healthy so
S0416	i think a lot a lot of be actually muscle
S0417	mm
S0416	not all of it but a lot of his weight be because he be quite strong
S0417	yeah he doesn't look unfit do he so
S0416	no i dunno about and though
S0417	yeah
S0416	i don't think be very fit really to be honest
S0417	mm
S0416	like he he quit rugby to do soccer but i don't think he's very good at soccer and that's all he do he only do soccer
S0417	would you do soccer
S0416	no i i'll guess if i've be
S0417	less injuries though
S0416	mm
S0417	less injuries
S0416	yeah but like i wouldn't really like it
S0417	well you don't know i suppose you do you do like play football don't you

S0417	mm
S0416	er that aren't nice people
S0417	yeah i don't think their mum and dads be kind of aware of that really
S0416	and like he do a lot of photos like back from like just just for like if you know what i mean
S0417	mm
S0416	just so he can be more popular and i know that's not really
S0417	mm yeah
S0416	i know that's peer pressure
S0417	yes 's a nice guy isn't he but yeah i think there be i think some of their so what who be his friends be be it and that crowd or be it like er
S0416	er no it's he's not really popular
S0417	no i don't know
S0416	he
S0417	to be honest i don't really like
S0416	he hang around with the popular kid like get all the girls he's a year younger than me
S0417	yeah
S0416	they'd be get all the girls and whatever and hang out with and he's like super handsome and whatever
S0417	mm
S0416	and he tell me that that he like he he they do mock him like sometimes and he doesn't like it
S0417	what his friends
S0416	his friends
S0417	have he get any nice friends
S0416	he say i don't know like he's never say one like he say like oh he's like a concrete friend next time he'd be like oh he's just i hate then he'd be like and if if you're go back and forth with friends like that that mean there's something wrong with your friends
S0417	yeah
S0416	cos like he say that be cry about like about something that like say after he have just be horrible to
S0417	yeah
S0416	like might've be make like he they're hang out and there be girls there
S0417	yeah
S0416	and then he'd be like make fun of blatantly
S0417	yeah
S0416	in front of all the girls and everyone and might've be really embarrass so he might've say something back and then he go off and cry which isn't like i mean it'd be it'd be would be the victim if he wouldn't have say that but he do that on a day to day basis
S0417	yeah
S0416	and just kind of blow up
S0417	yeah mm it's a shame imagine if you and go to the same school
S0416	yeah
S0417	be hard wouldn't it if he be hang out with all the popular but not very nice kid
S0416	it would be cos we wouldn't be in the same group
S0417	yeah
S0416	cos like if i want to
S0417	yeah
S0416	anyone can get into the popular group if they want they're not gonna be truly popular
S0417	yeah
S0416	but they'll be in the group
S0417	yeah
S0416	many people be like that they tag along constantly
S0417	yeah
S0416	they they be arseholes
S0417	yeah
S0416	just so they can be popular
S0417	yeah
S0416	and they never be popular
S0417	kinda sell your soul if you do that though don't you
S0416	like i know i know i know i know many people that do that
S0417	yeah
S0416	and
S0417	i i wasn't in the popular group
S0416	yeah
S0417	amazingly enough i know you find that hard to believe
S0416	mm he try to get to a different kind of popular group
S0417	mm
S0416	like and and and it's quite weird because normally all the popular kid all pack up
S0417	mm
S0416	there be this other popular group just cos they're just like they be but i don't know why they're just in another group it's probably just cos they aren't really sporty
S0417	okay okay
S0416	and then try to get with them but he's not like really on the dark side if you will
S0417	mm
S0416	like for instance like he might be just like i'll go anywhere like just push me away and i wouldn't get angry i wouldn't be like oh he's a bully
S0417	mm
S0416	because i know why he's do it
S0417	yeah
S0416	he's try to be popular
S0417	okay
S0416	i'm just he's try to be popular really
S0417	yeah
S0416	and you can see it and if i'm be honest he's never gonna be popular really
S0417	yeah
S0416	he's just kind of on
S0417	it's better to be in your own tiny little gang or even just have one friend rather than be
S0416	yeah
S0417	at the bottom end of a popular gang
S0416	it really be
S0417	that's kinda that's like the worst of the worst isn't it
S0416	it really be i hate it i just kinda hard to to see it happen
S0417	all your friends seem really nice
S0416	yeah
S0417	seem really lovely really nice i can't imagine anyone else not want to be friends
S0416	be kind of in the turn stage
S0417	oh
S0416	like he he's in the stage where he's he be a bite jerky when he's
S0417	mm
S0416	in front of the popular people
S0417	yeah
S0416	but then when you're just on a he well he's jerky when he he be in front of anyone
S0417	yeah
S0416	but he's really he's nice and cool
S0417	yeah
S0416	when it's just you and him
S0417	yeah
S0416	which be kind of it's like stage two and in stage three you've lose it
S0417	yeah
S0416	so like he's
S0417	that's a good way of put it
S0416	i mean like he's in the stage and i don't know i it's gonna sound strange but be kinda act try to be a bite cooler when the girls come round he just want to impress them
S0417	yeah
S0416	and er just because like new people you know
S0417	yeah
S0416	and he's kind of not be himself to me
S0417	yeah
S0416	which show that he's gonna be like that but extreme
S0417	yeah
S0416	with the other people which he be also in stage two
S0417	yeah do you think you've be in stage two sometimes
S0416	i don't know i think in early primary school i be
S0417	yeah
S0416	i don't think i've be in stage two though i really don't
S0417	yeah
S0416	in in in like third fourth fifth and sixth year it's strange cos i don't think there be any popular group really all the popular group that we have i be in it
S0417	mm yeah
S0416	and i wasn't really trail behind
S0417	no
S0416	like but they weren't really that mean they be just
S0417	they be alright really weren't they junior class really
S0416	yeah right it kinda work like well okay put it like this they be all a bite mean at time
S0417	yeah yeah
S0416	but and none of them be perfect
S0417	mm
S0416	like get on my nerve especially
S0417	yeah
S0416	because he he he'd be so two face
S0417	also i know really flit though isn't he be he the like you be his best friend or
S0416	yeah
S0417	or you you be
S0416	like when we be try to play jenga he'd just
S0417	he's hard work
S0416	jump the table on purpose
S0417	yeah
S0415	be there a cunning reason in bed or
S0417	erm yeah he didn't have it this morning
S0415	oh can i just make now alright or
S0417	i think you're do i'm quite proud of you for not be in the popular gang to be honest i'd er it'd be horrible if you be a bite of a twat to be honest
S0417	sorry
S0416	yeah
S0417	do you know what i mean i just think er
S0416	i'm gonna make sure doesn't end up like that
S0417	yeah
S0416	i dunno how how to stop like how do you stop me like erm
S0417	you have to hope for the best i don't think you can stop stop anyone you have to sort of try and say look
S0416	like you can't say like don't really hang out with them can you
S0417	no but
S0416	cos then they're gonna wanna hang out with them
S0417	no
S0416	and they're gonna be unhappy with anyone else and they're always gonna try and be the popular guy in that group which be gonna make them arseholes
S0417	i suppose it's like with you i've try to just talk with you all the way through and if things come up i've try to sort of say sensible stuff but then it's always be down to you what you do and the choices you make so
S0416	yeah i think you have to teach we have to teach humble things
S0417	yeah
S0416	like to be humble cos like popular people aren't humble at all
S0417	yeah
S0416	like i'm i'm sure be a really nice guy he be a guy that be like in the basketball net i be like don't just call me like he say something about small or something i can't remember exactly
