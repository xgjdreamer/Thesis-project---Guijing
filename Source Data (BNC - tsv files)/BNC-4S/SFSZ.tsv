S0511	why have i get a unicorn on my front
S0513	yeah
S0511	just give it to me and say do you just say here's a unicorn or do you say something else
S0512	here's a pink unicorn
S0511	that's right
S0512	with wing
S0513	get wing yeah
S0511	mm and then i then we just have a conversation about whether or not unicorns have wing
S0513	they don't
S0511	no
S0512	we know
S0512	sorry
S0513	well they don't exist so
S0511	apparently they can fly they can fly but they don't have wing normally
S0512	no they can fly in fairy tales not mythology
S0513	mm good physics
S0512	cos they shit rainbows
S0513	oh yeah cos fairy tales be a more reliable
S0512	they shit rainbows
S0513	source than mythology
S0512	in fairy tales they shit rainbows
S0511	i'm sure they don't i'm sure there's no shit in fairy tales
S0514	probably not on the internet they shit rainbows
S0511	do they
S0514	yeah
S0511	so like it doesn't seem very just have a horn come out of your nose i mean nobody get excite about rhinoceroses
S0511	mm
S0514	there be other kinds of unicorn which be much more similar to rhinoceroses
S0513	well there aren't because they don't exist
S0511	mm what do you mean by that statement there be other kinds of unicorn
S0514	yeah
S0511	what then
S0514	like that unicorn i think be actually only a female unicorn
S0513	okay that's weird
S0511	what
S0513	that he know that
S0511	what what what make this one female the fact it's pink
S0514	well sort of
S0513	it would be white
S0514	but
S0511	right
S0514	there be other unicorns which i think be the male ones which be basically bull with enormous horn
S0511	bull with
S0514	really really big horn that go and stab elephants
S0513	okay
S0511	well like this but bigger
S0514	yeah
S0511	darling please try to behave properly
S0514	and then they get the horn stick in a tree and you can chop it off and hollow it out and if you put poison in it it change colour so you know that it's poisonous
S0513	gosh how useful
S0511	what what what book do this information come from
S0514	can't remember
S0511	okay i see and there other additional type of unicorn
S0514	probably
S0511	well so far you've only say male and female
S0513	be there one that's not make up
S0514	i dunno there might just be
S0511	well you do occasionally get deer that like
S0514	yeah with one horn
S0513	that's
S0514	yeah that doesn't count
S0511	do they shit rainbows
S0512	everything
S0512	shit rainbows
S0513	well it doesn't
S0512	but you don't admittedly but
S0511	so tomorrow erm 's go to go to granny's at quarter to three and get some new trainers and then help granny to transport the enormous amount of tea food back here
S0511	cos 's too lazy to be able to can you stop tap please
S0513	mm
S0511	lazy to be able to go to granny's house for supper
S0513	she offer
S0511	she do offer and she's very happy oh yeah talk of granny's offer erm i have make a decision about russia
S0512	mm
S0513	great
S0514	you don't know what it be yet
S0511	er keep everybody happy
S0513	yes i do
S0511	we be go to book to go to russia
S0513	so
S0511	and if doesn't want to come when it come to it he doesn't have to
S0513	ah
S0511	okay how do we all think about that
S0512	mm okay
S0511	you could think it's kind of extravagant
S0512	mm
S0511	and then between now and when we go we're gonna like go on and on constantly at about how he should come with us no we won't do that cos that would be bad
S0514	and wouldn't convince him
S0513	would you go on and on constantly about how cool russia be
S0511	how about that
S0513	russian people get kill there for be gay
S0514	people don't get kill in america for be gay
S0513	yeah
S0511	people get kill in england occasionally for be gay
S0513	not there's no point argue with you
S0514	also there be much more people in russia
S0513	well there aren't there's hardly any people in russia
S0514	there be a lot more than there be here
S0512	just a huge percentage wise
S0511	what isn't
S0512	per square kilometre there's a tiny population
S0513	per capita
S0511	i i be there that small population per
S0514	per square kilometre
S0513	well yeah because there's siberia where no one live
S0511	that's not true people do live in siberia don't raise your eyebrows at me can i have some more water so i think that be a compromise
S0513	mm
S0511	and therefore you should be happy can i have some water please erm and between then we'll yeah we'll show you the moscow state circus and then you'll come
S0513	mm
S0514	they have a state circus
S0512	with juggle bear
S0511	we weren't gonna mention the juggle bear to
S0513	juggle bear that's animal cruelty
S0514	they use to have juggle bear they don't anymore
S0511	they major in er in acrobatics and stuff like that no it seem like yeah the name can be apply to lot of things
S0513	they're probably all on drug
S0514	what
S0511	what the acrobats
S0513	or just the russians
S0513	you know russia's be ban from any athletics competition
S0511	be that gonna happen be that what happen in the end
S0513	probably yeah well that's what say
S0511	sound like you're say they're gonna ban then from next year's olympics
S0511	isn't it love would you like your minute steak cook for another minute
S0514	no not especially
S0513	then it'd just be steak
S0512	can i just shove my steak your steak down my gullet
S0514	steak
S0513	good
S0511	sorry
S0513	good one
S0514	no
S0513	it's not funny
S0512	can i have your steak
S0514	yes
S0512	woo
S0511	the mash be very nice no i'm alright on meat thank you
S0512	would you like some do you want some
S0511	i'll probably eat some of more of the
S0513	mm
S0511	mash granny say you can stay with her whilst we're away although i mean perhaps i'm sure daddy will be able to look after you while we're away so er
S0513	how long you go for
S0511	sorry
S0513	how long you go for
S0511	ten days
S0511	over the during the easter holiday
S0512	oh
S0511	and as i say you'll have a ticket too
S0513	mm
S0513	mm can you refund ticket
S0511	no but then we could just write granny's quite happy to just write off the cost
S0513	no because the ticket a plane ticket to russia doesn't cost nothing
S0511	no i know but we think that's a better plan than try a force you to go or b decide to go without you and then you change your mind and granny's very keen that with in particular that we go a we go now like this year or next year as it be because like the year after we won't be able to go away for long periods cos you you'll be do your gcses and stuff so you won't be able to go away for two weeks in easter then you see so this year and the same be you laugh at the concept of do his gcses er
S0513	er yeah
S0511	yeah but you'll be
S0514	why
S0511	do your finals for ib as well so we wouldn't be able to have two weeks off next easter
S0511	so so the time be very good to do it now
S0511	so aren't we fortunate
S0511	amaze
S0513	yeah it's cool
S0511	and and i buy a russian dictionary and a russian erm phrase book today
S0514	mm
S0511	didn't succeed in read anything out of it
S0514	mm
S0511	go on say some russian for us
S0513	vladimir
S0514	that might corrupt the record
S0511	what say vladimir
S0514	speak in russian
S0512	so
S0511	well yeah we don't need to worry about that too much we're allow to have our conversations
S0514	erm
S0511	i wonder what the person who's do the type think about whether or not should go to russia
S0514	mm
S0514	dunno
S0511	she'll he or she'll probably have quite a clear view on it by then
S0514	if one of us say an email address
S0511	they could email us the
S0514	yeah
S0511	no cos we don't want to like lose our anonymity
S0513	yeah
S0511	i think about erm i say to last night
S0513	oh no
S0511	shall we record ourselves talk but he didn't look very thrill and give that erm he's be an ex copper and stuff
S0513	mm
S0513	an ex undercover policeman
S0511	mm i mean i know well obviously yeah he do think erm not so much he doesn't think they need more gun or bigger gun
S0513	no shit he have more than five brain cells
S0511	but he do think that we need more police
S0513	really
S0511	well you know a lot fewer than they use to be
S0511	yeah
S0511	erm
S0513	but actual frontline police er we need people work out what when it's gonna happen
S0511	mm
S0513	before it happen
S0514	but it's the big problem and they we haven't really solve yet
S0511	and interest 's quite interest on this because erm he think that the kind of bobbies on the beat type people erm the people like you know people like have them even though they don't make any difference
S0514	yeah
S0513	yeah i know
S0511	but he think that that's really problematic not have those people because it that's how you meet people
S0513	yeah
S0511	and get low level intelligence and low level intelligence just know people lead to
S0513	yeah
S0511	know other people and whatever whatever
S0513	what do we not have those anymore
S0514	i think like local people
S0511	basically
S0514	actually have a better track record of stop terrorist attack than intelligence service do
S0511	yeah yeah i can believe that
S0513	mm
S0512	but you do need the intelligence service
S0511	to do some other stuff
S0514	probably yeah
S0514	but they really aren't that though just
S0512	no
S0511	well the thing be like we say when they say they've stop something we don't even know if it's true right so and i go to town like the other day i don't know if any of you have notice this erm buy him some clothe
S0513	great
S0512	er er
S0511	we buy two jumpers and a pair of trousers
S0512	er er
S0511	what do you mean er er
S0512	er
S0511	great
S0512	er
S0511	erm right so erm who's get more homework to do tomorrow
S0512	me
S0513	i've get some homework for maths i'll do that tonight and i've still get load of that english to do but i've get until like january so
S0514	mm
S0511	you've not do your elements and stuff yet
S0512	no
S0511	mm this this mash potato mixture
S0512	yes
S0511	even though it's get like warm crème fraiche in it cos in it
S0512	they're not chemically bond
S0511	aren't they
S0513	oh piss off
S0511	sorry
S0514	he say piss off
S0511	why
S0513	to
S0511	why
S0513	say use the phrase chemically bond
S0512	no that
S0513	like six time a day
S0511	well that's cos it's his homework
S0514	that's because it's his homework
S0511	do you not realise that's why we're have these conversations he's get that's his homework at the moment okay mm what about you homework wise you've just do brilliant news with english
S0514	yeah
S0513	be it really brilliant
S0511	yes it be
S0514	yeah
S0513	what be it about
S0514	perfume
S0513	be you analyse it or actually write a something else
S0512	he be write a sequel
S0514	we don't really do write a something else
S0513	what be you write mm
S0514	like stuff about stuff there be some question
S0513	mm be it all about perfume
S0514	yeah
S0513	or do you choose do you choose the book
S0514	no
S0513	no
S0512	er er er er er er er er
S0511	what be the question the scenes in which he be be
S0514	a tick
S0511	so be he actually a tick
S0514	no
S0513	what's a tick
S0511	right
S0514	it's a metaphor
S0511	a tick be like a
S0513	oh right
S0514	like a tick
S0513	yeah
S0511	not like a cross
S0512	tick be really bad for you
S0511	tick fever
S0512	mm
S0511	it's a er so have you get lot of other subject to do you must have some
S0514	mm not too much
S0511	thing that i be look at earlier there be all these things that be due in this many days that many days however many days
S0514	yeah i've do quite a lot of them
S0511	have you good you look like a constant stream of stuff
S0511	sweetie what have you have to eat darling
S0513	enough to nourish me for twelve hours
S0511	which what
S0511	which be three slice of carrot
S0513	three slice of carrot
S0513	not very much potato and a small cut of the meat banana in a minute
S0511	woo
S0513	mm
S0512	what do you say
S0511	so you say probably have a banana in a minute do you have anything when you be out with
S0513	no
S0511	do you go to a coffee shop
S0513	no
S0511	do you go anywhere indoors
S0513	no don't think so
S0511	yeah that would be pretty horrible erm you be like these carrots
S0514	mm
S0511	because they're cook
S0514	because carrots
S0511	oh okay
S0512	mm
S0514	mm
S0511	we go to into town so that could sort out the pin number on his bank card of which he now have two
S0511	but when we get there it turn out he hasn't actually receive any of the pin number yet so we be there pointlessly
S0514	i find interest program languages
S0511	oh yeah find another interest program language
S0512	oh that's so cool
S0511	erm er
S0514	mm
S0511	have you tell about it
S0514	and also one call ook
S0513	huh what
S0514	which be a language for orangutans it's just ook ook ook ook ook and the difference be in the punctuation
S0513	wonderful
S0511	er but what be these call er you say there's a wikipedia article about
S0514	there be a wiki on er esoteric program languages
S0511	esoteric program languages i like that
S0514	also whitespace which be pretty cool
S0511	what's that
S0514	it's the whitespace interpreter only recognise space tab and enter so you can hide it in any other body of text
S0513	i understand
S0512	that's really cool
S0511	okay
S0511	you both have to say i think that's really cool
S0512	yeah so
S0513	well i don't think it's really cool but i just understand it
S0511	okay think it's really cool
S0513	i think it's kind of obvious
S0514	mm
S0511	er can you explain to about that er language you be tell me about earlier
S0514	er there's one where instead of write out you make a picture and it start in the top leave hand corner look at the block of colour how big it be and what colour it be and move along and depend on what colour there be it do different things
S0513	mm mm mm what be this
S0511	sorry
S0513	woah
S0511	sorry
S0512	so do you think you could make one which would be
S0514	there's a turing complete program language that look like abstract art that be cool
S0511	that have you get
S0512	do you think you can make one
S0513	define cool
S0512	which make itself
S0514	well that be a point in make program languages that when you've write it to a certain point if it's not deliberately difficult to write and you start make the next version in the language
S0512	so if you make this and you press enter or whatever to start the code it would just keep reproduce
S0514	mm you could yeah
S0512	okay cool
S0514	that would be a fork bomb and it would eventually kill your computer
S0511	it would be a fork bomb
S0514	yes a process fork into two two more
S0511	oh and then again and again again
S0514	and then it use up memory until the computer just crash
S0511	okay
S0511	i be i be wonder if after supper can show us one of these picture that's a program language a program
S0514	mm
S0511	language thing
S0512	last year i be on hour of code which be really hilariously bad and i spend several hours on it
S0512	but the interest thing be that
S0513	yeah we spend like five weeks on an hour of code didn't we
S0512	like yeah
S0512	each lesson's an hour long
S0511	yeah
S0512	erm and we erm copy and paste and copy and paste
S0514	yeah
S0511	be you suppose to have an hour of code a week maybe
S0512	yeah but no i i get sixty million line of code
S0511	why
S0513	why
S0512	and then it crash the server
S0513	well that's not very surprise
S0511	why do you do that
S0514	well you should've implement safety for that
S0512	yeah and after that erm the server be so slow that you couldn't get any more than thirty million
S0513	when
S0511	yeah
S0513	you be do python last year
S0512	but everyone's computer be
S0513	i mean computer just say suck over and over and over and over again
S0511	so it's good that you use
S0514	and that be like the most basic program ever
S0511	you you use new technology to still be rude to one another
S0514	that's it's the the original program in basic
S0511	be suck
S0514	be twenty print hello
S0511	oh
S0514	ten print hello twenty go to ten
S0511	oh okay right so it go on and on and on
S0514	yeah
S0511	go to you see
S0514	mm
S0511	see go to that's how can you stop throw bits of wax around in fact can you stop throw things around
S0514	or if it be
S0514	if if it be more modern you'd say erm int main print hello main
S0511	right sort of i don't really understand
S0514	and that would run in c
S0511	repeatedly
S0514	er mm
S0511	erm how many line of code in that picture on dad's erm kitchen with the woman stand next to her code
S0512	mm
S0514	many
S0512	that's very
S0511	be that more than sixty million line of code in all those bits of paper
S0514	to be fair that's probably in cobol which take age to write anything
S0513	it be handwritten
S0514	when they say by hand it doesn't mean write out by hand
S0512	no
S0514	it mean there be no no previous code for it you have to make it yourself
S0511	you didn't just go and get it from that place that people get bits of code from what's it call that place
S0513	stack overflow
S0511	yeah stack overflow they're always talk about that in my place
S0513	cool
S0514	how's it go with the job interview
S0511	well i haven't have it since yesterday
S0512	so a line be each actual line
S0511	yeah
S0514	usually yeah that would be how it work
S0511	i suppose that's what a line of code be
S0514	yeah
S0511	yeah
S0512	so i doubt it
S0513	or until you finish the function and then you have to press enter so
S0511	yes so sometimes they're short sometimes they're short and sometimes they're long
S0514	yeah
S0511	yeah
S0513	oh right yeah i see
S0514	yeah you could but
S0511	cos even like a sentence be that you get the end of a thing
S0514	you could in theory write any program if it's not in whitespace or python all on one line
S0511	that you they're that's like like full stop it's er to make it easier to read
S0514	yeah
S0511	and to
S0514	and there be
S0514	endless debate about the best ways to do the indent
S0511	be there endless debate
S0514	except in python where it's not possible to do it except in one way
S0511	it's lovely that you've find that you're find such a lot of interest in this it's brilliant
S0514	mm
S0511	really really brilliant excellent
S0513	i agree
S0511	it be great what be you interest in
S0513	i dunno
S0511	nothing be that
S0513	i dunno
S0511	i dunno
S0512	i'm interest in butterfly object
S0511	yes but not butterfly
S0511	put the bloody thing down
S0512	i'm go to
S0511	you're go to throw what at him
S0512	throw this piece of metal at you
S0511	can we not throw things at each other
S0513	this battery
S0512	good luck with that one
S0511	do we
S0511	get to watch more doctor who then tonight as it's saturday
S0512	yeah
S0514	hooray
S0513	i'm do homework
S0511	i know you be cos you don't like doctor who
S0511	what time's it on
S0512	i think in an hour
S0511	what time be it now
S0512	quarter past seven
S0511	okay it feel like it's later
S0514	mm
S0513	right well my maths here i come
S0511	go on then your maths here you go can you have a look at what and do you actually wanna start something no
S0512	i wanna go and read
S0511	okay i wanna go and read too frankly
S0512	okay right
