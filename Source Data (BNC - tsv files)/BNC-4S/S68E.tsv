S0456	might be years
S0457	apparently like he's already get permission
S0456	yeah
S0457	have permission years ago
S0456	erm yeah i remember you be say that
S0457	er mm yeah
S0458	mm
S0457	so mm and apparently like erm 's grandad didn't even see the for sale sign
S0456	mm yeah
S0458	it weren't obvious be it
S0457	yeah no
S0458	cos like he didn't want to sell it
S0457	and then all of a sudden he he realise it be for sale
S0458	too little too late
S0457	and er he want to buy it it's too late it's go now
S0458	he be be funny the for sale sign be there for months
S0457	he he probably yeah cos it be it's not actually stick out it be
S0456	yeah yeah
S0457	it's flat on the window so if you
S0456	well even i notice it so
S0457	i know but he drive in the car doesn't he mr he's old
S0458	i've see him walk down the street before
S0457	me too
S0456	i see now he realise if i walk i might see any for sale sign
S0457	yeah too late yeah it's go mm never mind
S0458	no mm unless he can find out who's buy buy it and have a good
S0456	make a better offer
S0458	it's never too late be it
S0457	mm
S0456	mm yeah i think by the fire station they're build something because i saw them remember opposite you know the fire station and gym
S0457	yeah
S0456	and there's a bite of waste grind and the old ruin of a pub
S0457	oh i know yeah
S0456	and it be just always fence off
S0457	yeah
S0456	and just waste grind but today when i go pass they be dig it up so i think they're they're lay foundations
S0457	oh be they
S0457	i wonder what that's go to be
S0456	be more flats cos obviously they've get two row of flats
S0458	yeah
S0456	and then the new ones further down the road
S0457	yeah court
S0458	yeah mm
S0457	mm
S0456	yeah that be always a horrible spot anyway so
S0457	mm
S0456	kid throw stone at you just climb up before they put the fence round it
S0456	yeah and they say they we can't do anything about it because it's all the house be council house but the pub belong to whatever and then all the breweries et cetera change ownership
S0457	yeah
S0456	so nobody could trace who actually be in charge of the build and therefore could be make liable and i think either it be a change of law or if you can say that it's be not care for for so many years and the council can step in and that's when the put the fence up
S0457	yeah oh i see
S0456	but it take it take and obviously load of people must have complain
S0457	you walk down there with and you get do you do you someone throw something at you and
S0458	yeah two little shit they weren't even bother they be just chuck stone at us
S0456	yeah yeah
S0458	they soon bloody complain when we start throw them back
S0457	to them
S0456	well especially if you hit them
S0457	yeah
S0458	well not cos they'd be throw stone to hit us you know what i mean they should bloody get their aim better
S0456	mm
S0457	mm
S0458	yeah and they start swear at us then i say see you later have a nice day it wind them up more doesn't it though when you're not be nasty to them
S0457	yeah
S0456	yeah
S0457	mm
S0456	well as i say when once the fence go up that that seem to quieten down and it use to be a lot more you know the kind of stuff that i get throw at me be like the the worst one once be a pie

S0456	oh yeah
S0457	it bring all take all the dust and things like that erm he's get the hospital soon and i think he's really worry about it
S0456	what have he have he difficulty breathe at the moment
S0457	yeah he's get erm emphysema
S0456	oh
S0457	so your lungs have get like little sub things on it so all my dad's
S0456	which make your lungs basically have very small
S0457	yeah my dads have all die sort of thing so they want to cut the top of his lung off but then he's worry about go under anaesthetic the way he be erm
S0458	and be in hospital
S0457	yeah and be in hospital because if he catch anything he's get no immune system whatsoever now he can't really he walk from my mum's house to mine and then that's it he's gasp for his breath he come round the other day and he sit on the doorstep before you you can't speak to him because he's
S0456	he's out of breath shock
S0457	and it's awful because i mean he's work all his life and he have to buy his own nebuliser his own like breathe machine what he put his tablet it he have to buy that it's so wrong
S0456	yeah
