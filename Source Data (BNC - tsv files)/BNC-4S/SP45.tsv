S0652	well if there be one in the picture i take of you
S0653	there be a sort of glow bite shape in one of the photograph now tell the children about when you saw a ghost when you be little
S0652	which one
S0653	have you see more than one
S0652	mm
S0653	the monk at the end of the
S0652	oh
S0654	don't do that
S0653	don't do that
S0652	what
S0653	oh
S0654	i get that
S0653	because we be in a house in the middle of nowhere so don't spook the children come on then
S0652	but you want me to tell them a about a ghost that i've see
S0653	yes because ghost be not they be so
S0652	but you don't want them to get scar
S0653	well it's not a scary ghost be it
S0652	no it be just stand there
S0653	yeah
S0652	at the end of the drive
S0654	stand there
S0653	what's the other ghost you've see
S0652	mm
S0653	just stand just someone with a hood
S0652	well we use to have the family use to have a holiday home up in the yorkshire dales which be very remote and it be up the side of a massive mountain and there use to be an old monastery so a monastery where lot of monks stay and that be all derelict
S0655	what do derelict mean
S0652	fall apart
S0653	a ruin
S0652	so erm you have to go through about three field and then there be in each field at the begin and the end of a field there be a gate and you have to get out of the car and open the gate and let the car through and close the gate it be quite fun because we use to ride on the back of the car when we be young so the last gate be at the bottom of the drive and the drive be quite long to go up to the house it be about fifty metres to go up to the house and then there's a kitchen window that look out and one time i saw this hood figure from the window who be stand at the end of the drive and there be like no one else around so it be in the middle of nowhere and there be this hood figure at the end of drive and i say to mummy mummy there's a man there's a man here she say what do you mean there's a man and we look and it be go but there be no like you couldn't see anywhere else
S0653	he be hide crouch down i reckon
S0652	it be not hide
S0652	that's a ghost because my then my grandma saw a ghost she wake up and she saw this figure at the foot of her bed she go he go aye and then my grandad be he suddenly snore next to her and she be like and then that one disappear as well i reckon it be the same ghost
S0655	i know i know erm how ghost can disappear so quickly
S0652	because they be a figment of our imagination
S0653	yes yes
S0655	no because they be non solid they can sink through anything even if there be something solid in their way they can sink into the grind and then once the car have pass they could go up
S0654	do you think
S0653	yes definitely
S0652	i've see some pretty pretty good footage in the nineteen seventies poltergeist footage really there's no
S0654	be poltergeist be poltergeists invisible
S0652	mm
S0655	yeah they all around they could be all around us
S0655	for all we know
S0652	i'm go to check my colgate toothpaste see if see if the ghost have use it
S0652	mm it be definitely medieval ghost because he would be like oh this toothpaste might my stump be so shiny
S0653	i be go to say they don't they don't have any teeth anyway
S0652	no
S0655	the ghost might want to go and then all go and he will go
S0653	well you see if they have a a fill in their teeth and then it just hurt and then they have to take the teeth out
S0652	mm
S0653	so you know you be go to have your fill do in a couple of weeks' time
S0655	well i might but it might fall out by then
S0653	well i doubt it
S0652	a tooth be it a baby tooth
S0653	it be a baby tooth yeah
S0652	crumb
S0653	i know i know
S0652	a fill in a baby tooth
S0653	only a tiny hole but it be not bother you at the moment i mean i think it be pointless however i guess if it start to hurt you then it's best to prevent it isn't it the fill
S0655	yeah but still it be go to hurt more than it be go to hurt me well it's go to hurt more with the fill than it be hurt me now
S0653	at the moment but if it get bigger the thing be because you can't sort of clean it properly you can get infections in the hole and all sort of things so that's why that's why the do it but some of my teeth be mostly fill anyway
S0652	mm
S0653	if i have lot of money i would cap them
S0652	oh so would i what like veneer
S0653	no fisherman's cap they be call where you put a white or cream coat on them on the metal fill
S0652	oh
S0653	so it just look like a tooth if you just bite into your lolly stick
S0654	spit it out
S0653	take it out why be it still in your mouth it might have splinter
S0654	idiots
S0653	why why do you bite it take it out it's get splinter on the top
S0653	you'd like veneer well i'd like i'd like my teeth whiten as well
S0655	mum
S0654	look you be go to get a splinter on your tongue
S0655	i've get your problem solve
S0653	just have massive prawn crackers instead of teeth that would look nice
S0652	prawn crackety and everything you bite into would go
S0653	that would be nice
S0655	i know you be
S0653	perhaps i'll tippex my teeth
S0654	what do tippex mean
S0653	tippex be a white liquid that you put on document if you've make a mistake
S0652	but you not allow it at school any more be you
S0653	be you not
S0652	no
S0653	probably not well people in the office have it so if i've make a mistake on a document okay and it be only a tiny error and i want to photocopy it then rather than print out the whole document i would use the tippex to tippex it out and then that error would be go so when it get photocopy you wouldn't be able to see that mistake it do smell though so lot of silly people at school use to sort of sniff it and get all excite about it and mess it up you know pour it over their text book and stuff
S0655	why
S0653	because teenagers be silly sometimes
S0654	if they do pour all over their text book then the teachers would go why do you put it on your text book
S0653	well it kind of obviously it dry
S0652	that's why it get ban
S0653	i would imagine right you can eat that chicken ball if you like because be not go to eat it
S0652	okay can i have another milky mini milk
S0653	after that if you've get room yes you two have be eat like there's no tomorrow what be you do
