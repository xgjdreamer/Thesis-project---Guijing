S0525	about whether the cover's break they just want something return and apparently on the back of the sales sales receipt

S0615	well
S0614	it's the same you might as well send it all
S0525	it sever through the
S0614	anyway
S0525	crossways through it
S0615	yeah but it only have a little bite of a blade on it didn't it it's not like it's massive
S0525	well even so it's still a still a blade that's

S0615	where's all her money i think i mean even though you know me and ever get into any trouble the last thing i would ever want to do be have to ask somebody else i mean i know we'd we'd have help you know
S0525	what you know mummy here would fork out
S0615	at the drop of a hat
S0615	but if you know obviously we've get him but that be the last thing that i'd ever want to have to happen

S0525	yeah of course you would
S0615	you know
S0525	especially like me and especially if you're diet
S0615	yeah
S0525	it's even more reason to scoff an egg
S0615	i know i just don't want him to have too many cos by the end of easter to now we'll have all of it go
S0525	right so a little a little egg then
S0615	yeah he's he won't have anything big
S0525	no no
S0615	don't bother i might give
S0525	well he's
S0615	give him his now just so he can
S0525	start it
S0615	yeah
S0525	it's only
S0615	cos he take age to get it
S0525	i've spend a lot of not a lot but you know obviously more than an egg
S0615	more obviously
S0525	the present's really for six months plus but it'll be alright you know the shape sort of thing
S0615	oh okay
S0525	probably leave it round here
S0615	yeah
S0525	so you've get to be sit up a bite but you be play football yesterday so we be move on
S0615	yes move on to bigger and better things
S0525	and he's good at football
S0615	he be sit earlier obviously not by himself but he be sit quite well i be just kind he be sit against my leg he be
S0525	do you have to take that the bumbo
S0615	the bumbo
S0525	back
S0615	no not yet
S0525	next week and you get it for two weeks do you
S0615	yeah
S0525	have he sit in it much
S0615	yeah sit in it a few time
S0525	yeah
S0615	it's difficult because we're out a lot in the day and then in the even it's like oh he's too tire
S0525	bite tire yeah cos you've gotta he's gotta hold himself up properly hasn't he
S0615	mm i'm look at get a like a bouncer like i know it sound stupid because the one we've get be really nice and it look really nice
S0525	who be that off
S0615	and
S0525	oh right
S0615	erm but it's just like you put him in it and he even i'm think even when he be six months even when he be a bite bigger he he's like it's not he's not strap in so we won't be able to
S0525	yeah
S0615	bounce around and he's gonna be do this
S0525	yeah yeah yeah have you
S0615	so i want one
S0525	so have you see just the very simple
S0615	yeah that's what i want
S0525	yeah a simple
S0615	and we've there's one from amazon from for for about twenty five quid
S0525	oh as much as that
S0615	and it's the same that i have i think when i be little and it's like the bar across and then you've get the two things that come out and
S0525	that's right yeah yeah
S0615	one of them
S0525	that's it and you just er

S0615	it's not that much so erm yeah i think i'll get him one of them
S0525	yeah cos they do all these fango dango super duper ones but
S0615	yeah which i think you could probably
S0525	all you wanna do be bounce in them
S0615	yeah yeah yeah which to be honest if i would have buy him one myself i would have go for one like that but
S0525	mm
S0615	because it's a present and he do
