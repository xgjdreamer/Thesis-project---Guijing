S0688	i think you could have it on in the background
S0689	no i on on some of the last record it's like it's quite loud so
S0690	buje there be er there be a market there but not this not today i don't think
S0687	you want to go to that groznjan as well
S0688	yeah be that up there
S0687	yeah that's that way
S0690	you you didn't wanna go there now do you
S0688	i don't know where now or whatever i wonder what that one be up on the hill there
S0687	yeah
S0688	maybe that's it
S0687	i think it's a little way up there
S0688	what rovinj
S0687	rovinj yeah
S0690	well what's there be that another hotel be it
S0688	yeah i think so isn't that where be no
S0690	no
S0687	past buzet
S0688	yeah
S0689	so if like if piece of art be worth like like from people we haven't hear of be worth like four grand now it's well er it's a bite of a silly question i be gonna say how much be like the mona lisa and the scream and all the famous art
S0687	yeah
S0689	i mean really see how do you how do you like you know why be they worth millions that's a very very nice car erm why they're worth millions but you know it's all that
S0688	i suppose the more famous the artist be the bigger the figure for his work but i don't know how i mean banksy's work how do you be it not just the how he operate that that increase the value of his work
S0689	probably
S0688	you know the fact that no one know who he be and
S0689	i can't believe but like nobody's ever
S0687	he have an agent who he work through
S0688	how do he first come to sort of say i'm banksy but i'm stay anonymous
S0687	don't know
S0689	so i'm sure his agent must know who he be
S0688	must do
S0689	let's hope they never fall out cos that's a
S0688	yeah i'm sure he's get clauses write into er his contract
S0687	you should overtake
S0689	see all those like little watchtowers
S0688	what's that
S0689	there's a little wooden thing there
S0688	by the side of the road
S0690	yeah i've see a few of those
S0687	in the field yeah it's we er it look it look like the ones you know that be like when you see in film around concentration camp
S0689	yeah
S0688	do you see those that's what i be the word i be think of those little pot do they call them
S0687	no idea what store pot
S0688	that we saw in the field
S0687	oh i don't know
S0688	where d'you get that from
S0690	i think they're shepherds' huts aren't they some of them
S0687	that's what i think they would be hey i'm really tire now
S0688	close your eye love
S0689	what do that sign mean with the little arrow
S0689	be it across
S0690	the road leave and right there road
S0689	oh suppose you never really see that in the uk do you you can never be well i suppose
S0688	there's a river just up there to the leave
S0690	yeah
S0688	what's that there's a cycle path there they have make hay er haven't they
S0689	why when do they usually do it in the uk
S0688	it's usually a lot later on in the summer whoop
S0689	like when
S0688	like august
S0689	august
S0688	yeah
S0689	like i say though it's probably yeah i be gonna say all the you know even when you be talk about that plant earlier it's probably genetically different to the plant we have
S0688	yeah
S0689	you know it's still a lavender plant but it's genetically different
S0688	but mine don't survive
S0689	yeah cos i mean it make sense that erm a lavender plant that er that's a pretty cool
S0688	yeah
S0689	erm that a lavender that be grow in croatia have to survive hotter summer than it do in the uk which make it harder wear and then gradually over time and like natural selection the lavender plant just you know
S0688	evolve
S0689	yeah almost i mean if you think about it if you if you think about how natural selection work the strongest survive while the rest die and then the strong pass on their genes to the next thing so you know say 's get the gene that allow him to survive an extra day without water and i've not get that gene and i'm gonna die first mean then can do you know the little pollinate thing you know that you know what plant do don't you
S0688	yeah
S0689	and then the you're everybody else have get that gene and it take thousands and thousands of years but
S0688	they look exactly the same don't they
S0689	i know but i don't know that's the only that be the only explanation i can think of wanna watch sons of anarchy as well when i get home that be a good series enjoy that
S0688	i can't think what that's about
S0689	biker gang in california
S0688	have you watch the whole thing
S0689	i watch the first like two season i think it be really really good
S0688	oh that be a straight road
S0689	yeah bite like america that isn't it they have really straight roads
S0688	yeah but do you know i be think that route 66
S0689	it say it in that book and i remember tell me you know in like the southern state erm so like school stop like a month early to just for the harvest basically cos children have to work on the ranch and you know the farm
S0688	oh
S0689	and erm er you can get a drive licence as young as like i think it be fifteen or maybe fourteen i can't remember it might have be fourteen erm and it's call like an early licence or something and basically it mean if you have if you be drive and you have farm relate material in the back of your trunk you're allow to drive on your own so if you have a lamb in your back or some fee you're allow to drive anywhere so basically so long as you have something farm relate in your trunk then you're absolutely fine which mean you can legally drive by the age of fourteen or fifteen i can't remember which one it be
S0688	wow
S0689	which be like pretty pretty crazy when you think about it isn't it well it
S0688	it be really
S0689	it be especially crazy see as what you can't drink until you're twenty one but you can drive a car when you're fourteen fifteen
S0688	and how old do you have to be to have
S0689	er again i i bet it vary by state by state but i don't i don't know about that one i'd guess eighteen but you know if you're do farm work then
S0688	's asleep
S0689	be she there's another there be it
S0688	no i dunno but it say
S0689	no it say
S0688	okay
S0689	k o l o
S0688	i think i'm sure that work then this be where we're go to be that no
S0689	do quite like the audi suvs
S0688	hgvs
S0689	audi suvs
S0688	oh okay so it doesn't look like they need to wait a long time all them tree before you get the crop on it
S0690	no well i think they have to mature but i couldn't see any grow on those tree opposite us
S0688	no maybe
S0690	and that i dunno what sort of crop you get off every tree like i suppose it depend how old it be how big it be but well it must be enough to make it worth his while
S0689	you're a very noisy breather sorry
S0688	it's get
S0689	sorry what be that
S0688	someone have pizza

S0690	i don't really know how you tell the difference between you know
S0688	i know
S0690	different qualities to be honest with you

S0690	well you say that but then this truffle oil you be gonna make presumably gonna be able to taste that difference i'd have think
S0687	i presume
S0690	so you just plonk it in do you or do you put shave of it in or what like
S0687	you don't plonk the entire truffle in
S0689	well i think
S0687	i think i think i think you shave it
S0688	i think you can
S0690	do she then plonk it in an
S0688	no she
S0688	oh
S0690	honey honey be it
S0688	that be the honey i think you can put shave in and then freeze the rest of it she say
S0688	eh
S0687	well she say she she say as soon as it's like a mushroom it only last a couple of days so she say freeze it and then when you need it just take some shave and then shove it back in the freezer
S0689	it's a weird tower that
S0690	it be isn't it
