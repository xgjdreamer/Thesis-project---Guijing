S0144	and here we be crawl through the undergrowth in search of a greater spot dawn there she be sit by the fire
S0024	steam
S0144	huh
S0024	it's like a steam thing
S0144	yeah
S0024	ah it's boil have you try oh god
S0144	it's silly cos i'm wear erm clean clothe as well these be go to stink
S0024	why be you wear clean clothe to do garden oh
S0144	shall we sit over the other side the wind's blow this way
S0024	well it's not at the moment but it will be yeah yeah which ever way i sit on the fire the wind follow me
S0144	huh
S0024	i think i'm jinx
S0144	yeah it tend to do that doesn't it
S0024	sit on this hill bite
S0144	yeah
S0024	i be think about my pond again cos that willow oh it's such a shame i wasn't here when that willow tree grow or that we hadn't be to that place in india where they have the willow bridge
S0144	yeah
S0024	cos erm
S0144	yeah you could have bend that over couldn't you
S0024	oh god when it be when it be grow when it be a baby look it even want to go that way it's lean that way already
S0144	that's willow be it
S0024	i well it's a weep willow i don't know if that work i think what you need be one of those twisty windy ones
S0144	right so if you bury that on the other side it would grow
S0024	i think it will root
S0144	it will root
S0024	i think it will root yeah well i don't know about that willow i know other the other willows do
S0144	huh
S0024	that would be cool it would be like a little art thing as well and it's in exactly the right place
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah it's funny isn't it
S0144	why
S0024	it's a shame i be wonder if dad cut it right the way down see what's happen to those tree over there
S0144	mm
S0024	they just start sprigging around it's not dead but they just start new sprigs and then maybe we can twist it and wind it and make a bridge
S0144	mm mm
S0024	if i would i would do that
S0144	that would take years though wouldn't it
S0024	no i don't think it take that long for that tree to grow well it would do from to make a sturdy bridge
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah of coarse it would oh it would have be so cool it's just in the perfect place
S0144	hmm
S0024	god my face be roast i think i've burn my face off
S0144	it's hot here actually it's look a bite red
S0024	it's good it's like a sauna isn't it open up all your pore i'll go and like splash it with cold water now to like get get in all the pour
S0144	yeah i love watch fire
S0024	i think do dad say anything i think we should watch it till it go down or until it's ready for potatoes or something
S0144	put potatoes in it
S0024	i don't know mum want to cook fish pie but
S0144	erm well i think it will be fine like that
S0024	well i think
S0144	it's not go anywhere be it it's burn off all the stuff
S0024	well i'd rather not i don't i don't want any piece at the edge to catch and then the grass all go and then we'll end up with a right old state i'm not to be blame for that so i'm sit here
S0144	okay
S0024	i'm go to sit until my fire be finish i feel like a right farmer look with my fork in my hand fork in my hand
S0144	you look like one what's that on your lace
S0024	no that's just the lace they just all break
S0144	oh
S0024	they've all come apart for some reason that's the inside of it look like don't know it look all fluffy look at that pond
S0144	yeah why why hasn't the water take to this why do it just drain
S0024	don't know oh maybe because it
S0144	cos it's clay isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	i think clay be suppose to hold water
S0024	yeah that's what we think when we dig it it's all clay soil around here i don't know and mum and dad they paddle be it paddle it you know like like you do with grapes but you do with a bottom of a pond
S0144	oh i don't know
S0024	paddle it poddle it
S0144	poddle it
S0024	i don't know pondle it no you know they get their wellies and they like squelch it around to try and make a seal with the with the clay
S0144	yeah and it hasn't work
S0024	it doesn't want to take but it it be get a little bite more water every year but maybe it's cos of the drought
S0144	what half a half a centimetre
S0024	hm well there be quite a bite in there the other day
S0144	be there
S0024	when we have all that rain yeah
S0144	yeah but he's get a hose lead from the runoff as well
S0024	yeah
S0144	so that's why it's get
S0024	yeah what the runoff off the shed yeah
S0144	i suppose if he keep burn stuff in it it's gonna create a seal isn't it
S0024	but it you've get to think oh i don't know be that why he's do it
S0144	that's the idea that's that's why he's burn it i think so
S0024	but what about that part of it
S0144	well i don't know well i think he's go to move onto that bite he say
S0024	oh i didn't know that's what why we always have our bonfires here because we use to have our bonfires there
S0144	yeah it make sense though doesn't it
S0024	i just think it be a nice place because it it be all indent in the thing
S0144	well that as well
S0024	i don't know
S0144	hmm
S0024	oh we should get some frog and stuff here though hopefully
S0144	mm
S0024	do you know i spend i i shape this pond i like i be they say if you want a pond you're go to have to dig erm an outline
S0144	mm
S0024	for it
S0024	so i dig the the outline and i say i want it like this with a little bridge go across there that be my my i have to draw a you know what mum and dad be like i have to draw up plan and everything this be what i'm go to do
S0144	mm
S0024	here this be what it's go to look like i do all of that then i then i dig all the way around the outside of this this be the shape and then dad bring the digger in
S0144	mm mm
S0024	and we find the end of the hose pipe right there it be perfect that we could just just get cos erm yeah the runoff from the shed the hosepipe be actually underground and it come all the way up to here
S0144	the hose be underground
S0024	yeah cos we use to have the goat shed there until they all burn down
S0144	yeah
S0024	they all burn down so we have water
S0144	oh okay
S0024	from i think it be from the
S0144	ah
S0024	from the dairy come down to fee the goat shed
S0144	yeah
S0024	and so there be a a hose pipe underground there and we dig the pond just in the right place and we find the end of the hose pipe it be really lucky
S0144	ah that be lucky
S0024	and it be like this be fate this be what this be what the where the pond should be but alas it doesn't want to be but anyway yeah and then and then we bring in the digger to dig out the rest but i'd dig it take me take me months every weekend and i be only like fourteen or something
S0144	oh mm hmm
S0024	actually no i think that be the i think that might have be the summer that i be ground when i be sixteen actually i think it might have be the summer i be really i be ground so i be here and i wasn't allow out all summer so i have nothing to do but try and dig a pond
S0144	hmm mm
S0024	that be exit summer wasn't it sweet sixteen
S0144	mm i think i spend the summer when i be sixteen down the golf course drink cider
S0024	well that's why i be ground that's why i have to dig a pond
S0144	yeah i know
S0024	it's funny isn't it what you use to do
S0144	yeah do kid still do that now
S0024	yeah in the park
S0144	i never notice it
S0024	that's cos you never go around the park late at night you wouldn't want to go like you just avoid them don't you you're like oh god i'm not go to go in there
S0144	mm yeah i suppose
S0024	like bless them they're only like a bunch of kid hang out most of the time they're not bad kid most of the time but i mean yeah maybe they're have a drink or a smoke or something like that but
S0144	well yeah it be only because i didn't have anything else to do
S0024	yeah

S0144	you need a mattress
S0024	it's massive isn't it
S0144	it be they should do something with this what could you do in here cos it's like completely secret isn't it
S0024	it's a storage truck
S0144	it could be they could grow some weed in here if you get the light
S0024	mm i don't think they would want to
S0144	it could be er some big norfolk producers
S0024	drug bust well what do you reckon do you want to sleep in there
S0144	that's brilliant that be er i don't know what do it look like in summer because you've get all of this stuff on top of it be it it look like it's go to collapse
S0024	why would it collapse
S0144	well the weight of all that stuff foliage on top
S0024	no
S0144	no
S0024	no
S0144	well i suppose it's be there how many years it remind me of those er temples in angkor wat angkor
S0024	yeah
S0144	with all the plant and tree grow out of them
S0024	mm it's cool isn't it i remember put this here
S0144	huh
S0024	if you see on the side that's where we paint let's see which van be this
S0144	this use to be the health food van
S0024	yeah the fruit and vegetable van see if we cut off that other side then they'll only be one secret pathway for over there and maybe we could just keep that for ourselves
S0144	you've get secret pathways everywhere there you go what do that say
S0024	it say furnish
S0144	furnish
S0024	i don't know why it say furnish
S0144	well it's an old furniture truck isn't it
S0024	i think it be an old library van the other one be an old library van
S0144	yeah alright well you've get so one three four five six here
S0024	anyway yeah but it like you say it's bumpy
S0144	and then we're go to have to light up around the pond
S0024	but like you say right look nobody can pitch a tent here look
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's too bumpy
S0144	mm er that bit's okay though isn't it
S0024	i think so right
S0144	look
S0024	you could even fit there's a flat bite there one
S0144	it be a bite bumpy isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	mm the whole garden's like that though
S0024	well i don't know what we're go to do
S0144	how far do your garden go do that
S0024	just to there that's the end this be the end and the potter who live over there she walk through sometimes with her dog doesn't she there's the owl box
S0144	yeah yeah cos he have to cut those
S0024	gosh you know that's an actual pathway now
S0144	that be a pathway yeah
S0024	because they've walk it so many time
S0144	i've i've never see her come through i saw her last year
S0024	have you not
S0144	be that her workshop
S0024	yeah but apparently her daughter and her daughter's husband have move in with a new baby yeah half the workshop be their house now
S0144	oh really
S0024	yeah and they seem the same age as us
S0144	oh
S0024	don't know why we've not be introduce really
S0144	yeah cos that owl box you have to cut all the tree down in front of it because the owls need er like a runway otherwise they won't take to it
S0024	really
S0144	yeah so that that bite of branch hang down there be probably stop one from move in
S0024	oh i see
S0144	because they come in like a plane and they need
S0024	well i could get oh it's just too high isn't it
S0144	yeah
S0024	you need the ladder what you reckon that branch be stop their runway
S0144	huh
S0024	just that little one there
S0144	er no this one here
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah that one
S0024	yeah oh i'd love an owl to move in i hear one the other day though and it sound really weird so
S0144	mm
S0024	right do you reckon this fire be do now
S0144	i reckon that will be alright
S0024	yeah
S0144	but i don't know what to do about these tent it depend how much people drink really isn't it
S0024	do you think we should email everybody and say look it's not particularly flat land do anyone want to reconsider should have put it in the invitation
S0144	no
S0024	oh they they'll have to just
S0144	it will be alright god you can rough it for one night can't you
S0024	yeah but some of these hole in the land be incredibly bumpy
S0144	i mean if they didn't want to stay in a tent they would have get a bed and breakfast anyway it's only the people that don't mind sleep in tent that
S0024	oh that just fell over what be that
S0144	well cos we've get all that down there as well to the hill that we could use
S0024	well like you know all those twig aren't there i suppose
S0144	yeah twig you can move those that's fine it's bump in the grind that be more problematic
S0024	mm
S0144	cos we can go all the way down there to the allotment
S0024	yeah and the allotment will have to be close off
S0144	yeah that will all be close off for the kid but the kid will all disappear at what eleven o'clock twelve o'clock

S0144	they do
S0024	be they
S0144	it's just the colour
S0024	i don't know
