S0514	well i guess
S0511	i be tell that in your absence they've arrest a fourteen year old boy for that hack on talktalk
S0512	really
S0513	fourteen
S0511	mm
S0512	lol
S0511	i'm glad you find that funny
S0513	well
S0512	well
S0512	it's a fourteen year old boy
S0513	nine billion nine billion land point
S0512	yeah that's gotta be
S0514	i wonder if it actually be erm
S0511	well they're say they've now arrest another a sixteen year old in london
S0514	mm
S0512	lol
S0511	they arrest a few days ago and they haven't say oh no it's alright or anything
S0514	there be a fairly young person who have the ex director the cia's email quite recently
S0511	mm
S0514	just by call up aol and impersonate them
S0511	mm which you would
S0514	mm
S0511	well
S0513	it's not hack be it
S0511	and there be there be also
S0514	that's a bite part of hack
S0511	the there be the erm well it's quite a young boy who's be charge with terrorism in australia isn't it as well i don't know whether
S0513	what's he do
S0511	it be hack that be terrorism they be plan to bomb a anzac day parade and i think he be sixteen
S0514	oh be that the one where they be go to try to try and encrypt all over it again
S0511	what's crypting
S0514	cryptography
S0513	no that
S0514	and there be a whole fuss about how his texts be encrypt
S0513	no it be in it be at an islamic state
S0511	thing
S0513	thing
S0511	erm actually but on that subject i when i be run this morning i hear this really er it well think provoke i think conversation on the radio about whether or not erm basically phone should be lockable so that even manufacturers can't unlock them
S0514	oh yeah cos apple say they actually can't
S0511	they actually can't unlock them
S0514	get into people's iphones on demand
S0511	and this man who be like a police officer be say er we have to be able to we you know just like we can now we don't normally break into people's house but if we need to go in there for good reason we get a warrant and we can go in so therefore it have to be the same on phone
S0512	that's
S0511	well that's one way of look at it but
S0512	mm
S0511	but he also like
S0511	what there be
S0511	there be things in the world that be secret like what go on in my head or a conversation that and i have that nobody else hear
S0513	mm
S0511	there be no way the police officer could find out about that and he can can't find out about my thoughts and that's also alright
S0514	mm
S0512	yes but because they're police they'll
S0513	mm
S0512	only do it when need it's just extra information
S0513	there's another problem
S0512	oh you're so trust
S0513	in that if say
S0512	well yeah exactly but
S0513	if apple have build in a way to get into their phone someone else who's a criminal will discover it and will exploit it
S0511	well that's one thing that they they call it a back door the expression be
S0514	yeah
S0511	and so say you have a back door and put padlock like a er on it and there's only one key and you give the key to the government that basically none of us think the government be gonna be capable of look after the key and then
S0514	yeah
S0511	remember where it be
S0512	that's true
S0511	when they need it so i think that in itself if the if the process be to do something like that er you'd just think well that's never gonna fuck work
S0512	they should make
S0514	yeah
S0512	one when they need it and then delete it
S0513	that still mean the company that make it have to have a key
S0511	mm
S0512	they can delete the key though
S0511	yeah but once you've get something
S0514	i think the
S0511	they'll you'll find it again
S0514	someone have to be able to produce the key and if someone can then anyone else can
S0511	and so the well the choices we've get be really really really completely secure stuff like there's well kind of the where we're end up and that
S0514	mm
S0511	and also enable people to trade and do onliney stuff whereas if i didn't trust my phone to be able to do the bank with or whatever then
S0514	mm
S0511	er leave aside trust the police so it's kind of quite think provoke
S0514	yeah
S0512	mm
S0511	i don't yeah i don't know what the answer be i mean i obviously i don't mind the police be able to get a warrant if they think they wanna come into my house
S0514	yeah
S0511	but it's
S0514	not if you're a criminal
S0511	actually quite a big philosophical but if they want to record all my conversations with just in case i'd object to that
S0514	yeah
S0512	yeah
S0511	mm tricky it's quite nice viennetta isn't it
S0513	mm yeah
S0511	i might have another slice will you me another slice just a slice of viennetta
S0512	same size or
S0511	mm one the same i imagine two small ones be better than one big one what puddings do you have on camp anything you like
S0512	no
S0511	no
S0512	there be
S0511	no
S0512	quite a bite of fruit though so
S0514	quite a bite of food
S0511	do you think it's because they do the same business about the recipes be always the same size if they're for a hundred or
S0514	yeah

S0512	yeah
S0511	the line be here i i understand but it could have be here
S0514	or it could have be there
S0511	yeah
S0513	but it would have be the same
S0514	no it
S0511	well no because then it would have
S0514	not if
S0511	then it would have
S0514	but you're already assume

S0513	mm
S0512	there you go and they take a
S0512	turn
S0513	it really be
S0512	attack and defend the aim of the game be to get all the players on your half

S0511	so that's me
S0512	yeah and
S0513	oh sorry
