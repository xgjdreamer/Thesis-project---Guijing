S0268	mm
S0308	so we do and then she say there's just one condition say you can have the whole of the west wing but the boys want to convert this into holiday let so while you're live here
S0309	mm
S0308	and how long will that be and i say between twelve months and two years probably
S0309	mm
S0308	that's fine while you're live here can you draw up plan and submit them for plan and build regs to convert the whole house forty seven room into holiday let so i say yeah okay so i do
S0268	forty seven room
S0308	mm
S0268	bloody hell it's like a palace
S0308	so they've get like they've get you know
S0309	mm
S0308	yeah do you know i go up into the attic there and it hadn't change from the day that the army be barrack there
S0308	and the name
S0266	really
S0308	of the officer be still on the doors in the attack
S0266	really
S0309	good lord
S0308	they pour er well over the floor the oak floorboards they'd put straw down about an inch thick and then they pour concrete over the top of the straw
S0309	mm
S0308	why have a guess this be in the attic why would they do that
S0309	insulation
S0308	mm
S0266	sound proof
S0308	from sound proof it be sound proof because of course the the officers' boot you know
S0309	yeah
S0308	would make a lot of noise and they would wear the wood away
S0309	oh yeah
S0308	but they never actually take the concrete up again when they leave so
S0309	bloody hell that must have be heavy
S0308	yeah
S0309	mm
S0308	so you've get
S0266	so have it be remove now
S0309	concrete
S0308	in part well yeah because it start to break up
S0309	mm
S0308	and they've also convert it into holiday home
S0309	mm crickey
S0308	but the kid our kid use to have party up there and of course it be like so spooky
S0308	cos everyone think it be a strange thing when i be draw the plan up there be a discrepancy in the height of the room
S0309	mm
S0308	cos i measure the outside of the build
S0309	mm
S0308	and then measure the room inside and there be like five feet one and a half metres
S0309	blimey
S0308	go astray somewhere
S0308	the build outside be one and a half metres higher than the room inside and we couldn't work this out and then one day there be a fire actually be play golf at and he saw smoke rise from his house
S0266	really
S0309	no mobile phone then
S0308	and we i tail it back and sure enough there be a fire but the fire be come up in our flat the the smoke be come up in our flat we think it's come under the floorboards so i rip a couple of floorboards up and there be this big void
S0309	mm
S0308	one and a half metres deep
S0309	you find it
S0308	yeah
S0309	mm
S0308	and that be the discrepancy
S0266	and why
S0268	why
S0308	well in those days because the ceilings be so heavily mould with plasterwork and whatever it be a suspend ceiling you couldn't have walk on the same joists that be hold the ceiling up because it would vibrate and the plaster would
S0309	crikey
S0308	crack off so they have separate joists for the floor upstairs than the joists hold the plasterwork ceiling
S0268	mm
S0309	god
S0308	it be a
S0266	so you would only get that in big fancy house you wouldn't get that in more simple
S0308	i'm not sure
S0266	build
S0309	be it still
S0308	no no
S0309	it's still like that now
S0308	oh yeah yeah nothing's change
S0309	mm
S0266	so you could hide all sort of things there
S0308	you could you couldn't actually walk cos it be only one point five you couldn't walk along it but you could certainly sort of stoop and crawl along and whatever mm
S0309	crikey
S0308	very interest
S0268	mm
S0309	where do you meet
S0308	at college
S0309	oh
S0308	we be erm we be at college learn teach to become teachers
S0266	where be you do that

S0308	no it's both wasn't it er be both but the dig you know you could have men so
S0268	be it at one time all women cos
