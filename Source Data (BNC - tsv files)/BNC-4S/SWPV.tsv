S0368	mm mm
S0251	it's difficult to get the space just right you know
S0368	you need a lot don't you

S0369	and it have a top on and
S0252	yes
S0369	and whatever thank you very nice that mm
S0252	and it's really nice when it come into season the asparagus quite nice
S0368	mm mm i've never buy it
S0252	that's that's
S0368	never
S0252	it's not one of the cheaper vegetables shall we say it's
S0368	no i know it isn't no i know it isn't
S0252	er
S0369	have you grow it
S0252	it's very hard to grow i haven't grow it now it take two or three years before you can actually pick it
S0369	mm
S0368	oh right
S0252	but there be a erm a big asparagus farm in
S0369	right
S0252	yes
S0369	that's it
S0368	mm
S0252	it's suppose to be a very good vegetable in term of nutrients
S0368	be it
S0252	yes
S0368	mm mm
S0369	mm
S0252	i think it's nice to get the seasonal vegetables i think when something's in season there's there's a world of difference between
S0368	absolutely
S0252	a fruit from somewhere in the world that be sort of not really it's proper place i mean a classic example be strawberries
S0368	they're neither sweet nor soft
S0252	no
S0368	they're just not our type be they
S0369	you see when we be younger we have season didn't we mm
S0368	well
S0369	and we be bring up on season but you know i mean just for example to have a salad like lettuce at christmas
S0252	yes
S0368	mm
S0369	wow that be something
S0368	well no you could you couldn't get it could you
S0369	no
S0368	it be like erm tomatoes you didn't really see english tomatoes until about april
S0369	mm
S0368	and then they just use to come out didn't they
S0369	mm
S0368	you use to buy about two at a time
S0368	didn't you
S0369	mm
S0252	but what be amaze be we have buy english apples from about sort of april well i suppose it would be more sort of august to right till about february but that's how long well obviously the season be not that long so some of them must have be storage but
S0368	mm mm no
S0252	it just show you can nearly do the year
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0252	just
S0368	which i find mind you i know you eat a lot of fruit and we we don't eat so much but i find i can go to morrison's and you know they're nice and firm the apples and when they've be in the dish about two or three days they start to erm
S0252	yeah deteriorate
S0368	mm
S0369	that's because they've be store
S0368	and i think it's the way they're store
S0369	in like some i won't say deep freeze but it's some
S0252	mm
S0369	very control
S0368	chill
S0369	and actually their age er you'd be probably surprise how long they've be pick in other word
S0368	mm
S0369	be what i'm get at and they've be sort of er er keep in erm
S0252	i think sometimes
S0369	animate condition like that
S0252	they get the the temperature just a bite too low i remember there be a a we have an apple and i think it have actually be nearly freeze
S0368	mm mm
S0252	and when we cut it it wasn't very good
S0369	no
S0368	no
S0369	inside they're soft it's as though the the sort of er once upon and time the fruit would start to get go bad from the outside outside in now particularly on a pear i'm talk about it look and feel alright you take a bite but the inside's go
S0252	mm
S0369	mm i don't know whether that's just peculiar to to er pears but er
S0368	mm nice
S0369	well i suppose in a way that's about the the er the fruit i eat
S0368	you like pears better than
S0369	mm than others

S0369	i'll have er an orange er
S0368	excuse me

S0369	oh i do mm
S0368	and i bet it have more power
S0252	mm yes i mean that's only a small little wheel that be intend to as a flour mill so it it's not
S0368	yes yes
S0369	i i say how long ago be that
S0252	that be a long time ago it's in the seventeen fifty five
S0369	mm seventeen fifty five eh
S0368	yeah
S0369	that's some go ain't it
S0251	mm
S0369	you know a watermill
S0251	yeah
S0369	and the thing be you can control it you see
S0252	mm
S0369	cos you can what they usually have on these rivers
S0252	yes
S0369	well further up they sort of widen it and have like a reservoir
S0252	yes
S0369	and from the reservoir the river come
S0368	oh thank you
S0252	mm
S0369	off the river come another little river to the mill
S0252	yes they have a little diversion
S0369	that's it a diversion and they have er a a gate on it like a lock gate on it so if they don't want it they just shut the gate and the river continue
S0252	mm
S0369	but if they want to be er turn the mill
S0251	grind the flour
S0369	er jive that a bite and open that up and there we be now then the only thing about it against it be in winter time it can freeze
S0251	mm yes
S0369	and that and that can happen but
S0252	i don't think the derwent would freeze
S0369	not necessarily but
S0251	the derwent won't but the baby river might freeze
S0369	yes yeah
S0369	and er er in derbyshire where get to get this right arkwright i think it be do the his spin jenny business
S0251	mm
S0369	he use water power but it didn't freeze up
S0252	mm
S0369	because it be a warm water
S0252	mm
S0369	er and there be these warm water spring
S0251	mm
S0252	yes
S0369	mm
S0252	mm
S0251	if it be the flour though you the harvest would be in say september so you'd be do all your grind in late september october by the time it's freeze
S0252	yeah
S0369	mm mm mm
S0251	november december you should have it all do hopefully
S0369	mm but it also give the electricity for the house do it
S0251	erm i think that be later on
S0369	be they that be later on yes mm
S0252	yes
S0369	mm i be gonna say the the bulbs wouldn't be out actually the first er house which have er electric light and that be er up in scotland way i think
S0252	mm mm
S0251	mm
S0369	but but we certainly don't make enough use of er er
S0252	no
S0369	water i mean when we've go to to the dales two or three time particularly with be on the coach and that we go across er this bridge and it's fall
S0252	mm hm
S0369	have you see fall this side of er we're really not too far away but er when that's come over there
S0252	yes
S0369	you can see it's the power in it you can really you know
S0251	you can hear it anyway
S0369	hear it thunder away there mm
S0368	yes
S0369	mm it's marvellous cos you see it's all run off the er moor and that
S0252	mm
S0369	and then er if it's a dry summer or something like that
S0252	yes
S0369	it peters down a bite a lovely picnic spot
S0252	mm mm but i think there'd be lot of disused and derelict water mill about so that would be a start wouldn't it
S0251	oh yeah
S0369	well we go to er didn't we
S0368	mm
S0369	because i hear on the wireless the er about it be about windmills and and watermills it be like a a week of them and they be on exhibition and all like this

S0369	and it be say where they be er and that and one of these water wheel be at
S0251	yeah

S0368	mm
S0369	and it must be in a way the start or certainly a good tributary of the river
S0252	mm
S0369	it go round there fresh water in that and you have to be careful cos you could tell the grind be get a little bite unsure
S0251	squidgy mm
S0369	and you look up there and there be this biggest like half a field and the water's bubble up out of there it's a it's a spring
S0251	mm oh right mm
S0369	mm and i've never actually sort of see a spring
S0251	like that no
S0369	it's like that and it's er yeah it's quite an experience and a and a sight mm you know you really should see it sometime really
S0252	mm
S0369	i mean i've be to spring but i've never see actually a spring
S0251	mm bubble out
S0369	not bubble out the the grind just like that
S0252	mm
S0369	so that river we saw at
S0251	mm
S0369	and it be you know it be a good one clean
S0252	mm
S0369	i i bet you could have almost eat the er
S0251	watercress
S0369	watercress out of there
S0251	mm
S0369	but er what i've read about watercress it say don't
S0251	mm
S0369	don't you only buy like er cultivate watercress because of the chemicals and that further up stream and all like that
S0251	mm you don't know who's be put in
S0369	no
S0368	they would have eat it in the past though wouldn't they
S0369	mm
S0368	they would have eat it in the past
S0251	yes they would
S0369	oh yes
S0251	but there might not have the factories put the chemicals in
S0368	oh no that's true yeah
S0369	wouldn't have be bang all them fertilisers on them
S0368	yeah it would've be fresh wouldn't it yeah
S0252	true
S0368	there's a lot of rapeseed on the way here
S0369	mm
S0368	field and field of it
S0251	i know horrible isn't it
S0368	mm
S0369	it must be one of the easiest of crop
S0368	mm
S0369	and the most er
S0252	lucrative
S0368	yes lucrative yes
S0369	valuable you know for money wise
S0368	yeah that's what we say
S0369	a cash crop
S0251	yeah
S0369	er too and i think they must get two crop a year there always seem to be field there
S0251	yes i've notice it
S0252	it's not suppose to be very good for the be it's like
S0368	oh be it not
S0252	human's have a a big mac it's
S0368	oh
S0251	junk food for be
S0252	it's sort of very fatty and junk food for them
S0368	oh right yeah
S0251	it do spoil the honey though because it make it all erm runny too liquid
S0252	yes
S0368	oh do it
S0251	mm i think so
S0368	oh right
S0251	when i get rapeseed honey it's really watery
S0368	oh yeah
S0251	and pale
S0368	yes yeah
S0369	so be that alter the ecology of of like the be
S0368	so which be the best the clover
S0251	erm yeah there's heather honey isn't there
S0369	be it alter the the be
S0368	yeah yeah
S0252	well it's
S0251	spring and
S0368	mm
S0252	i think it's it's not sort of change themselves but if they erm pollinate that it's sort of fatty whereas sort of lavender and clover and that sort of thing be a healthier thing for
S0369	mm mm
S0368	be that manuka honey
S0251	manuka
S0368	be that any different do that taste different
