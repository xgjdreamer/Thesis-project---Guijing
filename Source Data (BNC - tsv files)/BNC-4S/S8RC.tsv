S0230	i didn't know if you want that little wicker basket to sit on top of the wicker
S0198	thing to put bits on yeah that would be really good
S0192	i think another place below the bay windows might look quite nice with the thing although if the bed's gonna go there
S0198	with the basket
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah the thing be once we get a bed frame our bed won't fit where it be at the moment
S0230	oh
S0198	so we'll have to change everything around then anyway
S0192	have to rearrange
S0230	yeah theirs theirs erm wasn't there it be
S0198	no no it's big enough to fit the mattress perfectly but
S0229	but long ways
S0230	yeah
S0198	it won't fit the frame yeah have to go long ways
S0229	yeah you get your cable for the curtain
S0198	no no this'll never go high enough
S0192	well i put that well it's be work fine with that thing up there
S0198	yeah double up the curtain because erm it be too bright with the street light on
S0229	yeah
S0230	oh
S0198	and that help it doesn't look
S0192	no it look a bite weird
S0198	but
S0192	so we've get the main curtain on and i've bunch it together and then i attach another curtain with four hook this side and four hook that side so it's kind of double curtain and
S0229	yeah you've gotta put it out
S0192	it work but it's just look a bite
S0192	but shoddy but we're students so
S0198	yeah so it doesn't matter
S0192	no
S0230	well i mean
S0198	be be the rule a tea bag per person for the teapot for a teapot
S0230	one bag per person
S0198	yeah
S0230	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0230	erm i mean the big ones that be here before weren't students and look how their curtain be
S0192	well yeah
S0198	it be all hang off weren't they
S0192	it look terrible yeah it do
S0229	and yeah it it be
S0198	but they be the same curtain as the previous
S0230	oh be they
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah they be in the photos
S0192	they just didn't look after them i guess
S0230	oh

S0192	i mean be diverticulitis something to be worry about my dad really hasn't go into it in any detail

S0192	but 's okay
S0230	have these really bad flare up sometimes and and she end up in hospital
S0192	oh my gosh
S0198	mm they can be really serious
S0230	she's always on antibiotics to try and control it
S0192	i think my dad keep these things kind of quiet so i don't really know
S0230	mm
S0198	yeah no i'm sure it's she doesn't do herself any favour
S0230	i mean
S0198	she's be a heavy smoker for her whole life and things like that which do your dad doesn't do
S0192	dad's on antidepressants at the minute that's not good
S0229	well
S0198	yeah yeah yeah my so you know i'll show you or you can figure that one out it's quite clear there's two of these the one that's all gold be the front door and this door will stay open anyway
S0230	i think 's on them as well
S0192	mm
S0230	most of them the amount of my friends that be on antidepressants

S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah yeah have they not have to do that then though
S0230	not yet no
S0198	because they do
S0192	so it can be quite serious then no
S0230	mm
S0198	yeah if you're mean to take better care of yourself
S0192	my dad kind of keep that kind of stuff quiet
S0198	i think there's lot of level of it do you have any in the home mum that be bite more i dunno mild

S0230	and you shouldn't eat too much
S0192	cheer
S0230	but yeah you can eat some bread
S0192	i guess be erm quite a bite sicker so
S0198	yeah probably isn't

S0192	mm to say that my mum's three best friends one be already dead from it and one be die from it and the other one's have it but it's under remission
S0198	it's a real i feel like it's really increase amongst
S0192	her mum die of it
S0198	it have in younger women
S0230	it have it have increase a lot but a lot of that be due to alcohol
S0198	oh it's due to our lifestyle change yeah yeah

S0198	we've get oh no we clear the big one away cos we keep have our windows open cos the weather's be quite pleasant
S0230	ish
S0198	more or less yeah like in this whole side the sun stay on the side this side of the build the entire day it doesn't go anywhere i don't really understand
S0192	yeah
S0198	it just move around but because we have them our windows open a lot we keep get load of spiders come in
S0230	oh do you
S0198	and
S0192	mm
S0198	do a bite of a swoop yesterday cos we get
S0192	probably about four or five
S0198	there be there be a bite of a bigger one that keep come down here
S0230	oh
S0198	while we be study but you can see
S0192	there's a there's a couple up above the
S0198	there be quite a big one in the kitchen last night and don't we don't mind them and we're like let them be but we think well see as be come around

S0198	no but i don't know if it's like see as messy have spiders in your house or dirty or anything
S0198	i don't know
S0192	probably
S0198	so i get to sweep some away
S0230	how be
S0198	good yeah we have a really nice day her and come in for a little while and we have some a cup of tea and then a glass of wine
S0192	she's get a bite hadn't she
S0198	and we chat for yeah she's put on a bite of weight
S0230	oh have she
S0198	but 's never be too small but she's

S0198	petite no her frame
S0192	i think she be quite fit thin the first time i meet her
S0198	but she be she's put on yeah since i mean you haven't see her for a good few years and she's definitely she's fill out quite a bite more
S0192	biggest i've see her
S0198	she's on the implant this year actually she say she's go to get it remove though cos she's not get along with it and that might have boost her weight quite a bite
S0230	have you do anything about yours yet
S0198	no i be gonna up
S0192	keep nag
S0198	i mean it's not do me any harm i've look into that that far i mean some some people claim that it last four years and not three years which i think probably it might do
S0230	it do
S0198	but i mean we're not take that risk but as it just sit in my arm i don't think it's actually do anything i think the reason doctor get annoy be because people leave it in and then they don't use any other form of contraception and then it fail they get worry and that
S0230	it probably get weaker
S0198	yeah as it go along
S0230	on the fourth
S0198	fourth year
S0230	yeah
S0198	and some of them run out i realise in korea after two and a half years but that's if your doctor tell you this in advance and if you're obese so i guess if you're extra fat
S0192	a beast
S0198	a beast yeah a beast
S0192	if you're a beast
S0198	not a beast but obese
S0230	obese
S0198	erm i guess it flush it out it use it up quicker or something so we've be extra cautious but yeah i'm i haven't i haven't for we're register for the online doctor though

S0230	mm just just to keep you top up
S0198	so we don't have to be cos if we go down the route of get a job which we will have to do if this doesn't work out then that be it's gonna really affect our study just schedule and stuff like that
S0192	it's a lot of time apply for job go to interview
S0230	oh yeah
S0229	yeah
S0198	cos it's hard to get just the right amount of hours they'll probably make you do more or less than
S0230	mm

S0198	how do your erm how do your electricity work do they read your meter every month or do they estimate it
S0229	they estimate it don't they
S0230	yeah it's estimate and they read it once a year but i do it all online now
S0198	yeah
S0230	so i send them a meter read
S0198	and you send them your read
S0230	so they're estimate ones they've get
S0229	and our water would be all we can't say what that
S0198	yeah yeah yeah so that i know yeah
S0229	so yeah that's
S0192	how much do you pay on water obviously for
S0230	well we
S0198	yeah don't
S0198	i'll tell you later
S0198	doesn't matter
S0192	yeah okay
S0198	but what's typical nowadays what's average
S0230	what for well it do seem to vary
S0198	from household to household
S0230	yeah yeah
S0198	well my water out of everything be go to be the shocker i mean we don't use a lot of water
S0192	well yeah we've be tell our they estimate our electricity as sixty pound a month
S0229	with the water or what
S0198	but that's just a general estimate for this type of property
S0230	be you be you water meter here be you in a water meter
S0192	be that where you like
S0198	i don't know
S0192	put a card in and
S0230	no no the water be meter as you use the
S0229	out there
S0192	i mean i guess we might be er there be so many meter out there
S0198	i'll have to show you a couple of them on the way downstairs
S0192	that i just don't know
S0198	yeah
S0192	there's like twelve different
S0230	it's like it's in the grind the water meter
S0198	oh be it
S0192	oh so twelve different meter
S0198	because how would they know we're in four different flats five flats
S0229	so you must have a meter each
S0192	yeah there be a lot
S0198	so how do they know which be ours
S0192	there be lot of meter down there
S0230	well that's that's if it's meter it might not be meter
S0229	yeah it might not be meter
S0198	but if it's not meter then
S0192	thing be we've contact the electricity that's fine we've get the internet the water company
S0198	the water company we be on we use our credit on hold to them
S0192	i be on hold for like half an hour credit run out have to stop
S0198	no nothing and because they have those record message it it on skype that log you in and start charge you
S0230	oh
S0198	because someone's pick up the phone
S0192	so even though you're on hold it's cost
S0198	it be like half the
S0192	it cost us about two pound fifty and and
S0198	we literally wait i think about twenty five minutes and nobody answer so we be like
S0192	so i've contact them via the internet i like sign up but they they be mean to send me out something but i haven't receive them yet
S0198	i'm sure when they want our money they'll contact us
S0229	don't the agency know where your water thing be then
S0192	no they don't seem to do anything really
S0198	no they're not very useful for things like that we phone up
S0192	they give us a telephone number they say here's a telephone number ring it up and you can find out who your electricity be and you can find out who your water be
S0230	mm
S0192	but
S0198	and they do actually the er company that come and do the inventory for this flat and then we have that external company come and measure up everything
S0230	mm
S0198	they have take picture of our meter
S0192	but only the electricity
S0198	and log it but only the electricity not the water
S0192	they didn't take a picture of any any other meter
S0198	well what confuse us be there be four picture for our electricity and we be like why we don't have four meter do we but we have some complex
S0192	we have four tariff
