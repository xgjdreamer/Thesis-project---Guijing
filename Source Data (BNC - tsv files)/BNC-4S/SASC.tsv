S0514	i think so
S0513	chancellor but george osborne be the chancellor
S0511	i wouldn't be surprise if there wasn't yeah but that's it be different yeah
S0514	it doesn't work the same
S0511	i wouldn't be surprise if there be a prime minister it's a bite like er the prime minister of of france i saw earlier this week and i have no idea and i can't even tell you what his name be now he's not the bloke you see all the time you normally see the president yeah
S0513	yeah he's the president

S0512	have a erm thingy on it juice thing on the rocket
S0511	no no no no there's no nothing on that no
S0512	oh
S0511	so that's point one for me and the next interview's in on wednesday
S0512	mm
S0511	so then i even after that i'd have to decide whether or not i haven't mention that i want to work part time or anything
S0511	and remotely
S0513	where be it
S0512	as the head of an international organisation
S0511	oh no no it's not they've get a head a director general it's just like a head of a particular programme
S0512	no no yeah a head of
S0511	but that's the point right they're international so everyone's from put the match down everyone's remote all the time right because it's er work in many many many countries so that's why i think it'll be fine if i get it it will involve a bite of travel as well obviously
S0513	to where
S0511	well all over the place really
S0514	all over
S0513	mm that's a bite of
S0511	but i want to when you guy be all bigger i do want to do put the match down international work and so if i can move into it now it'd it kinda feel like a good a good sort of erm
S0514	mm
S0511	segue
S0514	yeah
S0513	segue
S0514	yes
S0513	that's not an expression be it
S0514	yes it be
S0511	no it's not an expression it's a word
S0513	i'm pretty sure that's not an expression
S0514	yes it be
S0511	no it's a word segue it mean to link something to something else
S0513	isn't it a thing with wheel on it that fat people wear
S0511	yeah that's
S0513	yeah pretend to walk
S0511	no they use actually they use those segue in train station don't they to save the legs of the
S0513	yeah but they're also use by fat people
S0511	be they
S0513	to pretend they're walk like go through
S0511	i've never see
S0513	go through the forest and pretend it's like actually exercise but it's not
S0511	i think they be they use it go through the forest for fun like as a kind of fun thing
S0512	yeah
S0513	yeah but it's not like actually
S0511	but they're spell way w a y whereas segue the actual word be g u e but i guess it's come from the same you know it's a pun maybe
S0512	swagways be awesome
S0511	sorry
S0512	swagways
S0513	yeah but they've become like illegal
S0511	do you just say smagway
S0512	swag
S0513	it's like a segway but you don't have handlebars
S0512	it so be just
S0511	those things they ban the other week
S0512	it's
S0513	yeah they ban them
S0512	they're so cool though
S0513	i think they're still allow inside but
S0511	i think they've get better things to worry about than ban those things really
S0511	right so that be point one so i just think i'd tell you that it's kinda surprise
S0514	yeah
S0511	frankly er so right yeah so we need to make a decision er about granny's kind offer for us to go to russia
S0514	yes
S0511	i must 's not that keen
S0514	mm
S0511	so in a once in a lifetime opportunity i give him the book call the atlas of dream place and say where do you want to go
S0511	and he say nowhere
S0511	which sort of make me lose interest at try to find alternatives
S0511	i'm try to establish if 's problem be actually russia or
S0512	or no he he he'll be fine when he get there
S0511	he'll be fine
S0513	don't want to go to russia
S0514	why don't you want to go to russia
S0513	cos it's a crap country
S0511	so i've suggest one alternative that come to mind be egypt
S0511	why be you frown at me like that
S0512	you you know what's go on like
S0511	yeah say that as well
S0512	you know how when we be talk about russia you say it's like egypt just not as bad
S0511	so
S0512	you remember when you say that
S0511	do i say that
S0512	yes yes you do
S0511	no the problem with egypt at the moment it's in sharm el sheikh which be like nowhere near the rest of well it's obviously no it's near some of egypt
S0514	also you know the rest of egypt
S0512	yeah
S0511	erm okay
S0511	so you don't think a cruise up the nile go to see the sphynx and then the pyramid and then
S0513	no
S0514	it'd be pretty cool
S0513	yeah it would but not right now
S0512	it would but
S0514	but
S0511	okay
S0513	it would be alright but just not at the moment
S0511	make a vague suggestion about greece
S0512	aren't they have huge financial problems at the moment
S0511	well that's why you should go there it's good for them
S0513	and everything'll be really cheap
S0511	or we could do a tour of
S0511	i think italy and and rome and things like that
S0513	what like pompeii
S0514	mm
S0513	i've always want to go to pompeii
S0511	pompeii
S0513	go there
S0511	okay so pompeii would make happy 's lose interest
S0514	mm
S0511	mm go on elaborate
S0514	we don't really have anyone who speak italian
S0513	that doesn't really matter
S0514	or have anyone who speak russian

S0512	say that again even er like
S0511	what's his name
S0513	but that's just like you're pretend to be a stereotypical russian or something
S0514	no it isn't that actual be
S0513	russian people actually speak
S0514	we have a russian teacher who be actually from russia that's how she sound
S0511	there's a reason why stereotype be stereotype
S0512	it's not actually a stereotype

S0513	italia pizza
S0511	sorry
S0513	spaghetti
S0511	i say spaghetti just now

S0512	erm russia or egypt
S0511	what
S0514	russia or italy
S0513	italy so that's two to one so erm
S0511	well hang on a minute

S0514	okay so
S0511	so what do we have italy
S0513	italy
S0512	italy or russia
S0511	it doesn't sound quite as adventurous as
S0512	yeah
S0511	the kind of plan russian out i mean
S0514	yeah
S0511	should we revert to plan a and just tell it'll be fine when he get there
S0513	mm i don't
S0511	funnily enough the atlas of dream place the first page have get a picture of er red square in it

S0513	no i won't don't wanna do it
S0514	you always do well most of the time
S0511	and you haven't be able to like kind of really er i mean explain a really a good reason
S0513	just don't want to go be there anything wrong with that
S0514	no but we're curious why
S0513	i just don't want to
S0511	because italy's also full of you know racist homophobes
S0513	pretty sure it's not
S0511	it be fascists
S0514	everywhere be
S0513	yeah but it's illegal
S0511	to what probably isn't there's probably explicit discrimination in er i expect i don't know
S0513	i don't
S0511	i mean it's a country that where the prime minister own all the media i mean it's not a great sign i mean currently he's not prime minister but i mean he's famous for sleep with girls underage girls you know
S0513	do you mean berlusconi
S0511	mm
S0513	he get depose
S0511	mm he have another run for presidency every five minutes though then the place be absolutely corrupt through and through kind of and there's the mafia to contend with don't forget that

S0512	oh i'll help
S0511	no you're not help i think er clearly there'd be some but you'd have to acknowledge if we be to change the plan that we'd all be do it for you and that's quite a consideration

S0514	well consider
S0511	erm yeah everybody else be alter what they want to do on your behalf
S0513	well it's not like any of you be averse to go to italy whereas i be adverse to go to russia

S0511	averse not adverse
S0513	that's not what
S0511	adverse would be something different than averse

S0513	be they
S0511	yeah

S0511	what's go on
S0512	it be mention in assembly
S0513	do they arrest anyone
S0512	no
S0513	damn
S0511	be an ongoing
S0512	mm
S0511	do nobody in year seven know anything
S0514	how much investigation do it take
S0513	mm
S0512	well they've gotta work out who it be
S0513	right mm
S0512	because they didn't have their name on instagram just their instagram name
S0511	god that's not hard be they incompetent
S0512	well exactly that's what you'd think
S0511	they could take
S0513	most people
S0514	a few days
S0513	pretty much everyone have their instagram name list
S0514	well yeah there be that
S0513	under the thing and also people would know it's just that they're not get tell
S0512	yeah like
S0514	yeah
S0511	i guess yeah but i guess they have to find out where where whatever it be originate from
S0514	they have to find out
S0511	where
S0513	it's not difficult
S0514	in a you have to find out in trustworthy way though
S0514	you can't just assume that because someone's instagram name mean that a name that it's actually their name
S0513	yeah like what be the instagram name
S0512	er dunno they didn't tell us
S0511	the detective
S0512	cos i'm not in year seven
S0511	but the other thing be that yeah
S0513	they probably didn't tell year seven either
S0511	they're not gonna arrest anybody right
S0512	except half of year seven already know it anyway
S0513	mm don't know be it
S0511	well they say that i mean there be someone who be put on the sex offender's register recently wasn't there who be like a child for this stuff well let's assume it be what we that you know it be just silly naked picture in year seven good god
S0512	and threaten language we be tell
S0511	oh and threaten then maybe it be bully
S0513	oh it's probably it's probably cyber bully
S0511	well not just cyber bully if the police be involve
S0513	it's just cyber bully probably
S0511	sorry
S0513	it's just cyber bully
S0511	what do you mean by just cyber bully
S0513	i don't understand what the deal with cyber bully be cos you can just block people
S0511	and what do you two think
S0512	it that yeah i'm
S0511	speak as
S0513	call me name i don't care cos they're not true
S0512	yeah and all the same people
S0513	you hear lot of people
S0514	the thing be people do care
S0512	because it's not physical a video you can just
S0511	mm
S0512	block them
S0514	doesn't mean we can just let them be offend
S0513	or you can not listen to them it's not hard
S0512	yeah in actual real life they can physically hurt you
S0511	yeah but you people can do a lot of psychological damage by say things
S0513	yeah but you block them
S0511	but it's interest right because i'm with in that this stuff have to have to be stop it's bully and therefore it stop
S0512	yeah
S0511	it do untold damage
S0514	although to be fair i'm also with in that
S0511	freedom of speech
S0514	it really doesn't matter
S0511	yeah
S0513	it's people be woo or be incompetent with technology
S0511	well no i don't think you should i mean you think about the kind of people who be probably get cyber bully sweetheart it's probably really really unpleasant what be you do you bloody idiot
S0511	i don't think you should be quite so dismissive of that i i really i'm i'm surprise that you be actually i assume they have lot of assemblies tell you how terribly bad it all be and explain the implications of it
S0514	that's probably why
S0512	oh yeah and since then they start put up a display outside the drama hall
S0511	mm
S0514	assemblies be always really bad oh god have they
S0512	yeah
S0511	er display what
S0514	oh no
S0512	it's e
S0511	what's wrong with put up a display
S0512	it's call e safer
S0511	e saver
S0512	e safer
S0511	okay
S0513	be that suppose to be a pun of some sort
S0512	i dunno
S0511	just put e in front of things
S0514	oh god
S0511	what why be you go oh god at just because of a display
S0514	cos it's gonna be horrendous
S0514	it's not gonna work these things don't make any difference
S0511	so what would make a difference
S0513	teach people how to block people i dunno teach people not to be woo
S0511	i don't think you should say these people be woo sweetheart say if somebody be like call you name in real life that'd be really really unpleasant
S0513	not really because they're not true
S0512	you're a moron that's true see
S0511	yeah and say people be like gather round you lot and lot of people and say really horrible things to you in front of everybody else say there be like a group of ten people stand around say you're really horrible whatever whatever in front of load of load of other people and with the other people cheer him on
S0511	yeah
S0513	then what
S0511	well that would be really unpleasant
S0513	but that never happen though
S0511	no but that's what they're say on it's cyber bully
S0511	that's what i'm say be that it's really it's really really public
S0514	more restrictions
S0511	it's it's really silly
S0513	i don't think it be public it's on private message
S0511	well no cos people like if someone's take a photo of somebody say look at this ugly fat person and email it to all their friends or something
S0514	the email can sort of go around
S0512	yeah that count as bully
S0513	email it yeah good one
S0512	that be true
S0511	sorry do that sound really archaic email
S0514	it do
S0511	i saw that somebody er put something on twitter that go completely viral today er

S0511	by surprise well she be work in the library at her university and erm a boy in the library want to ask her out and so rather than he draw on a piece of paper a kind of whatsapp conversation say would you like to go out for coffee and she say no not really and then what so he draw this conversation and then the bottom have like two choices of whether or not she say yeah why not life's very short or no thank i've get an eight foot tall boyfriend or whatever and she and he give this to her in the library cos it's a silent place
S0511	but it he just draw it i mean not sorry it doesn't look like whatsapp but it's kinda get bubble like whatsapp yeah
S0511	and anyway she say no i've get a six foot two boyfriend erm but she didn't say that she didn't didn't draw him a picture but anyway she take a photo and put it on on twitter say something like the sweetest you know thing that i've be ask out whatever like full mark for try or something to this bloke think you know it be just to her friends and it kind of instantly go viral to like forty thousand people
S0514	gosh

S0514	yeah i never really get bully in the first place so i don't really know how bad it be
