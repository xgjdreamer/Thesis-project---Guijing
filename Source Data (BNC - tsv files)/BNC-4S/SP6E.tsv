S0024	but i didn't i didn't use that
S0142	oh that's brilliant that
S0024	be it
S0142	yeah
S0024	i i didn't even look where it be
S0142	especially on long journey all you do be when you get to the speed you wanna cruise at like sixty you just press the button and take your foot off
S0024	yeah but i just want to practise
S0024	you know so
S0142	mm yeah that's a good fuel saver
S0144	be it
S0142	that's that's what the benefit be yeah it's not just for your comfort
S0024	mm
S0142	it it save fuel because it will keep the engine go at
S0144	hmm
S0024	a steady pace
S0144	mm
S0142	yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	hmm but what do you do if you suddenly need to do something
S0024	that's alright you can just
S0142	whatever you touch if you touch the clutch or the brake
S0144	it just switch off
S0024	mm
S0142	it switch it off
S0144	oh okay
S0142	and then you press r resume
S0144	mm
S0142	you get back up to speed you press resume and it take over again
S0144	oh
S0142	and if you find you're do just that little bite too fast you know and you keep creep up to traffic you just minus it a little bite
S0144	yeah
S0142	and it's like or if you wanna increase slightly you just plus it a little bite and it take it up in two mile an hour increments
S0144	mm
S0143	which for somebody like erm
S0144	mm
S0143	it's ideal isn't it cos he he use it a lot doesn't he in that journey
S0142	that journey he's do yeah
S0144	mm
S0143	and you've only get to go up to sixty five seventy and your petrol consumption go whoosh doesn't it
S0142	you fuel count yeah it double yeah
S0144	mm
S0024	mm
S0144	ha it double
S0024	yeah i've hear that before once you go above sixty
S0142	mm mm
S0143	mm mm
S0144	hmm
S0142	oh yeah it's er your right foot control you're your right
S0144	hmm mm
S0143	i'll tell you that next time
S0142	yeah
S0142	i use to teach people how to do that on the road you know when i work down at at 's place
S0144	mm
S0142	at the road and you could just sit there and you could watch what be happen to your fuel
S0144	hmm
S0024	mm
S0142	by maintain the same speed you could half the fuel consumption
S0024	mm
S0144	hmm
S0142	just by get up to speed and then take your foot off the accelerator very very slightly
S0144	hmm
S0142	not enough to slow the car down but you watch the fuel consumption drop cos you're not hold it on all the time
S0144	mm
S0142	yeah it's er it's a clever technique
S0144	mm we'll have to remember that when we're in the middle of the desert
S0142	mm
S0024	well we've gotta practise with a four wheel drive for that
S0144	mm do it say anything about petrol in the budget i didn't see it
S0143	yeah that's go up
