S0199	yeah
S0192	well i guess if you know and your family know isn't it you can trace people
S0193	well be not uncommon be it there be a few s
S0192	it's jewish originally
S0193	be it
S0199	be it
S0192	yeah
S0192	erm i believe and then it be irish it get change a couple of time it wasn't originally it be there's some change of some sort i don't know but i think traditionally it's er i er jewish name
S0193	cos he doesn't know much about his mum do he
S0192	no i be gonna say
S0193	your nan on his side
S0199	well he know his mum he know his mum
S0193	no i well his real mum his biological mum who die

S0192	well i don't think he know much about her family or
S0193	no but i he doesn't know yeah but he doesn't know much about erm we're talk about the history
S0199	oh the family the tree
S0193	yeah his
S0199	yeah yeah
S0193	so his nan
S0199	yeah
S0193	which would be your great nan yeah
S0199	interest mm
S0192	random question 's mother
S0199	
S0193	
S0192	i yeah i remember i remember meet her a couple of time i'm i'm do a module at the minute in pidgins and creoles so like creole english erm i be just wonder what dialect she speak cos i remember when i be younger er think she's great and i didn't fully understand her
S0199	she's hard to understand isn't she
S0192	but she may be speak a form of creole creole english
S0193	i don't know i mean it be
S0192	there's all sort of creoles there's like jamaican creole
S0193	the jamaican version be call patois wasn't it
S0192	yeah it's it's a patois which be a type of language
S0193	mm
S0192	but it be it jamaican she speak
S0193	no she didn't speak patois she hers be just what they call break english
S0192	but break english be a be a negative term
S0193	it be
S0192	for a pidgin or a creole
S0193	yeah
S0192	the type of language be a so a
S0193	so be pidgin or creole the same as erm what your
S0192	yeah it's the same
S0193	as break english
S0192	so a pidgin be a contact language erm develop through trade that nobody speak as a first language they use it as a second language
S0193	yeah
S0192	but when it become a first language it become a creole
S0193	oh i see so it's pidgin then creole
S0192	so when the children start use it as a first language they need to fill in the grammar because it doesn't have enough grammar basically
S0193	no
S0192	to be use in every environment and then it become a creole language
S0193	because it be
S0192	and i'm study creoles at the minute on my linguistics course
S0193	oh be you
S0192	and i be just interest to think what what version do she speak cos there're i mean there be hundreds of creole languages hundreds i'm currently study nigerian pidgin english i have to do a presentation on the phonology of nigerian pidgin so i just be interest to know what her descendants be and what what she speak
S0193	from jamaican and an and an island call st elizabeth off jamaica
S0192	then she speak jamaican creole i would imagine which be creole english
S0193	mm
S0192	it's it's crazy when you listen to it
S0199	it use to worry me when i speak to her because i i know that i be gonna struggle to understand
S0193	oh god i remember when i date er in the early days i use to go i don't understand what your mum say she go rather than just go cos us go yes yes
S0193	and she'd go oh it's you know whatever you and i'd go yes
S0193	er cos they speak very fast the jamaicans and the africans all all the er those be gonna say tribes those kind of those
S0192	do she ever say e or day e be he or she or anything like that
S0193	oh yeah yeah
S0192	and
S0199	yeah
S0193	they slip lot of letter off all the time
S0192	and day e day come
S0193	yeah
S0192	e day come round come here
S0193	yeah that's right
S0192	it's like i'm learn it at the minute there's all sort of strange word that they use so a creole would have to be lexified so basically the language that give it the vocabulary be the lexifier language which be english in
S0193	yeah
S0192	in jamaican creole but the grammar come from the original african languages
S0193	yeah so it's mix
S0192	so the underlie grammar be just a mix of language and
S0193	yeah
S0192	erm it's actually really hard to study because you need to have an understand of the lexifier language be in the colonial language so either english french portuguese or spanish then you need to have some understand of the the substrate language which be the african languages then you also need to have a bite of understand about the local language cos as well depend on where they be move
S0199	oh my goodness
S0192	if there be already local people there they could have influence the language as well
S0193	dialects be amaze aren't they
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	so
S0199	yeah
S0193	when you think of the dialect we have just in one country this country
S0192	yeah
S0199	it amaze me
S0193	well they're they're accent aren't they
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	it's erm well they're dialects accent be just pronunciation dialect be grammar as well so if for example if i say arse and you say ass
S0193	yeah
S0192	that would be an accent but if i say we be and you say we be
S0193	yeah
S0192	that would be a dialect
S0193	dialect
S0192	yeah so
S0193	yeah that's er true
S0192	if the word change and they use different grammar that's a dialect
S0193	i remember his dad he he could never say forty he'd go farety
S0192	farety
S0199	yeah farety far
S0199	it use to crack me up when use to take her off
S0192	i like i like the er irish we we have an old lecturer you
S0193	oh you do be kid me lad you don't know
S0192	yeah
S0193	no hang on how's he go
S0192	well irish
S0193	me jesus me jesus son
S0192	well the funniest thing he'd say you know erm at university the grade we don't get a b c d you get a first a two one a two two and a third well he'd always say you don't want i can't do the accent but
S0193	you don't want to do
S0192	you don't want to get a turd
S0193	turd
S0193	you don't want a turd slap on the desk
S0193	that's right
S0192	you don't want a turd
S0193	so they would that's right they don't go the h the third
S0192	third no
S0193	it's turd
S0192	yeah and er well lot of
S0193	and there's a similarity there
S0192	lot of creoles say ting instead of thing
S0193	oh yeah ting
S0192	lot of word sound like tin
S0193	yeah
S0192	yeah so tin yeah tin
S0193	instead of say
S0192	so yeah i'm study that anyway
S0193	instead of say erm it use to be what's happen you know what's happen today it would be what happen
S0192	mm they don't use the
S0193	but they say it so quickly what man what happen
S0192	yeah
S0193	er well and that's what's happen
S0192	they don't use
S0193	what man what happen
S0192	erm but
S0199	so what do you end up say then
S0192	quite often they'd say be instead of be
S0193	well i never use to go what happen
S0199	no no when you say that you use to just kind of go yeah and smile
S0193	well 's mum wouldn't go what happen because it's a black kind of
S0199	yeah
S0193	cultural thing
S0199	but then you say you use to say just
S0192	yeah that's call stylistic variation they change their theres
S0193	oh use to all the time
S0192	get a bite technical now but like the furthest away from the lexifier language you know i say english be the lexifier
S0193	yeah
S0192	the furthest way be call the basilect and the closest be call the acrolect so the quite often a speaker can use the basilect the mesolect and acrolect
S0193	yeah
S0192	depend on who they're talk to
S0193	that's right
S0192	so if they're talk to each other they will speak the basilect
S0193	oh yeah yeah
S0192	if they're talk to a white person they'll use the acrolect
S0193	yeah
S0192	as close as they can to
S0193	yeah
S0192	to the main language
S0193	yeah that's correct
S0192	so the variation on it
S0193	yeah so it be
S0192	yeah i notice though cos i spend some time in belize and and nicaragua and honduras and they've get like i go to three different areas of of different creoles and i get fascinate by it at the time like when they speak to me i could understand them more or less but when they speak to each other i be like
S0193	yeah
S0192	word be come through but
S0193	a gonna
S0192	i wasn't really
S0199	have you find that your travel have highlight your interest in linguistics
S0192	oh yeah definitely
S0193	it must do
S0199	mm
S0192	definitely
S0193	isn't it
S0192	yeah i be just interest
S0199	mm
S0192	so it's jamaican heritage on that on that side of the family
S0193	yeah st elizabeth in er island off jamaica
S0192	they don't use the copular verb so like be which be a link we would say like i be happy but they might
S0193	oh it's
S0192	it could i mean there's all sort of variations it could just be
S0193	i and i
S0192	pidgins so they could just drop it and say i happy or they could drop they could say i be happy or there's all sort of
S0193	yeah
S0192	variations to it
S0193	they do they drop they drop word
S0192	yeah
S0193	in sentence
S0199	excuse me
S0193	where you off to do a poo
S0199	a poo
S0193	poo poos
S0192	which one
S0193	one two or threes
S0192	three
S0193	one twos or threesy
S0192	what's three time of the month
S0193	no diarrhoea
S0192	lovely
S0192	what's that a mixture of the two
S0193	no
S0192	one plus two equal three
S0193	wee use to be one twos poos and three be diarrhoeas
S0192	lovely
S0193	oh god i know it be funny
S0192	you don't have an ashtray do you i just keep just
S0193	no i just flick it over there and then chuck them in the pot
S0192	cool which pot
S0193	there's a pot over there but just chuck it over there you can see my fag end and then i
S0192	see if i can get it in
S0193	i stop put them in the pot straightaway that's fine
S0192	i'll just leave that yeah
S0193	cos one day it start smoke and it must have be really dry and i think christ so i chuck them down there and then pick them up and it be interest cos yeah i could never understand as you go she couldn't say the hs it would be
S0192	yeah they drop the h they do
S0193	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0193	yeah
S0192	yeah it's interest child can be pickanin or a pickaninny or a pickin they use different word for different things it's actually get kind of racial connotations the word but well we you hear if you read like an old american black american english they
S0193	yeah
S0192	they'd say pickaninny for a child or for children
S0193	and it's like dat isn't it
S0192	yeah dat
S0193	dat instead of that
S0192	instead of that yeah that's the er they don't have the fricative the they don't use that so it become a plosive de
S0193	no
S0192	so if they say dat they will change it all to dat any time thing will become a tink so there's two different type there's a th and a the
S0193	yeah
S0192	and one be voice and one isn't
S0193	th and then th
S0192	isn't voice and th be voice so if it's the
S0193	th be more blow
S0192	the
S0193	it's more vibrate innit
S0192	so if it's get a vibration if it's the
S0193	the
S0192	then it become a de sound cos de also vibrate
S0193	the yeah
S0192	so the become de but if it's a sound with no vibration then it become a te so like think would be tink
S0193	yeah
S0192	rather that dink it wouldn't be dink it would be tink i tink
S0193	yeah do you do that ting man
S0192	yeah do you do that ting man that tink
S0193	yeah
S0192	i tink i do it so i find it quite fascinate and kind of be study it a little bite
S0193	and and she she's not drop she's not drop the accent er she's learn to
S0192	yeah be she still go strong
S0193	yeah yeah
S0192	yeah
S0193	she's about eighty two
S0192	oh wow
S0193	i saw her i saw her the other day she irritate the bloody shit out of me
S0193	she be alright
S0192	why be that
S0193	oh she say whenever you ring and speak to the youngest one who look after her with they still live at home and look after her she go i say i haven't speak to in age she go but and then if it have if i have do it's just be cos i be think about over something probably cos she doesn't see his kid and stuff like that mum and we haven't speak to you about it cos you don't wanna be hear about it you know enough and it would only upset you well you should talk tell me or you talk to me she you know they talk like that they and i say well okay what do you wanna know then she go i don't talk about it now and i'm like okay
S0192	that's another thing about jamaican english interestingly that i learn that erm whereas we put a stress or certain syllables in the word for example shop the stress would be at the begin shop it but they'll put a stress on every single syllable
S0193	yes
S0192	so shop man every every every single syllable
S0193	every every single thing it's almost like they kind of sing it
S0192	syllable yeah it will be stress yeah it would be stress on every single syllable
S0193	yeah we just get shop man
S0192	yeah
S0193	clearly
S0192	so
S0193	every shop i've get to go shop man
S0192	yeah so they stress every single syllable
S0193	can't do it the accent
S0192	no i can't either
S0193	yeah i know
S0199	there be a programme it use to be on television be it paradise
S0193	and the manners be weird the manners what's the what's
S0192	so do speak it
S0193	what oh yeah he use to he use to
S0192	he can speak creole do he
S0193	he use to break into it er sorry when he be with his mat
S0192	yeah jamaican creole
S0193	yeah what man and do the thing with the finger and yes and get over excite and all that and then
S0193	go and do the lingo
S0192	yeah
S0193	lingwo lingo
S0192	do you know they've also get other word in it like erm instead of know they say sabby which kind of sound like savvy you know savvy
S0193	savvy yeah
S0192	but that's actually from portuguese cos originally the portuguese be the first people
S0192	erm what be i say
S0199	savvy savvy
S0192	savvy yeah so they've actually because er the first ever slave traders like the colonisers be the portuguese so there's actually some portuguese word that be use still in their language and because i know spanish which be kind of similar to portuguese so instead of say the word know instead of i know it would be he sabby or something and sabby be from the spanish which mean to know so i can pick up a few word
S0199	it be it would have be interest if you if have get round to chat with her because she be speak some spanish
S0192	oh she be
S0199	when when she come and afterwards say to cos i don't know how it come up something about erm be speak spanish or something and he say well she wasn't speak it right but i didn't want to tell her
S0192	so he know spanish then
S0199	he know more than he actually let on yeah
S0192	yeah
S0193	he understand more than he speak it
S0199	yeah yeah

S0192	and a necrotic spider bite
S0199	yeah hopefully it'll heal up anyway sorry
S0193	pity it's a pity you can't talk you you wouldn't want to trust me talk to but it's a pity you can't have a conversation with him he's so into shit on the computer
S0193	about israelites
S0192	oh be he
S0193	and his and his black history
S0192	why israel
S0193	er because that's where you know jesus come from the israelites

S0192	there's a
S0193	be able to get through to him
S0192	there's the jesus movie have you ever hear of the jesus movie it's like the jesus story but because most of the pidgins and creoles be actually document by religious missionaries that go out they've turn the jesus movie and do the same movie like two hundred time in two hundred different creole languages so you can go and download any version of the jesus movie in any pidgin or creole they've like do the version
S0193	like jesus of nazareth that one

S0193	yeah
S0192	oh
S0193	you'll you'll have to when it's on say get watch
S0199	and to begin with yeah
S0193	watch rastamouse
S0192	some people would argue that there aren't really any languages as such there be just dialects there there's a famous quote that a language be merely a dialect with a navy and an army
S0193	mm
S0192	and that's it
S0193	that sound interest
S0192	that's all it be yeah but er
S0199	what do that mean
S0192	it's call a language because i'm of a different country to you and therefore i'm speak a different language to you for example in in part of pakistan and in india one language be urdu the other language be hindi it's the same language it's exactly the same but one have a different alphabet to the other but it's the same they call it a different language cos they're different countries and therefore they don't speak the same language they speak different languages
S0193	yeah cos it's all
S0199	ah right yes yeah
S0192	so a language
S0199	yeah
S0192	be a dialect with border and
S0193	it's all to do with who's who's in charge who's get the power and who say what
S0199	mm
S0192	but erm what define a language what define if we're speak the same language be what's call mutual intelligibility can i understand you
S0199	mm mm
S0192	if i can understand you then we're speak the same language and you can actually trace on a map of europe you can start you know at england and if you go from here to say frisian in like dutch we can kind of understand them a bite and then if you take them to dutch they'll understand each other and dutch to german they'll understand each other german to austrian you can keep follow that line and you can trace it right across europe where along that line
S0199	because english be the
S0192	they'll understand each other but if they're not right next to each other they won't understand each other
S0193	no
S0192	and you can see how the dialect change
S0193	be english the main language throughout the world
S0192	do you mean the most speak language or
S0193	yeah i mean the most erm speak around the world
S0192	not
S0193	as in
S0192	not in first
S0193	or be it french
S0192	not as a first language erm mandarin be the biggest language chinese
S0193	mandarin
S0192	yeah
S0193	be it
S0192	it's get the most speakers in the world cos they have like nearly two billion people in er you've almost get a third of the world in their country
S0193	oh
S0192	but as as second languages go yes english be the most
S0193	english be
S0192	speak as a second language like for people learn
S0193	and be that because
S0199	to communicate
S0192	another language as a
S0193	and be that just because years and years ago we own or
S0192	we colonise yeah
S0193	yeah
S0192	we and we still continue to colonise today i mean cambridge university go around make exams and you know universities have to take these exams to go and study in other place and you you know english be the language of commerce and business and therefore chinese be learn english and other people be learn it's a form of colonialism isn't it really it hasn't really change pretty much it's just more it's more covert it's not so obvious it's like kind of hide
S0193	no
S0192	and unfortunately to a certain degree i'm part of that because i'm teach english er the way i see it be i think it's a good thing for everything
S0193	well yeah you're you're an englishman you be teakening teaken teach english
S0192	teach english yeah
S0193	to other
S0192	part of me feel bad about that that you know i'm i the money be where the oil be really you know what i mean
S0199	you're instill english into them
S0192	yeah however i don't think it's a bad thing for everyone to share a language i don't think we should lose language i think you should keep your culture and retain your own language
S0193	i don't think there's anything to feel bad about you're an englishman
S0192	but i think
S0193	who's grow up and learn er er and be educate and you're use what you know best with what you can do
S0192	mm
S0199	it won't stop them use their own language
S0193	to to erm
S0192	no
S0193	what you're interest in
S0199	mm
S0193	and to earn money
S0192	but the best job
S0193	why
S0192	be where the oil be mm
S0199	mm
S0192	i feel a bite bad on that front you know what i mean
S0193	so you're go off to saudi
S0192	it's where the better job be and they've hit erm the teach english scene be really burgeon and proliferate in kazakhstan nowadays and this kind of area
S0193	what's profitherlating mean
S0192	proliferate burgeon same thing erm develop lot more be happen
S0193	oh right
S0192	like it's grow around that area
S0193	yeah
S0192	so like erm kazakhstan be really up and come and they're start to pay more because they've hit oil there they're find a lot of oil around that area so effectively the english teachers be follow where they're find oil because you find oil and then the local people get wealthy and then they want more wealth so they wanna be a part of the you know
S0193	so they build house
S0192	the business and then they start
S0193	they build extra things they build
S0192	and they start learn english and do this kind of stuff so it's just part of my job i don't wanna stay as an english teacher forever
S0193	what about dubai
S0192	yeah that's good it's a good job
S0193	that's a good one a lot of people go there don't they
S0192	yeah it's slightly more liberal than saudi as well but it's also harder to get a job there i probably already have to have experience work in the middle east to be able to go there so therefore i need to go to a lesser country first to be able to go but er dubai
S0193	how safe be it
S0192	bahrain abu dhabi be pretty good yeah it's fine i mean you live in saudi you live on a compound
S0193	mm
S0192	and there'll be arm guard around the compound and all that kind of stuff so i mean it's safe enough there's good job in iraq if you consider go there and northern iraq but it's not the safest part of the world so i might not
S0199	mm
S0192	turkey's pretty good turkey pay quite well europe really doesn't pay very well for english teachers at all because they just have so many of them
S0193	so saudi's the best because of the of the fact that they're
S0192	saudi's not the best
S0193	they're the richest
S0192	it's not the best it's er one of the hardest place to live in the world like
S0199	for women
S0192	most most people don't er not just for women for men for everyone so i mean it's especially difficult for women but it's
S0193	so would that would that be a lot of religious culture stuff you'd have to
S0192	sharia law yeah i mean er
S0193	cover up
S0192	would have to wear a full on headdress all the way to the grind she would have to walk behind me in public erm neither of us
S0193	well that's fine you can handle that
S0192	that's cool
S0199	it's whether she can handle it isn't it
S0192	even though we've be together for
S0193	no that that be a joke
S0199	oh
S0192	even though we've be together for nearly ten years if we weren't marry we couldn't be see in public we couldn't touch each other i couldn't go round her house i couldn't be anywhere as it be even if we be marry we won't be able to work at the same institutions i'll be a boys' university she'll be at a girls' university
S0193	oh so why go there just for the money
S0192	i mean
S0193	with all the restrictions on you as a couple
S0192	yeah it pay well like it doesn't actually
S0193	so the money outweigh your lifestyle
S0192	yeah for a year it's fine we i mean i can
S0199	do feel the same
S0192	yeah er we can
S0199	she'll be quite happy to wear the full headgear and
S0192	i mean we we both if we can find the same amount of pay and perk in another country we'll go there
S0193	yeah
S0199	yeah
S0192	rather than saudi but
S0199	that be a big thing for her to have to live like that for a year
S0192	but if we can't but we know that if
S0193	would you have to cover up or do anything different
S0192	erm i would probably have to wear the white head turban it's not a turban it's like a you know it kind of look like they've put a tea towel on their head type of thing
S0199	yeah
S0193	mm
S0192	but i would anyway
S0193	bite of rope round
S0192	because it's hot as ball there
S0199	yeah
S0192	so you'd want to be more comfortable i would have all sort of restrictions i can't walk to a random woman i can't be anywhere near them you know what i mean erm unless they're family you can't be around them you can't spend any time with them whatsoever
S0193	oh for god's sake don't go there
S0192	so it's pretty difficult erm what's most scary to me
S0193	what if you slip up and get your hand cut off
S0192	yeah i mean it happen they they still have in the market every weekend
S0193	i know
S0199	and stone
S0192	they chop people's hand off and stone people erm you can't what scar me a little bite be when you go to the country they take your passport
S0192	you don't have access to your passport you have to apply to leave the country
S0193	don't go there
S0199	you don't agree with any of that
S0192	no but
S0199	how could you put yourself in that situation
S0192	but you know i love to live in interest place
S0199	i know i know
S0192	this be one of the most fascinate part of the world like the way it's medieval it's not
S0199	i know i know
S0192	you know what i mean it's like go back in time you know what i mean
S0199	for the experience isn't it blimey
S0192	and the amount of money that we could save in one year we could travel africa for an entire year on that on one so effectively if we have a bite of a crappy year for a year whereby we exercise eat healthily and i try and do some write and study spanish and then the next year we're no work at all for a whole year it's worth it for us
S0193	really so that pay that well
S0192	the pay isn't that great like in korea
S0193	oh
S0192	i be on about fourteen thousand pound that be all i be on but because they cover my rent and bill be cover in my last job and the cost of living's low
S0193	so that's your money
S0192	i could save about seven hundred pound a month
S0193	yeah
S0192	every every month saudi pay about twenty thousand twenty to twenty five thousand pound a year and again rent's cover and bill be cover so you can save about fifteen hundred pound a month in saudi arabia so
S0199	yeah
S0192	in one year i could save like fifteen thousand pound and that's not gonna happen anywhere else i mean you'd need to be on like forty fifty sixty k in england to save fifteen hundred pound a
S0193	so be you do your master now
S0192	yeah
S0193	which will then give you what opportunity of what lecture
S0192	i can teach at universities in in the middle east so i'll probably still have to teach the english language for another year maybe two years i don't have to i could potentially get a job teach academic write so i could go on and teach composition so then
S0193	mm
S0192	i'm prepare students to go to
S0193	well you like that don't you
S0192	yeah
S0193	you're good at that
S0192	so basically what you're do then be get students up to the level where they can go and study in america or study in england
S0193	yeah
S0192	because they're at a good enough academic level where their write be good enough
S0193	yeah
S0192	and so i'm at teach english that will move to academic write
S0193	yeah
S0192	and then eventually it'll move to teach linguistics and then i'm teach others er probably somewhere in the middle will be teach others how to teach english so there'll be people that want to teach english and i'm teach them how to teach english
S0193	so
S0192	and then the final step will be teach linguistics itself in a european university but to do that i need a phd
S0193	yeah
S0192	so
S0199	that's what 's do at the moment a phd
S0192	that's another bunch of years so you know what i mean i to be able to fund a phd i need to be able to have enough money to live on for four years that's a lot of time you know what i mean and i would need to save at least thirty thousand pound each so that's the plan we go back to the middle east we save fifteen grand each and we travel africa and do another qualification we do a delta that would cover that year we go back and do two more years and save thirty grand each and that will be enough for us for us to do a phd
S0193	well when you when you say go back go back where
S0192	well at that point if we already have experience in saudi then we'd probably try and get i mean kazakhstan as i say be do quite well so we might end up go to kazakhstan or we'd go to dubai or bahrain or somewhere a little more liberal but it's still in the
S0193	's son come back from dubai he be work for the government out there
S0192	yeah
S0193	and he say too dangerous now and he's come back to england
S0192	yeah i mean they're not the safest of place
S0193	mm
S0192	we wouldn't be able to travel that easily there
S0193	the military he say
S0192	but
S0193	the military give him advice to get out when
S0192	it's closer to england i'd only be a five to seven hour flight from england so it would be closer
S0193	mm
S0192	i can travel africa and the middle east which be what we wanna do so it's just a much better reason
S0193	apart from the middle east stuff be there no other countries you prefer to er teach in it alway it seem to be the middle east stuff
S0192	okay well this be the this be the problem with my field where you actually want to go where the life be fun and all like er you're have a good time the pay be really poor for example i'd love to teach in er latin america i'd love to live in argentina or chile or somewhere for a mexico the pay in mexico i'd be on about five hundred dollars a month five hundred dollars i mean it's about three hundred pound a month
S0193	a month yeah
S0192	that's nothing you i mean mexico be not that cheap i'd be on nothing because they have so many volunteer teachers from america
S0193	and what about in this country
S0192	they don't need to pay people very much and erm in argentina
S0193	well what would you be pay in this country
S0192	right now with my qualifications i could be about twenty five grand erm teach esl in a college or something like that i could do that now
S0193	yeah
S0192	but
S0193	and the lifestyle for you be bore
S0192	i couldn't save very much on twenty five grand really
S0199	no because of the cost of live
S0192	the cost of live here i could i could save
S0193	yeah but hang on there'd be be
S0192	but maybe four hundred three hundred a month
S0193	be at the same level as you
S0199	mm
S0192	yeah we have exactly the same qualifications
S0193	so you'd have twenty five grand come in that's fifty grand between you
S0192	yes but twenty percent be tax ten percent be national insurance i whack on another ten percent in my student loan then you've get council tax then you've get you know all sort of tax on top you end up pay fifty percent in tax before you've ever do anything vat twenty percent of every single thing you buy it just it's not cost effective i can earn and save better money elsewhere now once i have my phd i can get a job as a lecturer and i get forty thousand pound a year so that's the only that's the kind of bracket that i need to be on
S0193	so you're over here in brighton for a year to do your master
S0192	yeah
S0193	then once you've both get that then you'll go you want to go to the middle east because the money's out there
S0192	do you want my ten year plan
S0193	no i'm just get the short term one
S0192	the short term so yeah
S0199	's get a ten year plan
S0192	after the
S0193	have you
S0192	pretty much
S0193	okay so after the master it's out to the middle east
S0192	so
S0193	for money
S0192	year do a master year in the middle east year in africa two more years in the middle east
S0193	hold it africa we've get to what's that africa
S0192	travel africa
S0193	travel leisure time
S0192	and also i'll do a well it'll probably be a bite more than a year because i'll need to do another three month teach qualification
S0193	i'd love to go there
S0192	which be delta
S0193	well you you'd probably end up want
S0192	come out and join us
S0193	you'd probably want to stay in africa
S0192	yeah i may well do i mean who know
S0193	yeah it'll be brilliant
S0192	who know erm so this plan may change
S0193	so be you so it's from from the middle east to africa that sound a nice better place
S0192	yeah then but that's not to work i'll do a qualification
S0193	that's leisure
S0192	for three months while i'm there and then i'll travel for a year so i'll be there for probably about a year and a half it's very possible if we're do well enough in our field that i could get involve in some creole research while i'm out you know in nigeria or cameroon or somewhere random like that i don't know
S0193	do you speak french
S0192	no but i'm gonna learn it while i'm live in the middle east so that i can it's it's absolutely necessary
S0193	africa innit mm
S0192	to like to travel there erm so let's say i continue on that plan i go back somewhere that pay well for example of the middle east most job in the middle east that be good be on a two year contract which be why i'm gonna have to take not such a good job because i don't wanna work for two years i've already get itchy feet and i've just
S0193	why why well if you like africa do you think you would stay live out in africa
S0192	there's no money there there's no money i wouldn't get pay there nothing i'd have to most job be volunteer so i can volunteer and do some research and have my board cover but
S0193	so the this the the school or colleges or whatever they have out there will be pittance money
S0192	yeah there's nothing there there's no money erm china's come on there's a lot more investment there like some british universities be team up with chinese universities so in general chinese universities
S0193	oh yeah
S0192	only pay about six hundred pound a month which isn't a lot but if you go and work for one of these combination unis then you'll get about twelve hundred pound a month or thirteen hundred pound a month but there's not many of these yet but a lot of people in my field be say that china's just gonna keep go up
S0193	yeah yeah
S0192	and the pay's gonna keep go up
S0193	yeah
S0192	so it's possible we could go back and work there at some point so master middle east africa
S0193	and then china i reckon
S0192	two more years somewhere that pay well then i should have enough to do a phd and then a phd take four years so i'm already get ten years
S0193	so you definitely want to do your phd
S0192	yeah and we're probably gonna apply to do our phd in america or canada somewhere or australia somewhere
S0193	oh you've get live in america have you
S0192	no somewhere because as well you've get more chance of get fund
S0193	yeah
S0192	if you're a foreign student than if you're not so if i go in as a foreign student in in america or somewhere then i mean potentially i don't need to save all that money but i'm go to anyway because maybe i do need to and i'll apply to do a phd but the problem be you don't know if you get fund until you get accept so you apply to a phd you get accept and then you apply for fund
S0193	so when do you get the professor title
S0192	so i'll have to apply to load of so once i have a phd
S0193	oh
S0192	and i'm teach at a university i'm already a professor in some countries the the what make a professor change in korea anyone that work at a university be a which be different to a be teacher be professor the translation be professor so in english they call me professor but in england you'd never be a professor with the qualifications i have
S0193	no cos the standard be higher
S0192	no in fact in england you're a lecturer when you have a
S0193	so what would you be here in
S0192	i i to be a professor
S0193	you'd be a lecturer here now
S0192	no no no i can't even work at university not even with an ma maybe with an ma if i teach esl if i teach english teach english as a foreign language with enough experience and with a master you can teach at a uni but if i want to teach for example there be two course run close together in my uni one be an elt course english language teach and when i look at all the lecturers there only three out of ten have their doctorate the other seven just have master and lot of experience however on the course i'm do all the have a phd you have to to do linguistics but they're still not professors in england you need to have be a lecturer for years and then you become a senior lecturer and then after that you become a professor however in america as soon as you're teach at a uni you're a professor so it's the what make a professor be different in different countries
S0193	yeah and it's larger america isn't it it's
S0192	so in england i wouldn't be a professor until i'm like fifty i'd have to get a job at a uni and i'm like forty and
S0193	yeah and your hair would be long and you'd have a big forehead and a brain and you'd be like in tweeds
S0192	big grey beard
S0193	yeah
S0192	tweed jacket
S0193	yeah
S0192	yeah then maybe i'll live in england
S0193	when do you realise you like study and find the
S0192	when i go to uni i think
S0193	bug for it
S0192	when i go to uni
S0193	be it just at uni
S0192	yeah i admire all my professors and decide that's what i want to be and that's what i want to do i enjoy teach it's the problem probably and i may never live in england permanently
S0193	mm
S0192	but we love europe and we love european culture
S0193	mm
S0192	and we like be close to family and friends so
S0193	yeah
S0192	if we could get a job you know at a dutch university or if it's in a spanish university then we'd probably go there but still we need a phd to do that so
S0193	so that would be nice to settle if you when you eventually if you have a family to bring up your children
S0192	yeah
S0193	not too far away and in a culture that you'd perhaps be happy with
S0192	yeah
S0193	them grow up in
S0192	somewhere you can have a bite of fun as well as not just know what i mean
S0193	yeah and not have to sort of two miles have have your have your
S0192	even korea's not that easy
S0193	have your daughters walk down the road behind you
S0192	quite a few people go to korea and say it's too hard i can't live here
S0193	plus nanny you'd nanny would want to be involve
S0192	mm
S0193	and er great aunt
S0192	mm
S0192	definitely
S0193	yeah
S0192	so
S0193	so that's be you talk ten years before you settle somewhere permanent and raise a family
S0192	yeah i'd i'd say so erm
S0193	which put you about forty
S0192	i would say and i
S0193	fortyish could be become a dad
S0192	and i may be ready to have children late like forty
S0193	yeah
S0192	but the problem be 's biological clock so we've discuss i don't know if
S0193	oh
S0192	have i not discuss this with you before
S0193	no no
S0192	's mum hit the menopause at forty
S0193	yeah so do i
S0192	and in her family they hit it quite young so erm we've seriously discuss if we're ready to have children at that point we may adopt because if i mean if she can have children at that point
S0193	yeah
S0192	then maybe that will be but i don't see us be ready to have children for ten years not if this be what we do wanna do however this may change i may do my ma now completely fail it not do very well in and and if i don't do well in my ma there's no way i'm gonna get accept onto a phd so
S0193	and what would you do if you fail do you have to redo it it's cost every time isn't it
S0192	i mean i wouldn't i wouldn't fail but if i don't get a really good grade i'm definitely not gonna get fund for a phd so if i get an a my a first a distinction my chance of get fund be massively increase
S0193	mm
S0192	if i get a two one a b a merit then i'm probably gonna have to pay to do it myself to do a phd maybe i can get part fund for something
S0193	mm
S0192	if i get lower than that i get a c a two two then
S0193	what's what's
S0192	i'm not gonna be able to go on and do a phd
S0193	what's the best thing about teach out in korea i mean be it very reward with all the kid you're with with the older children now aren't you
S0192	erm i didn't really like work in public school to tell you honestly i have to do it to get the experience but
S0193	mm
S0192	i definitely enjoy more work at a university what's the best thing about live in korea live abroad in general it's the first well i mean it be my second home and it be the first sort of place
S0193	no i mean your job i mean it must be like fantastic to be in a different country and have the heat and
S0192	well my erm
S0193	a lay back lifestyle and
S0192	what i really like about my job be i have no office hours so
S0199	we need to go in a minute
S0192	do we have to go god
S0199	yeah
S0192	i really like have no office hours so can i have one more cigarette and then go be that alright
S0199	as long as we're there for five
S0192	what's the time now
S0199	twenty five to
S0192	well we should be shouldn't we
S0193	oh he's only round the corner isn't he
S0192	i have
S0199	by the tennis club
S0192	i have no office hours
S0193	yeah that's only ten minutes when
S0192	so when i finish teach i go home which mean sometimes my teach block be lovely i come in and do from nine till twelve and then i'm do for the day and you know i've get plan to do but i can sit in my pant at home on the computer
S0193	yeah
S0192	and do it
S0193	yeah
S0192	so i like that freedom
S0193	yeah
S0192	and the responsibility i have i i have to to completely grade them i have to observe them i have to make up the exams for the class i have to it be nice to have yeah i have to write the exams and then mark the exams and do speak exams as well as write exams so i give i'm give them a grade that go towards
S0193	yeah
S0192	their final mark
S0193	yeah
S0192	you know what i mean in english but i wasn't teach the major in english i be teach all major so i actually have a lot of engineer students so still some of the students didn't really wanna learn english but they have to
S0193	yeah
S0192	part of their degree mean that they have to do it so once i have my ma then i can move into teach english students they're there to study english
S0199	mm
S0192	and then they'll be much better behave and they'll be much better students but actually it be
S0193	so do you find that hard then the the kid that didn't wanna really learn
S0192	it's a challenge yeah i mean my last
S0193	cos it be as a teacher isn't it
S0192	oh yeah
S0193	to get the kid interest
S0192	mm definitely
S0193	be the first bite isn't it
S0192	i think a very important part
S0193	at all
S0192	be to hold no grudge against them whatsoever i have a girl in my last er one of my hardest class i have to teach be a their major be music and and er music and art they have no interest in english whatsoever none and i have this girl in my first class of the semester and i go just to see how she be get on and she do this to me as if to say go away
S0193	yeah
S0192	you know what i mean i'm not interest and
S0193	yeah
S0192	most i tell my colleagues and they'd all all they be like i'd hate that person i just blah blah blah i think if you take how a student react personally you're not gonna be a very good teacher
S0193	you can't no
S0192	and you're not gonna take it well i didn't i make an effort to
S0193	you have to
S0192	to make some kind of connection with her and to get her to understand
S0193	cos you're the teacher and you're there to
S0192	and i tell you what by the end of the class she be friendly with me and she like me
S0193	yeah
S0192	and she she do better than she would have do i think have i neglect her
S0193	yeah
S0192	in the class erm i don't take any of it personally
S0193	because you always gotta think you don't know what these kid
S0192	no
S0193	what's go on outside
S0192	exactly
S0193	or in their personal life
S0192	and i i actually think it's quite important perhaps to have teachers
S0193	and it's a very responsible position be a teacher
S0192	that weren't necessarily good students i wasn't a very good student at school so i can look at those people and say you know what when i be in your position i didn't wanna be here either
S0199	mm
S0192	so i understand where you're come from and i can empathise with that
S0193	yeah
S0192	i think that's an important attribute for a teacher but
S0199	mm
S0193	er er yeah absolutely yeah
S0192	so erm i'm look forward to teach people that definitely do wanna do that but i i really enjoy be at the uni way more than i enjoy be in the public school because they really didn't wanna learn you'd get a few students that would always help you out and they'd always volunteer answer and stuff but
S0193	and it just make your job like so
S0192	but the majority yeah be difficult
S0193	why be i here
S0192	you'd spend you know
S0193	and what's it like where you be now
S0199	most of the time look after the class
S0192	i'm not teach now
S0193	no
S0192	i'm just study
S0193	no yeah what's it like where you be at the uni
S0192	oh the uni i love it really well facilitate the uni's a really high standard i have to do a lot of work i'm put in about seven to eight hours of study a day on top of everything you have to
S0193	what
S0192	i mean my read list per i'm do four modules at the minute and every week they send me homework each module and if you and it's you have a set of homework which for me be language analysis i have to analyse i'd be just analyse german and i be analyse cameroonian pidgin in my last class
S0199	jeez
S0192	if you haven't do that when you come to the seminar well you haven't get anything to contribute
S0193	yeah
S0192	so you can't talk about it but each module of those four set me probably assign ten book a week that you have to read you don't read the whole book but they'll be like here's ten book read chapter one and two of this book
S0193	yeah
S0192	read read chapter four of that book read chapter
S0193	yeah
S0192	so you're read about forty chapters a week which be probably about four book a week
S0193	yeah
S0192	i've get to get through about four book
S0193	yeah feed your brain all the while aren't you
S0192	yeah i've learn a lot already
S0193	with information
S0192	so erm there's a lot of work
S0193	well what be the other students like be they similar age or all age
S0192	it's quite a young crowd actually
S0193	background or
S0192	out of twelve of us on the course there's only three that be british erm two be saudi one's polish one's russian one be er
S0193	you go to russia didn't you
S0192	no no i haven't i've be
S0193	oh you
S0192	through russia
S0193	through russia
S0192	i i change plane in moscow but i haven't
S0193	oh
S0192	i haven't be to russia no i've be very close i go to northern china and it be russian there be a lot of russian people around and a lot of russian culture because it be only about a hundred miles from the border with russia but it it wasn't russia i haven't actually be to russia it's really hard to go to russia
S0193	mm
S0192	they're very very very strict on their visa
S0193	the iron curtain as they use to call it
S0192	visa policy you only get a one month visa to go you can only go there for a month and to get that month you have to tell them exactly where you're go and exactly where you're stay you have to have everything book and plan and you have to have be approve by the government and
S0193	not like here it's just yeah come in come over we'll house you and do your operation
S0192	basically
S0193	i know but then
S0192	so then
S0193	we're in a pretty safe country
S0192	mm
S0193	haven't get too much to worry about
S0192	mm it's get one of the highest crime rat in the world england it's in the top fifty out of three hundred countries in the world for you know crime rat
S0193	mm
S0192	i think it's fairly safe here there's no civil war or anything like that you know what i mean but
S0193	yeah i'm on about war not the crimes
S0192	but the crime rate's quite high
S0193	that's due you know
S0192	but it depend how you judge crime rat cos i mean
S0193	that's the police force innit
S0192	korea have one of the lowest crime rat in the world but the reason be that a lot of the crimes that happen they don't consider crimes they just overlook it
S0193	yeah
S0192	it would be a crime in england but it
S0193	so it wouldn't be report would it
S0192	no cos like for example
S0193	so what i stab my dad he upset me
S0192	no not not not quite to that degree but like
S0192	like traffic their laws they don't seem to have any laws on the road they just go they drive through red light if they want to and all that kind of stuff
S0199	they're mental aren't they
S0192	there there's just no the the problem be there's a hierarchical culture and all the police be really young so if you're old a young policeman can't tell you what to do because he's younger than you so if a young policeman pull an old man older like of of some kind of high status and say you know you be speed he'd laugh at them and just drive off cos they're younger than him they're they're not so they so those crimes aren't report as be crimes
S0193	so the older you get the easier you get off with stuff
S0192	mm you also become a scapegoat though i don't know if you hear about that boat sink
S0193	yeah
S0192	in korea kill like three hundred people
S0193	yeah
S0192	they completely blame it on this the
S0193	be you over there when it happen
S0192	oh yeah yeah it just happen not far off the coast to where i use to live it be probably about thirty miles off the coast it be terrible three hundred children die
S0193	yeah i know
S0192	you know why they die
S0199	do they leave the
S0192	partly cultural it's an obedience thing they listen to their elders this be what i'm talk about this hierarchical thing and the the boat captain tell them to stay still and they do and nobody move
S0193	even to the point where they be sink
S0192	and this they there be them just stay there for an hour
S0199	oh my god
S0192	and then about forty five minutes in the boat tilt and the boat tip so imagine you be in the floor and now you're on the wall and you can't get out so they have all the boat there to rescue them and they could see the children inside but they couldn't get them out
S0199	oh my god
S0192	and the boat just sink yeah it's terrible and that they completely blame the ship captain and he commit suicide and a bunch of other people commit suicide over it they lose face the the head the the vice principal of the school hang himself outside the outside the school like it's terrible
S0199	oh my god
S0192	it be really horrific and we be there it be really bad it's a bite of a cultural problem it's like if somebody above you say do this personally i i think the teachers be mostly to blame not him
S0193	yeah be gonna say what about the people look after the kids' safety
S0192	the the captain didn't know exactly what be go on exactly exactly and what about the
S0193	what be they do go stay there
S0192	what about the children themself they weren't young they be like middle schoolers and
S0193	yeah
S0192	and er so they should have be go hang on a minute i'm on a boat there's a problem isn't the safest place on deck where i can potentially jump off no they some of them get in cupboards i don't know what they think be go on but they climb into cupboards and be like texting their parent say you know there's something wrong we don't know what it be but it's okay i'm safe i'm in a cupboard it's like well
S0199	oh gosh
S0192	it be horrific
S0193	uneducated it's uneducation
S0192	pretty much all of pretty much all of the adults get off
S0199	oh
S0192	and the captain get off as well but the problem be that by the time it the the boat just suddenly tilt and then you couldn't get them off
S0193	so where be the kid below deck
S0199	yeah
S0192	yeah they be all inside and they be all tell to stay inside so they stay inside and then
S0193	well what happen to man woman and women and children first
S0192	well they weren't evacuate at this point they didn't know the boat be sink they the there be a whole load of things they they'd adapt the boat they pile on a load more weight onto the boat the boat should have be decommission ten years before but hadn't be
S0199	jeez
S0192	there be all sort of things that hadn't happen it be just a series of bad events
S0193	mm
S0192	but the adults that be on board
S0193	so there be no safe there be no health and safety in there at all
S0192	once they hear a bang no they all go they all go out onto the deck so that when the boat start to tilt they be ready to jump off
S0199	they could get off yeah
S0192	and they do so all the adults just
S0193	and nobody go to rescue the kid
S0192	they couldn't get them out the boat be can you imagine like there's the exit how do i get to the door
S0193	oh right yeah and they're down yeah
S0192	you know what i mean the door's above me you they couldn't get out it's terrible because there's picture of
S0193	so they drown
S0192	there's picture of the people rescue them on the boat look in look in at the children and they couldn't get them out
S0199	oh jesus christ
S0192	erm these children all drown and it's terrible cos they spend weeks the people wouldn't believe it they keep pull body out and they be send scuba divers and numerous scuba divers die just like try to get them out and stuff
S0193	do they
S0192	it be horrific yeah it be
S0193	jesus
S0192	it be a it be a massive catastrophe the thing be exactly the same thing happen fifteen years ago and exactly the same thing happen fifteen years before that they've have three big boat catastrophes and i mean i've use these boat quite a bite i go to jeju on exactly the same boat that sink it be go to jeju
S0193	so nothing's be learn from it
S0192	i wouldn't have die though i'd have get off the boat and swim and the thing be in korea you're never far from land they be no more than two hundred metres from land
S0199	oh my god they could have swim
S0192	yeah mm some would have die but some would have definitely get off
S0199	we need to go
S0192	it's terrible isn't it
S0193	yeah
S0192	i'm go to go to the toilet would you guy keep talk when i go to the toilet and then i'll

S0192	why
S0199	er well before before she'd split with and all that go on i don't know i think i find her too dominate maybe
S0192	yeah

S0192	yeah
S0199	and i get irritate by things i think i don't know
S0192	do you have any big row or anything

S0192	yeah
S0199	so erm it kind of make us understand each other better
S0192	gotta be honest haven't you you can't
S0199	yeah
S0192	do these things
S0199	but then you you grow you're learn all the time aren't you about yourself as well and about other people and your your level of tolerance and maybe and things like that change and just things that use to wind you up or irritate or whatever don't anymore kind of thing
S0192	it's strange you have to learn about yourself isn't it
S0199	yeah
S0192	you'd think you'd know yourself be yourself but problem be as well you're try to learn about an ever change person we change so
S0199	yeah and i think also other people help you see yourself cos you think you're one way and then you might have a fall out with someone or they might say something to you and you and you think god be that really how people see me
S0192	yeah
S0199	and then you think well actually when you start look inwards that's the only way you ever learn and it's take me a long long time to be able to learn about myself but you start look at yourself in another way
S0192	oh
S0199	and think okay well maybe i cause that or maybe if i hadn't react in that way or you know jump to the wrong conclusion or stress about something or
S0192	yeah i didn't feel good that i be stress when you come down the other day about that pub
S0199	oh don't worry
S0192	i have to tell you honestly i be kind of smoke at that point and try not to let you know
S0199	oh really why
S0192	i be actually erm
S0199	you're you're your own person
S0192	i know
S0199	if you're smoke you're smoke it's not you know
S0192	i be really crave at that point
S0199	oh you daft thing
S0192	and be like i know i know you need to smoke to smoke
S0199	i don't i don't judge you by how you react on a certain time or day you want it to be nice and it wasn't the way you want it to be at that point
S0192	but i think 's point out as well i don't get stress about things i can't change
S0199	yeah she say that to me as well cos i say
S0192	which be the truth because
S0199	yeah
S0192	we travel or like for example i i think we say to each other the other day
S0199	yeah
S0192	you know we do well not to get annoy about move in and there's a massive nursery behind us like really we just kind of
S0199	i'm never gonna get out if i don't push
S0192	we just kind of take it
S0199	yeah
S0192	but and then i kind of say well that's cos we can't change it can we i'm not gonna move house or do something like that
S0199	yeah
S0192	but if there's something that i could have avoid or i could have change then i guess i beat myself up a bite and
S0199	yeah
S0192	get a bite annoy about it
S0199	yeah
S0192	that's when i get stress
S0199	i think i'd like to see you not let those situations get to you
S0192	yeah
S0199	because it's not good for you to feel that
S0192	me too no and
S0199	stress about it
S0192	me too i don't like get hit up and stress
S0199	and i don't want you to feel on edge when
S0192	i mean i wasn't that stress when you be there be you
S0199	no not at all not at all but i know you well enough to know that those things bother you
S0192	yeah
S0199	and you want it to be right and you be concern that we weren't gonna find somewhere and and i think you probably over worry for us when we weren't worry at all
S0192	yeah i be
S0199	so that be something that would like relax you more if you just especially us
S0192	yeah i know
S0199	you know i i wanna i want you to just kind of you know just not be worry about what we think or feel or those kind of things that go round in your head do that make sense

S0192	i think they're just park aren't they small little car like that
S0199	oh i whiz into that space really easy didn't i
S0192	i know pro
S0199	i be quite impress with myself right bypass let's go the bypass
S0192	shall we go on the bypass
S0191	uhu
S0192	it be that didn't like loud noise do he when he be really young
S0199	do he not
S0192	do you not in the car didn't he like i have weird memories of things that i'm not certain if they're real or not
S0199	be it that he didn't
S0192	i swear he didn't like
S0199	didn't like be leave in the car
S0192	no he didn't no he would you be go too fast that be it
S0199	oh that's it yeah
S0192	yeah
S0199	yeah he didn't like the speed
S0192	no
S0199	that be because take him in the cycle carrier
S0192	yeah
S0199	on a bike one day and they go whiz down the hill and from then on he have a thing about go too fast
S0192	he be scar
S0199	yeah he
S0192	he get over that though
S0199	he's not oh god yeah he's not bother now
S0192	cos when i be here i remember he get really upset about go too fast but i mean it be near the airport or something in town
S0199	slow down slow down slow down yeah erm but now we kind of talk about the miles per hour and we're okay cos we're in what they tell us we're able to do and things like that cos
S0192	yeah we're in the zone
S0199	yeah so if they think we be go too fast then the road would tell us we have to slow down so we do all that really
S0192	er i have
S0199	be that tasty
S0192	an interest question
S0191	yeah
S0192	and i wanna know what they say when we're talk together when me and mummy be talk or mummy and other people be talk other adults how much do you understand
S0191	nothing
S0192	do you understand a hundred percent do you understand fifty percent do he understand percentages
S0199	do you understand all of it or half of it or a little bite of it or nothing
S0191	half of it
S0192	half of it
S0199	half of it
S0192	so when we're talk you only understand half
S0191	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0199	do you listen to it all or do you just kind of listen to some of it
S0191	awesome
S0199	i i don't think you listen to it all do you
S0192	i wanna find out what children think what how much they actually understand
S0199	it's amaze how much they take in
S0192	oh yeah definitely i'm learn all about erm cognitive science at the minute learn about language faculty erm and how children acquire language and how there be set of they believe the the model be that there's erm principles and parameters theory for example in english we have what's call head specific language where that mean complement go after the head so for example in the sentence i eat pizza in the bath yeah
S0199	mm
S0192	just as a random sentence i eat so eat the complement to eat would be pizza in the bath the complement to pizza with be in the bath the complement to in would be the bath if you know what i mean the complement to the would be bath there it's head first which mean that the complement come after the word but there be languages that would say i eat bath the in pizza it's the other way round
S0199	really
S0192	yeah they're call head final languages korean be head final language
S0191	awesome
S0192	so they find that there's parameters and they basically
S0191	awesome it's stay there
S0192	that we have the capacity in our brain our brain have a model for language already and all they cos originally behaviourists believe that children learn from positive and negative things that they listen and and they hear stuff
S0199	mm
S0192	but noam chomsky in the sixties turn around and say how be that possible when children can say things that they've never hear before they can use constructions that and how be it that a child can hear us say things incorrectly yet doesn't repeat it they don't there basically they believe that there's a framework underlie the language and all the child have to do be decide be it head first or be it head last be it null subject or do it have a so i be gonna explain null subject in english we say i speak we have to say i
S0191	awesome
S0192	with the speak we can't just say speak i we have to say i speak english not speak english but in spanish they don't they just say which would be i speak english not so english be call a non null subject language and spanish be an er be a null subject language so they believe that children just set the parameters they listen and they go i need to say the the who it be in this language so then they say it and they structure the language that way that's what i'm study not in syntax i'm study the underlie structure of language and how the variation between languages and there's all sort of parameters
S0199	oh my goodness
S0192	for example another one when we make a question erm
S0199	you know what you sorry go on
S0192	for example the sentence what do you eat the original sentence be actually you do eat what but then the inversion process cause the do auxiliary to come first what do you eat not you do eat what what so the what move to the begin the do move but certain languages don't move the what phrase that stay at the end so in english we have a head first w h operator in chinese they don't it stay in the same place so the child just have to learn those switch learn whether we move those w h question to the front or we keep them in place do you know what i mean
S0199	yeah
S0192	so they think that it's call poverty of stimulus be the argument that there's no way that children have hear enough to be able to use as much language as they're use therefore they must already have the language and they just have to put the word of the language in
S0199	goodness
S0192	it's quite a crazy theory that they've be build on since the sixties and it's it's completely revolutionise a lot of field about language er acquisition and how we do all this kind of stuff
S0199	you know what you say about erm not correct them
S0191	oh my god
S0192	yeah
S0199	because they correct themselves
S0192	yeah
S0199	i've be try to not do that but er i can't remember like er what will drop
S0192	don't not correct him
S0199	no will drop like letter out of his word and things and i cannot
S0192	okay
S0199	not correct him because and what i've be see i do it what i've be say to be when he's say the word i'm like now spell that to me how do you spell it
S0192	that's a little bite different i understand what you're say but we're confuse two slightly different things
S0199	like mar in
S0192	yeah we're confuse two different things though when i say that children don't learn from negative reinforcement i'm talk about grammar not about pronunciation
S0199	right
S0192	pronunciation you've get a problem with mar in because the elite standard say that you must pronounce the t martin
S0199	but how do children learn to spell if they don't know how to say it properly
S0192	well spell and and pronunciation be arbitrary anyway how do you learn to spell the word enough even though it end in a g h you just learn it by rote process of do it
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	however what they're argue be that children don't learn like if it's grammar so when he say i broked it even if you say no it's break er i break it
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	that doesn't matter he will learn that anyway
S0199	right okay
S0192	so it's not pronunciation
S0199	so it's not right
S0192	it's grammar
S0199	okay
S0192	it's grammar pronunciation if you want him to speak what you would consider to be properly then yes you do need to reinforce that
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	because you're try to make him a set way
S0199	mm
S0192	but most languages in english follow the same grammar we all say i speak you speak he speak so if he say he speak and you say no it's he speak then he'll ignore you and just whatever he'll get it
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	he'll get it himself regardless
S0199	i have stop do that i've just answer him with the right
S0192	the right
S0199	way of say it
S0192	the right yeah you can do that
S0199	but but i've have be try to like with
S0192	you say it as well
S0199	i know i know i do i mean you know
S0192	that's fine there's no problem with that
S0199	you know but with him like i do with you and with i'm still pick up on end his ts and
S0192	yeah
S0199	ss and you know all of that kind of thing
S0192	that's that's your personal preference
S0199	because i think it will help him with write and spell
S0192	yeah i mean that's fine and that's a good argument for it
S0199	because if he's do his phonetics which be erm you know spell out the letter whether we agree with it or not agree with it that's how he's learn
S0192	but that's
S0199	so when he come to write it if he's see in his head mar in he's never gonna write it properly
S0192	but what if
S0199	and if he say mar tin
S0192	but what if we don't
S0199	and he break the word down
S0192	i agree with what you're say but what about if we don't teach him phonetics what if we don't say a t be always te sound what if t sometimes be a er sound what if you can say mar in what if that's another variant of the t sound he'll still know that you spell it t you write it t but sometimes t can be pronounce differently if it's at the begin of a word truck
S0199	but he won't know it at the moment will he
S0192	or teacher you're always gonna say te you're always gonna say teacher he will he'll he'll recognise that because the rule that you're talk about isn't it's it's in a specific location it happen at the begin of in the middle of the word or at the end of the word we also do it with er we don't say baker with an r we say baker er we just use a schwa
S0199	baker yeah
S0192	so but we know that it's spell e r because we understand that the e r sound can either be pronounce err or er
S0199	but he doesn't at the moment cos he's learn that
S0192	he will because he'll hear it whether or not you would know that he's do it
S0199	ah
S0192	he'll learn that anyway he'll pick up that if i see say a t at the begin of a word teacher it's always te sound but if i say a t in the middle of a word mar in it can either be er or te it depend on who i'm around and and
S0199	or who's say it
S0192	or who's say it
S0199	yeah
S0192	yeah so he will pick up that variation and to a certain degree decide on who he want to copy so if you're do it one way and 's do it the other way he'll learn both then he'll just decide which one he want to do you may find he use one with his friends and use one with the teachers
S0199	i'm sure he will yeah
S0192	which i do around i drop my ts so
S0199	yeah
S0192	so i know what you're say
S0191	mummy
S0192	but i don't want you to confuse
S0199	yes darling
S0191	look
S0199	i can't darling i'm drive
S0192	i can see what's happen be he gonna fall oh oh oh oh oh he's stick on that be cool see i don't want you to confuse phonetic reinforcement
S0199	no no i
S0192	and grammatical reinforcement
S0199	well that's why i think i'd mention it because
S0191	oh look
S0199	i can do the grammar
S0192	oh
S0199	and i can and i've do start ever since you've say about it not correct just answer back with the right
S0192	yeah
S0199	way
S0192	he'll get it he'll get it
S0199	er but i've find it tough not to correct speech
S0192	yeah and that's that's your preference if you want him to pronounce his word in a certain way then that's fine but that's different to grammar
S0191	awesome
S0192	that's different to the structure he will never say i pizza eat even though you'd think they'd try these variations from the immediate that they start speak they'll always say and they'll probably start with pizza eat or
S0199	pizza
S0192	or i want i want or something
S0199	yeah
S0192	they'll never say want i
S0199	yeah
S0192	because they've already set those parameters
S0199	yeah
S0192	even though there be languages that say want i or eat or pizza eat so he's not gonna make those grammatical mistake in fact by the age of him now he's almost get all of his grammar he's pretty much get it all there's a couple of constructions that they find really difficult can i pull this down cos it's really bright in my eye one of the hardest things for children to get and i'll test it in a second
S0199	whose bottom's that
S0192	oh that's very smelly it's not mine
S0191	him
S0192	oh him
S0199	who's him the man
S0191	yes
S0192	one of the hardest things that children well one of the latest things that they have to learn be call passivise have you ever hear of the passive
S0191	hello
S0192	there be two type of sentence in english active and passive
S0199	i have hear of it but i be absolutely rubbish at remember
S0192	so for example i break the car be active passive be the car be break by me it's the same mean but we're change the object and the subject around no children if i say the car be if i remove me and i say the car be break
S0192	and i say
S0192	they don't know
S0199	hold on sweetheart
S0192	sorry er let me try and think of another example where it's no an cos that's an inanimate object so that make it clearer erm so for example the monkey kiss the lion the lion be kiss by the monkey if you ask them who do the kiss i the reverse one they can't tell they don't know that the lion be kiss by the monkey they still think that the lion kiss the monkey cos it's in that structure it take for them to learn that you can reverse the subject and the object and the lion be kiss
S0199	yeah
S0192	by the monkey be that the monkey's kiss the lion so it it it take that's the one of the last things that they learn but they learn it they still pick it up and you don't need to teach them that
S0199	that's incredible isn't it
S0192	it's just that they it's and that's part of our structure
S0192	in english we have syntactic structural mean that depend on how we order the word effect the mean that in english we go subject verb object the monkey kiss the lion subject verb object but other languages they could say the monkey the lion kiss and because they add an extra little sound so they add what's call a morpheme which could be the monkey o the lion e kiss and the o imply that the that's who do it and the e imply that that's who it be do to so then you can put it in any order because you've get a little thing that tell you who's the doer and who's the receiver we don't have that english so we have to structure it in a set way to say who's do what so we english and other languages be different and er apparently
S0199	very very interest
S0192	the children set those parameters as a child they can learn any language and through just listen those parameters get set and they go okay english be a language where i have to structure they're not consciously do that but it's a tacit it's er unconscious it's a fascinate theory isn't it
S0199	no it be it really really be
S0191	yeah
S0199	erm show how you can count be it count it in italian
S0192	you can count go on then
S0192	oh that be pretty good
S0192	i like that one
S0199	well do perform seal
S0192	yeah
S0199	as would say when i tell him to perform something can you remember it in french
S0191	no
S0199	to count
S0192	in this sentence
S0199	
S0192	can you listen in the sentence the zebra be kiss by the monkey who kiss who the zebra be kiss by the monkey
S0191	the zebra
S0192	so
S0191	kiss the monkey
S0192	the zebra kiss the monkey see he get it the wrong way round they don't know that at the minute test him in another year and see what it be
S0199	interest
S0192	it be interest isn't it if you say the zebra be kiss by the monkey
S0199	yeah
S0192	he just hear the zebra kiss the monkey
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's strange isn't it
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's good to be able to test it cos another year or two and he will he'll know that you you won't have a problem
S0199	try and remember that sentence
S0192	yeah
S0199	and we'll ask him again what do you have for tea what do you have to eat
S0192	oh do you break it do you want me to try and fix it
S0191	it have to go through the
S0192	oh it do shall i try
S0191	don't mind
S0192	oh i tell you it would break didn't i these things always break
S0199	what do you have to eat
S0191	have to eat
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's never gonna he's gotta fit that in there sorry
S0191	nothing
S0192	it's game over
S0191	why
S0192	because you're right the hole's too small and the man's leg's too big so you can't fit that in there it doesn't fit but what you could do be pull the other leg out and then he'll still work maybe but at the minute he's break
S0199	normally they get all fluffy and then you can't use them at all
S0192	so if i ask him the toy be break by he'd know that break the toy because there's only one way round it could be
S0199	yeah
S0192	that a toy can't break him so therefore it must be this way round
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	but with the zebra kiss the monkey either one can kiss each other so
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	so it can go either way
S0199	so then they just hear in the first
S0192	yeah and they do that experiment with a whole bunch of children and they sit them down and they get you know different things and
S0192	they ask them and clearly the children prove that they couldn't tell which way round it be all they know be it go the doer the verb the receiver
S0199	really interest it be interest listen to you and talk
S0192	yeah
S0199	she ask the right question and then i just sit back and listen
S0192	it's good
S0199	it's nice if she be less crazy
