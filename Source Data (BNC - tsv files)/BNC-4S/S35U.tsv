S0038	like a hot air balloon
S0083	and it
S0038	mm
S0083	and it
S0038	mm
S0083	rise up like a hot air balloon
S0038	mm
S0083	yeah
S0038	yeah it's something to do with that paper
S0083	yeah whatever the paper be yeah
S0038	well er i think it become so light with the heat of it just make it rise
S0083	yeah but it's a specific kind of paper isn't it
S0038	mm
S0083	it's always amaze when it happen though you think oo
S0038	you'll probably get this straight away but it's another one of those puzzle like that but there's a there's this boy who's drive and he's drive his father somewhere and they have a car accident his father be kill outright and he's in a critical condition and when he's lie on the operate table the doctor say i can't operate on him he's my son

S0086	i don't know
S0083	can you work it out
S0038	it's so simple it's not true

S0038	you could see but you couldn't see anything

S0038	that you know that'd be it
S0083	i mean i i don't know how
S0038	i suppose until the magnify glass come out
S0083	i don't know how long they've be do that um you know make lenses
S0038	well
S0083	i mean it's for quite a long time
S0038	i think the first one the first one well actually it er i think it's attribute to galileo who get a a cannon ball and a sheet of glass and grind
S0083	grind it yeah
S0038	grind it with a cannon ball and make a curve lens
S0083	right
S0038	well that be to make um
S0083	his telescope

S0083	yeah
S0038	to see things at you know out at sea
S0083	mm

S0038	uh um
S0038	mm
S0083	so do you think you can get out some of the picture that you have pack away
S0038	probably
S0083	in the garage
S0038	i be i be just think about that god know where anything be but probably yeah
S0083	the thing that bother me be that in order to get everything in you do your pack your good pack where you actually you know slot and pile and
S0038	mm
S0083	so it's all
S0038	oh well
S0083	pile on top of each other so if there's anything you want at the bottom
S0038	i know
S0083	you've have it
S0038	well i really would like the i don't know be the monitor in there you haven't see it here
S0083	i've just i've get the the the box
S0038	i think the speakers be in there as well
S0083	yes now you the speakers be in there cos i remember you say
S0083	i wonder what be in a bag and and um but if you'd you wouldn't have pack the monitor away you would've give it to me cos i've get the keyboard and the and the box
S0038	okay
S0083	cos you say i don't wanna pack those away look after them have them in the house which i have
S0038	i think it's in there somewhere
S0083	where would you have put it though
S0038	don't know just do you think i know anything that day i be just
S0083	but something as delicate as that you wouldn't have just shove it
S0038	it's not delicate it's just a screen be like um you know it's about that big black
S0083	huh well you would hopefully would've put it in something
S0038	mm
S0083	you know wrap around dunno
S0038	let's not think about it till the morning
S0083	okay that's fine okay we'll do that we'll have a look
S0038	um
S0083	but i would like to have some of your picture on my wall
S0038	i'm sure i can find those
S0083	i would love to do that
S0038	i think there's a big um
S0083	well i've get
S0038	what do i put them in
S0083	the big one of
S0038	mm i put them all in something i can't remember what um tut i can't remember what we'll find them er he say optimistically
S0083	oh yeah
S0038	mm
S0083	so in your on your little break you could er get on with something that you're
S0038	well i have i've get
S0083	mm
S0038	a i've get a kind of commission to do
S0083	yeah
S0038	which be um yeah it's a thing that do you remember years and years ago i go on a on a yacht in the caribbean
S0083	i do remember
S0038	who um recently get marry david go to his wed and promise to give him a wed present and he have say what i want more than anything be a portrait by
S0083	aw
S0038	of him and his wife so i'm do that which be a negotiation between and myself which be kind of
S0038	er not financially brilliant but i could live there for months on end without pay any bill
S0083	oh really
S0038	yeah
S0038	which be handy at the minute
S0083	so it might be worth do okay
S0038	yeah er and but also the other reason it's worth do be because um he will show it off to all his millionaire friends
S0083	yep
S0038	so you know
S0083	that's very good
S0038	which be very ruthless of me but you know
S0083	no i think you i think you haven't be ruthless enough i think you should've
S0038	i haven't really you know
S0083	see you're too nice
S0038	it's a shame that i get to that point with hastings where er you know the flat be sort of
S0083	tut i know
S0038	i have a studio up the road and i start work again and then it all
S0083	i know
S0038	crash down on me but there you go
S0083	i know
S0038	life eh
S0083	yeah it's a bitch
S0038	mm interest it will come back
S0083	i certainly think
S0038	oh
S0083	that bite at the bottom that you could actually have a solidly brick
S0038	build a
S0083	a brick or at least you know
S0038	you could er there's er
S0083	air brick
S0038	no but you need plan permission
S0083	not air brick um what's the word call breeze block that's what i'm think of
S0038	yeah
S0083	um
S0038	you need plan permission though
S0083	oh yeah but i'm sure i'd get it
S0083	for a studio
S0038	for a studio at the bottom of the garden
S0083	absolutely load of people do there's
S0038	of course they do yeah
S0083	every other house in um certain areas
S0038	you could build a bloody house there
S0083	er have get what in
S0038	if you come in a bite
S0083	every other house in in you know romsey and those sort of place
S0038	mm
S0083	have get a studio at the bottom of the garden cos it's just full of artists
S0038	well
S0083	i i it wouldn't be a problem at all
S0038	no look into it be good for you a little summer house
S0083	well it yeah it would be nice and it'd be you know i mean it would be somewhere also where you could just stick a bed as well so
S0038	mm
S0083	for people um
S0038	mm the guest house
S0083	stay absolutely
S0083	yeah or at least some power i mean it would need power down there
S0038	well power yeah i mean mm
S0083	i don't know how you'd do that
S0038	just put a cable under the grind and
S0083	yeah
S0083	yeah you'd need you'd need that
S0038	er i be just think that i haven't buy a lottery ticket yet but
S0038	cos um build a house there on my wag would be er interest
S0083	well i mean it's a nice idea i mean
S0038	mm
S0083	i'm sure somebody could do it there be actually permission plan permission she get er to extend the house out across here but i don't think i would ever have the money to do it
S0084	so if they grant permission for that they're likely to grant permission for
S0083	er of course
S0084	another project
S0083	i'm i'm sure they would
S0084	on the on the lot so
S0083	absolutely
S0038	it depend i think it you'd have to be careful about the height that it wouldn't er obscure their windows and things like that
S0083	but if it's if it's
S0084	it'd be single storey
S0083	single storey
S0038	well it could be the height that it be now really
S0083	absolutely
S0084	like the fence
S0038	mm yeah
S0083	and er just a slightly pitch roof
S0038	yeah
S0083	so long as it's not completely flat it doesn't have to be
S0038	well you'd have it just go one way
S0083	yeah
S0084	mm
S0083	exactly
S0038	and have an apex roof
S0083	oh absolutely
S0038	mm mm
S0083	yeah
S0084	a house that i go to look at recently have a studio little
S0083	yeah
S0084	outhouse shed but
S0083	well dido's get one
S0084	much nicer at the back of the garden
S0038	mm
S0083	at the bottom of hers
S0084	yeah and it probably be about that width
S0083	yeah
S0084	cos you have a second room with like a bedroom bathroom
S0083	oh right
S0084	yeah it wasn't all one it be there be two room
S0083	wow
S0084	it be really nice the guy build it himself i think
S0083	yeah
S0084	the guy who own the house
S0038	you could i mean that would i dunno be a couple of thousand pound worth of timber to i mean it's still a couple of thousand pound isn't it it's a big area isn't it
S0083	i mean if you didn't want to move it's er it's there's plenty of room you're not you're not
S0083	lose anything off the garden
S0038	just build your own house
S0083	well
S0083	i'm a lot of people be very handy and do it in the their weekend their spare time er you know
S0038	yeah
S0083	i mean a lot of men like a kind of project like that
S0038	mm
S0083	so
S0038	nice to build i mean er breeze block's horrible you'd have to render it and paint it or something but
S0083	well that's no but it'd look nice
S0038	but wood would be nice
S0084	wood would be really nice
S0083	well it would but you'd have to treat it and keep it
S0038	not really you
S0083	you know
S0038	mm
S0083	well you do cos it i mean it get it doesn't wear
S0038	no well you buy a treat timber you know like green timber and then and then keep paint it every year you know
S0083	mm
S0084	wood with those doors that slide the windows that slide all the way
S0038	oo now you're talk
S0084	along
S0083	mm
S0084	so the whole of the front would open
S0083	i that would be very nice
S0038	yeah
S0083	mm
S0038	yeah
S0084	solar panel
S0083	yeah oh that's an idea actually yeah
S0038	solar panel
S0083	yeah
S0084	cos that would run that and probably your house
S0083	and then
S0084	and they you could sell it back to the grid
S0083	er actually yeah because then rather than power go that way
S0084	power from here
S0083	it would actually be go that way
S0084	yeah exactly
S0083	cos i've get nowhere to put
S0038	mm yeah
S0083	solar panel on this cos i'm in a downstairs flat
S0038	no
S0083	so it would be quite good
S0084	so all of the roof could be solar panel
S0083	absolutely that would be good
S0084	you could put it and obviously that's the end that get the most sun
S0038	be they
S0083	it do
S0038	do they still do grant for it
S0083	the government have just cut them all back
S0084	of course
S0038	mm
S0084	but you can get
S0083	but i'm not gonna it's not gonna happen like in the next year or so
S0084	cavity wall insulation
S0083	so
S0038	no i be think of buy some tobacco and a lottery ticket
S0083	oh
S0038	so you never know
S0084	and a few thousand pound worth of timber anyway
S0038	well that be after the lottery ticket
S0038	mm ah cos er there be that syndicate be there thirty of them and they all get one point three million each
S0084	nice
S0038	hm it be like fifty million something like that
S0083	i mean the odds be obviously ridiculous but as nan always say
S0038	somebody win
S0083	somebody's get to win it
S0038	yeah mm
S0083	and somebody do
S0038	well it's the odds be bump into a complete stranger and guess their phone number
S0084	really
S0084	good good
S0038	you know same chance of that happen
S0083	oh right okay
S0083	really there be more number in a phone number that's not
S0038	well
S0083	oh
S0038	six figure number
S0083	okay yeah
S0038	but then
S0038	it's kind of true isn't it
S0083	yeah yeah
S0038	and the odds be exactly the the odds be that the same chance that it turn up one two three four five six
S0083	yeah
S0038	as any other number
S0083	yeah exactly
S0038	bizarre really but you know well that's why they make an awful lot of money
S0083	well of course
S0038	very few people get a lot of money but
S0083	exactly
S0038	it do sort of make very few millionaires it's not
S0083	oh darling don't you start
S0084	mm
S0038	oh don't get poorly
S0084	mm
S0083	i think it's probably time to go indoors
S0084	mm
S0038	have a lie down for an hour or so till till you have to drive off and pick up
S0084	i think if i go to sleep i won't will never get up again i should do some star jump or something
S0038	well lie and watch something
S0038	have a little rest
S0084	what's the time
S0038	it's five o'clock
S0083	mm
S0084	okay
S0083	we have
S0038	be she allow to turn off the music and watch something
S0083	we have a yes i mean we could er absolutely
S0038	mm
S0083	no and i share similiar taste
S0038	mm
S0083	in what we watch 's harder
S0083	's impossible
S0083	um i think you and i probably
S0038	pretty similar
S0083	agree with a lot of
S0038	yeah
S0083	yeah
S0038	mm
S0083	but it's quite tricky find something for everyone to you know that we agree on
S0038	oh i do see the most bizarre film on this free channel um good god what's it call i've forget now what it's call now
S0083	who be in it
S0038	er nicole kidman
S0083	mm
S0038	who i think be quite astonish actually she's brilliant
S0083	i like her in certain things i really do
S0038	she's in this she's amaze and it's the most bizarre film about a woman who's a the film begin i've see this actor before but i don't know his name crop up in sort of you know he's one of those actors who you see his face but you don't know
S0083	yeah
S0038	his name so he's just about to get marry and he's say it's take me you know five years to get to you know for her to say yes and she say yes you know and you realize the reason why be because her husband die suddenly and she be so in love with him that you know she'd never be with anyone else and as they're celebrate in their luxurious new york apartment this little boy walk into the room and say that he's her husband and er it's er really spooky and weird and it it's kind of and um it get to the point where the little boy's parent say he's not our little boy any more he's your husband and it it be it's quite out there you know it's like wow
S0083	when be it make
S0038	don't know can't think what it's call i suppose put in nicole kidman and then
S0083	yeah you'll see a list of film
S0038	um it be call oh god it it sound ridiculous but it's actually quite move and intrigue you know it's like what in god's name be gonna happen here
S0084	it's a bite like benjamin button i suppose be it
S0038	a little bite
S0083	i haven't see that
S0038	in that way yeah a little bite in that way
S0083	er i mean i i know the idea but
S0038	but and the kid be absolutely fantastic he's such a good actor
S0084	so how old be he then he what age be he play
S0038	about fourteen or something like that
S0084	oh
S0038	no it's it it's kind of
S0084	do it look like it be quite old
S0038	no not that old
S0084	mm
S0038	i'd know that
S0083	how how long ago do you think it be make
S0038	it's quite hard to tell um dunno
S0083	uh
S0038	within the last ten years maybe i don't know
S0083	i mean i don't know a lot of her film so
S0038	be there a list of title
S0083	yeah
S0084	it won't be anything recent i don't think
S0038	right
S0084	cos it doesn't ring a bell with me
S0083	well she's be make film for a long time
S0038	i think it didn't er i think it possibly didn't do very well and it's just on one of these kind of
S0083	how old do she look
S0038	film channel
S0083	do she look
S0083	okay so er um this be this year last year
S0038	no er the interpreter i've see er birth it be call birth i think i'm sure click on birth yeah

S0038	ten year old boy yeah it be call birth
S0083	a reincarnation of her dead husband
S0038	yeah yeah
S0083	how bizarre

S0083	cameron bright
S0084	mm pass
S0083	dunno danny huston be in it lauren lauren bacall she's i mean you'd know quite a few of the people in it i've never hear of this film
S0084	be it from a play cos the name sound familiar
S0083	no
S0038	it's very clever because um obviously everyone's like hysterical about it and say
S0083	two thousand and four
S0038	don't be so absolutely ridiculous this boy cannot possibly be your your husband your dead husband but the more question they ask him
S0084	mm
S0038	the more freaky it get because he know everything
S0084	my god
S0038	and it it's kind of what in god's name be happen here it's like he can't be right
S0083	that's weird
S0038	it's very very clever
