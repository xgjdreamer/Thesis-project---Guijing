S0328	i think like to me be like sound like it be like a long long long day of like read and formalities and this and that then a few highlight be like the nice things
S0331	yeah
S0328	probably as a kid i would have super love that
S0326	it take like hours to read through all the stuff put this one the chickpeas
S0328	mm mm yeah
S0330	tuscan's be know as bean eaters
S0330	i just remember hence the situation love them bean
S0331	well this man
S0330	oh yeah
S0326	you see that guy just have a siesta on the beach
S0330	yeah
S0328	yeah
S0326	i want some fat
S0331	yeah
S0326	fat and
S0330	i it's a big salad
S0330	yeah man
S0326	what do it have in it
S0331	tuna
S0330	tuna tomato chickpeas bean
S0330	why why be it again you can't have lavender bread in
S0326	because they have to leave in such a rush
S0330	that's it
S0326	didn't have time to let it rise it's like on the side of the matzah crackers it's like it's only it's only kosher
S0330	kosher
S0326	kosher well i call it kosher by accident it's only kosher if erm you've only be it's only be in the oven for like eighteen minutes or something
S0330	really wow
S0330	but surely you can have like like normal flatbreads cos they only take like three minutes to cook right
S0326	yeah
S0330	do the matzah cracker people just have a total monopoly over passover
S0326	probably
S0330	yeah
S0328	they have them in the freezer
S0326	and they
S0330	cos that's the thing that you get like
S0326	all that food be like bless by rabbi's in the warehouse
S0330	oh of course it have to be bless
S0326	so a rabbi'll go around like mutter and down the
S0328	that's it in the factories in saudi for halal they have but like really really fast forward for the prayer and then to like like do you chicken in along and they drop it and then as it fall it's like to prayer
S0330	yeah yeah yeah
S0331	you'd go crazy work there if it's just speed up record all day
S0328	mm
S0326	happen when you go to the factory there
S0328	just read about it go to some like chicken farm and stuff and stuff like do i tell you not like nice condition if it's halal necessarily just like the
S0331	man
S0326	be halal be it similar to kosher
S0328	yeah
S0331	yeah well the bless and you know the
S0328	it's just for like the kill of animals
S0331	yeah
S0328	so kosher just sound like it's crazy like like from the begin
S0326	yeah
S0328	like how long things be cook for
S0326	well boil three egg at a time only
S0328	only only three
S0330	no i think halal refer to lot of other aspects of normal life as well i think i don't think it's just come out in it's like old stuff because that because i guess both kosher and halal be like you know like rule by which you're mean to live life you know cleanly and you know in more ways than just like morally or whatever
S0326	yeah
S0330	they're just guide book i think
S0328	you might be right i don't know
S0326	i think i think you'd go totally mental though follow all the rule
S0330	yeah yeah
S0326	do you watch that documentary about like find love in stamford hill
S0330	no that sound cool
S0326	there's like this one like like this new jew and he's try to learn it but there's so many rule he's always mess up
S0330	oh man
S0326	and break the jewish law
S0328	do find love
S0326	he be try to find a wife for his son but he's he's have to cos he's be to prison
S0331	the son
S0326	no the father
S0330	what for
S0326	like tax something to do with money anyway
S0330	right
S0328	take evasion
S0326	they they go to israel and he find one in israel but it's all weird it's like company in israel that be design just matchmaking company and the go and meet the they go up have like ice cream together if it's all like and all the negotiate be do not through the couple who be their their parent on the phone
S0330	oh
S0326	and they're like yeah it's like yeah she like you she like you she want to go and have another date
S0330	so crazy
S0326	his other son find out why normal or he be work in a shop and then meet someone
S0330	erm
S0326	must
S0328	be it nice the
S0326	yeah it's weird it's kinda funny though
S0330	i be tell that
S0331	cool
S0326	it's like
S0330	i be tell a couple of funny things about orthodox jewish community and particularly the one in i'm not sure whether i guess there be lot of different type of orthodox jews right be there
S0326	probably yeah
S0330	different school
S0326	yeah
S0330	whatever but they have this thing where firstly they make have to make love to a sheet with a hole in
S0326	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0330	yeah
S0326	i think you say sheep
S0330	no through a sheet through a sheet with a hole in second
S0328	really hot
S0330	but secondly like like part of there's something to do with erm
S0326	the problem be if you go to wash out and all the sheet some of the sheet have hole in them
S0330	oh man that's really crazy
S0326	for real
S0330	erm but the other thing be that like be it's the husband's duty to satisfy all the sexual desire of the of the wife
S0331	oh fuck hell
S0330	so so like which be like
S0331	sound tough man
S0330	so they have to so at any like at any moment
S0328	no matter what
S0330	when they wanna have sex the woman want to have sex
S0326	they're not allow to touch they're not allow to see each other though
S0330	but they're not allow to see each other
S0328	oh not like any desire that she have or
S0330	no no no
S0326	what be she want what if she want to see him
S0328	yeah
S0331	yeah
S0330	yeah
S0330	that's not allow
S0330	be kind of funny and cool
S0331	the sheet thing we can do it if you want
S0330	no
S0330	not the sheet the the husband's duty
S0331	oh yeah yeah no it's good
S0330	no it's just funny why it doesn't work the other way round

S0326	like when they have to shave their head after they're marry
S0330	yeah and then they have to wear wigs right
S0331	yeah
S0326	the wigs be quite nice though

S0330	a wig a wig
S0328	no
S0330	sheet with a hole
S0328	if i go dress up i'm go dress up as one of those women with the really big hat you know

S0330	see those ones they're really good
S0326	yeah they look really heavy
S0330	yeah they do look quite heavy what i don't understand be though that the dress code be be base on like what be it like sixteenth century lithuanian dress or something
