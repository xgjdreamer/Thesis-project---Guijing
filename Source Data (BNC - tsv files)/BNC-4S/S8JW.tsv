S0040	we have a pizza with bake bean on it
S0094	it's quite exit
S0040	it's veggie breakfast pizza
S0094	mm
S0040	disappointingly didn't have any sausage on
S0094	ah
S0001	ah mm
S0040	yeah yeah
S0094	that's a shame
S0001	it's an interest concept so we'd think we'd try it
S0094	mm
S0001	but we feel i don't think if we take it further
S0040	it be just
S0094	yeah need to go like
S0001	yeah the whole hog
S0094	do it have some hash brown on
S0040	no see that's what we
S0001	no
S0094	oh
S0001	and no egg either
S0040	that's what we exactly what we say
S0094	no egg
S0095	we're like what kind of veggie make this pizza
S0094	be it just bake bean and normal pizza then
S0040	i know
S0001	bean mushroom tomato

S0001	but that be that's about it you're like oh we've gotta push it come on
S0094	okay mm
S0094	yeah
S0040	tasty because the the
S0095	find like mushroom dry on an average pizza as well so
S0001	yeah
S0094	yeah
S0001	so just really the bake bean be the novelty
S0040	the bake bean do add something
S0001	yeah
S0040	they do you know
S0094	mm
S0001	but i feel like like they could've go for the fry egg thing on it you know
S0094	mm
S0040	fry egg in the middle a bite of hash brown and veggie sausage round the outside with a big crisp on it
S0094	mm
S0040	would've be good
S0001	anyway we might try this ourselves some time
S0094	mm
S0040	yeah
S0001	and you know go that extra mile
S0094	yeah
S0095	be a good idea i'll get some
S0094	mm
S0095	pizza for breakfast
S0094	mm
S0095	mind you hold that handle while it come towards me
S0094	oh okay
S0001	yeah so two two small nieces up in newcastle my nephew erm
S0094	oh
S0001	with my family 's baby it's
S0001	be a lot of a lot of small children you might find it a bite traumatic
S0040	it's a bite 's baby be like relatively young
S0001	five months isn't it so
S0040	five months so it be no bother cos we just go to the pub
S0094	mm
S0001	yeah
S0040	and take the baby and then we be play some sort of qi relate card game at her house until ten or something whilst drink beer with the baby
S0095	what's qi
S0094	mm that's alright then
S0040	what
S0095	what's qi
S0040	it's like a questiony oh sorry it's a tv programme it's like
S0095	oh
S0040	questiony like humorous
S0001	shall i give you a scoop
S0094	yeah we escape all baby and almost all relatives
S0001	except for the sister
S0094	yeah that's fine though
S0001	that's acceptable
S0094	yeah
S0040	yeah
S0095	so you do have lot of phone conversations
S0094	oh yeah my mum ring nearly every day until new year
S0001	just to check up on you
S0094	yeah i don't
S0001	cos you're cos you and your sister be in one place she think she think she'd like maximise
S0094	well there be that but it be go on before she come as well
S0095	would have message to tell to your sister maybe well that be part of the reason
S0094	no that be the like flimsy excuse of it
S0094	sometimes
S0095	mm mm
S0094	sometimes it's like just really i think it be because she be feel a bite kind of funny cos she be quite sort of
S0001	thank
S0094	she's look after cos he's just have a triple heart bypass and stuff so
S0001	oh
S0040	mm
S0094	erm yeah i think she's feel a bite kind of like she's not able to do anything else apart from that and she's stick in the house a lot cos he can't really
S0040	yeah
S0094	they have to go out for walk but that that's all they he can do
S0001	oh
S0094	she have need to do all the cook which she's like really hat and can't do
S0001	be that usually his role
S0094	yeah
S0095	so he must be quite piss off with that as well
S0094	yeah
S0094	but that's why my sister be on about those box that she get with the spice and the recipes be you there for that bite
S0095	no
S0094	maybe not no but my mum really like them well that's what she try to cook for us she's you send off for these things they're box they're like
S0095	get in there
S0094	ten quid and you get like four or five recipes with four or five packets of spice that go with them
S0001	oh okay
S0094	and they you do add the spice to the ingredients that they tell you to and just do that which
S0040	okay right
S0094	i mean she have the one er all of the recipes be meat ones and we didn't have any of the ingredients and they didn't even seem like they'd be that transferable
S0040	well they didn't have any for me
S0094	no
S0094	erm so i go no we're not have any of that here look here's a recipe this one
S0094	but erm but my mum really love it and like
S0001	mm
S0094	yeah cos she's not very good at season anything so just whack a packet of something into clear instruct like things be like just what she want really so she be quite happy
S0040	mm
S0001	mm
S0095	what so your mum
S0094	mm
S0094	mm quite hot
S0040	just try to work out whether it be the fact that i'd slather that bite in hot mango chutney or what
S0001	yeah yeah
S0094	no
S0001	there be a bite of a tingle
S0094	i think it must be oh sorry my hand do slip a bite on that cayenne pepper
S0094	i think that's especially hot cayenne pepper cos i seem to have do that every time i've use it
S0095	mm
S0040	i think i've either get a jittery cayenne pepper hand or
S0095	i really
S0001	cayenne pepper can be pretty funky
S0040	quite like spanish food er be it spanish or
S0094	piri piri be it or
S0040	spanish or
S0001	it's just paprika
S0040	oh there we go we haven't touch that since
S0001	but
S0001	i have
S0040	have you
S0001	just well a tiny little drizzle occasionally you know
S0001	just of the oil
S0095	yeah it be a good pizza
S0094	i don't think i've ever eat a pizza so slowly
S0094	probably probably a good thing really what do you think any adaptions or
S0095	i would say it be a success
S0094	i think it's really nice yeah
S0040	yeah
S0094	crusty on the outside squidgy on the inside
S0095	all you need to do be like slim down the
S0001	it be quite complicate
S0094	oh be it oh
S0001	well you have to like start this little bite of dough overnight
S0094	mm
S0001	call the pre ferment
S0094	mm
S0001	and that's like a really like quite stiff bite that
S0094	right
S0001	have to like develop for like twelve hours
S0094	oh blimey
S0001	to get some structure go because then the the full dough mix be like really wet and sloppy
S0094	oh
S0001	and so then you combine that little bite with it which then add some add some kind of structure
S0001	but you still you can't like knead it out on a board you just have to do it in a bowl because it's so wet and
S0040	oh okay
S0001	so you're just kind of
S0094	boing
S0001	pull up these strand
S0001	of dough and er
S0001	it be quite but er
S0040	i do think you'd go mad cos i i look in that bowl last night when i turn off the light and i be like must've get the recipe wrong
S0040	nothing in here
S0040	smallest loaf of bread in the world or it's just gonna be one big air bubble
S0001	just have all these stag and then like every half an hour this morning i have to keep stretch it erm
S0094	every half an hour
S0095	it raise
S0094	wow
S0001	over the course of like two hours
S0094	yeah
S0001	just mean like you couldn't stray too far away
S0001	anyway it be good kind of
S0094	mm
S0001	fun to try so
S0094	wow i think when i do that french bread once many
S0094	years ago that be quite hard work but at least it be only within one day
S0094	mm
S0095	be it the sort of thing that you could like double up and make loaves of
S0001	er yeah i suppose so you just yeah maybe
S0095	you freeze it
S0001	yeah cos
S0094	mm
S0001	i think it's one that's quite good fresh isn't it so yeah but i suppose yeah you freeze it and
S0094	mm
S0095	mm that be good and hot
S0001	sorry
S0094	it's warm you up after a day outside
S0095	it's nice
S0040	that's the irony we've we've be sort of sort of inside sort of outside all day but it's all be with cold wet hand
S0094	ah
S0001	mm
S0040	just like all we've do all day be hit one rock
S0094	cold wet hand er
S0001	oh
S0040	and make it slightly smaller but not actually small enough
S0094	so couldn't you use that saw thing on it just to cut a nice line and that'd be do
S0040	yeah we do
S0094	erm but then those
S0040	yeah
S0094	little bits so
S0095	and and even that be quite
S0040	well
S0095	struggle
S0040	we just we'll just turn on the power drill bam bam bam mm it hasn't make any impact
S0095	the sds
S0094	oh
S0095	the sds be sort of like die a little bite
S0094	oh
S0095	slow action
S0094	to be fair i think we kill it downstairs a while back be it get near to die down there
S0095	i think so we replace the brush on it though didn't we
S0094	oh right
S0095	but then there's still
S0001	yeah
S0095	i don't i don't know why they would be dodgy again already
S0094	mm haven't do much since that with it have we
S0095	mm not load mm a fair bite of and stuff
S0094	mm
S0040	quite a lot of oil appear to be mm throw out the front of it
S0095	mm
S0040	which be slightly worry
S0094	mm
S0095	maybe it's the sds chuck maybe it's the chuck that's like not quite right
S0040	no
S0094	it's very very vinegary the piccalilli i don't really like it
S0095	i be mention that today
S0094	oh
S0001	yeah guess what we've get a jar as well that's the problem
S0094	oh
S0095	i quite like it but
S0094	be it the same
S0001	i think i i do like it but i take the point it be it be quite vinegary
S0095	who who didn't didn't like it but do
S0094	yeah
S0095	who bring it who bring it
S0094	erm do i think
S0095	yeah but then didn't seem to like most things really
S0094	he wasn't fussy
S0095	well that's what he say but then he didn't like most things
S0094	well we didn't serve him anything that he didn't eat
S0001	be he a carnivore
S0094	yeah yeah he be like we go and have fish and chip like out and about like when we go around at one point and something else that's another point
S0095	i be hop you be gonna say he like
S0001	mm
S0095	sneak out at three in the morning
S0001	mm
S0094	for a for a steak
S0094	somewhere kebab no well not that i know of couldn't've
S0001	do you have a good christmas dinner
S0094	yeah we didn't like
S0001	veggie work
S0094	yeah pretty much
S0001	you didn't let him sneak any meat in
S0094	he wasn't here for christmas they
S0001	mm
S0094	come at like on the twenty seventh and stay until like new year's eve so
S0001	oh okay
S0094	erm yeah but christmas dinner be good but we it be so sunny here it be like a really nice day so we didn't bother cook it until it have get
S0001	no
S0094	dark basically and then
S0001	that make more sense
S0095	mm
S0094	watch double bill star trek movies
S0001	oh
S0094	with christmas dinner
S0001	sound good
S0095	good move
S0001	mm we be slightly like regiment christmas day i think because of small children like
S0094	mm
S0001	so you have to eat at the middle of the day then like your brother want to cook for like one o'clock which seem very early for like a big meal
S0094	mm
S0001	i think and then and then there be dog to be walk in the morning too so it be
S0094	it be like right
S0001	yeah exactly things have to be do by certain time and er
S0040	yeah we didn't have to get to my brother's house until one o'clock for that for some reason that we have to go for eight
S0040	and then some of us have to drive away
S0095	yeah
S0094	that's what it's a bite like with my mum
S0001	we have to be in bed for twelve
S0094	mm that's quite extreme for christmas isn't it
S0001	yeah
S0094	mm
S0095	could you pass me a tissue from behind you
S0040	alright now here we go
S0095	it's normally on the window sill there
S0001	anyway i well i think he be the only vegetarian amongst eleven
S0094	oh
S0001	eleven adults on christmas day but what
S0094	oh do you get special treatment
S0001	oh i i make my own thing to contribute
S0094	oh
S0001	but someone else actually have the bacon
S0040	yeah
S0001	cos she didn't really like turkey
S0094	mm
S0001	so yeah
S0040	cos no one really like turkey
S0040	just eat
S0001	then why do you bother
S0040	because it's traditional
S0095	turkey
S0095	to have dry unsatisfying
S0094	be like oh you know what this could do with bite of turkey
S0095	turkey i mean turkey's nice dunno what's wrong with you
S0040	don't want to turkey that's what's wrong with you
S0001	do your brother follow in the tradition of overcook
S0040	no no it be the juiciest no it be the juiciest turkey that i've have in a long while
S0001	you like to overcook things doesn't she
S0040	yeah
S0001	she like the carrots to sort of melt as you bite them
S0040	i think melt's the wrong word i think she'd prefer if it be you put the fork under it and lift it through and just like pass clear through
S0001	just big mush
S0040	sort of
S0001	erm the worst thing be like the jacket potatoes because
S0094	oh
S0001	i kind of see the point be that you get a crispy skin
S0094	yeah
S0001	but she cook them just completely wrap in foil like the whole thing
S0094	oh so they're just gooey
S0040	yeah
S0001	so you just have this like soft oh they're just it's just not right
S0094	mm

S0040	you know some sort of or we be quite happily prepare to use a small child as like a think of the children hold it up against our head
S0001	think it be this one
S0095	mm

S0094	he's quite nice
S0040	erm but it be actually completely fine the only thing we didn't have be any erm sage
S0094	mm
S0001	chestnuts
S0040	well we didn't have any chestnuts
S0094	mm
S0001	but i get enough in the end anyway so
S0094	didn't have any chestnuts or sage but everything else be fine
S0001	yeah they seem like apple
S0040	mm
S0001	and i'm not quite sure what else yeah
S0094	yeah it's alright quite like it really this chutney's good
S0095	i'd like erm half a ciabatta
S0094	yeah
S0095	to begin with
S0094	mm
S0040	you've spill a bite on your hand there
S0094	d'you want d'you want some butter d'you want any butter
S0095	yes
S0095	shall i get it
S0094	okay
S0040	hit me with a bite more couscous doubt that she'll hit me with it though
S0040	quiet
S0001	i'm just observe your mm couscous dish out skills
S0001	erm no i'm alright thank
S0094	what do you make for christmas dinner
S0001	erm
S0001	like a a nut loafy kind of thing but quite er a a a moist one i think
S0094	mm
S0001	it have like mash parsnip in
S0094	mm
S0094	that sound quite excite
S0001	to sort of help like bind it together and then
S0094	yeah
S0001	i put some blue cheese through it as well
S0094	oh
S0001	since
S0094	mm
S0001	since
S0094	that sound good
S0040	you couldn't particularly taste the well you you could tell that there be something about it
S0094	mm
S0001	so it be like mushroom and chestnuts and
S0094	mm
S0001	hazelnuts i think
S0094	mm
S0001	and then like some parsnip
S0094	mm
S0001	and then we do we do it in a loaf tin and then it have like sort of slice of parsnip at at the bottom
S0040	right er along right at the bottom of the loaf tin
S0094	oh right
S0001	so it's layer
S0040	like quite densely pack with
S0040	like parsnips
S0001	with partly cook and then you put a bite of sort of butter or something on that so that it kind of caramelise a bite
S0094	right mm
S0001	and then you turn it out and then you get this nice sort of parsnip on top afterwards
S0094	oh cool yeah mm
S0040	quite difficult selection of parsnip slice so it make a nice
S0001	but anyway i get do that bite cos you you like a bite of precision work
S0040	sort of
S0040	it's a bite of panel really
S0001	be good
S0094	i go a bite overboard with our nut roast make it like completely friendly to everybody but actually only us eat it in the end i make it
S0094	vegan and gluten free but which consequently mean it didn't really hold together
S0001	oh
S0094	it taste alright but
S0001	mm
S0094	but then only we eat it in the end anyway so
S0095	think my sister have a bite
S0094	no because
S0095	yeah
S0094	we didn't like go to extreme lengths of clean everything oh and her her tummy felt dodgy so that's the main excuse
S0001	be it your sister who's gluten free
S0094	mm
S0001	yeah mm what's erm what's she up to be she teach
S0094	erm she's still do the teach thing in hull
S0001	yeah
S0094	count days literally until she can quit
S0001	oh
S0094	which isn't until the summer but she's also do a master's in education and leadership or something as well so
S0094	as if there wasn't enough work to do there
S0001	oh wow
S0094	she get some special deal cos she's on this teach first scheme so
S0095	leadership
S0094	mm
S0001	she's gonna be a leader
S0094	mm
S0001	of some kind
S0094	of the revolution hopefully
S0001	so be she she's not want to stay in teach
S0094	erm
S0001	or be it
S0094	i think she want to she want to get out of that school
S0001	oh okay
S0094	i don't think she want to stay in it for very long but i think she want to try do it a nicer school
S0001	i imagine it would make quite a big difference
S0094	mm cos she's at one of these like really rough academy place and yeah sound completely rubbish
S0001	mm
S0094	in every way
S0001	it's good
S0001	i'm eat
S0040	yeah
S0001	duh duh duh
S0040	i didn't think i be cold but now
S0001	now you're warm up or
S0040	it's like bits of me be go oh wait a minute
S0001	you thaw
S0094	sit against the radiator as well
S0095	oh yeah i mean to do that
S0094	we'll swap
S0095	no i'm warm now
S0040	we're go back to your parents' weird phobia of central heat
S0094	oh
S0040	i think they don't know how to set it
S0001	like set the time properly
S0040	yeah
S0094	mm
S0040	it's get one of those wheel things
S0094	oh like we've get
S0040	yeah
S0094	mm
S0040	but i have a look at it just before we leave
S0094	mm
S0040	and it's set as if it come out the shop
S0094	oh no way
S0040	like everything's in perfect corner
S0001	i don't know about that
S0040	no so i wonder if it's just the fact that your parent think that the heat can only come on for four hours and then it go off again by itself
S0001	can't be that lame
S0040	i dunno
S0094	there's like there's quite a lot of like research be do into energy behaviours about this kind of thing there's like a period of time when you've get a new system or a new house that you get to know it and you try different things and stuff and if after that like you haven't sort of sort of get into some sort of thing that's good that's that's just what you accept and that's it
S0040	that's it yeah
S0094	like then you don't bother
S0001	mm
S0094	well that's like a what a lot of people do anyway erm
S0040	yeah it be it's evidently not that well an insulate a house
S0001	mm
S0094	mm
S0040	erm cos it it's that the extension extension's awful
S0001	new extension for the garage yeah
S0040	erm but then all room feel cold really really quickly as soon as
S0040	whatever heat in them's go off but then it's the fact that they it'll be we put the heat on cos we felt cold yesterday oh i'm warm now and i'll turn this radiator down i'll turn the heat off and so
S0094	and so it's like
S0001	cos
S0040	there's there's like there's never there's just
S0094	so they do fiddle but not in a sensical way
S0040	there's never just
S0001	mm
S0040	yeah but it's just like
S0001	mm
S0040	it's too hot in here i'll turn the radiator off and it's like now it's cold well we'll put the fire on
S0040	it's like the thermostat doesn't stand a chance
S0094	yeah
S0040	yeah half the half the room in the house be
S0040	sort of ten degrees and the other ones be at twenty that you're sit in with a fire on and the thermostat's set to eighteen in the corridor which there's
S0040	no heat or all the doors be shut to it
S0001	it's like my mum say she doesn't like the heat come on in the morning she doesn't like it to get like hot in the bedroom
S0094	mm
S0001	she's in
S0094	but they could just turn the radiator off in the bedroom
S0040	that's what make you think
S0001	but then wouldn't you just turn the one off in the bedroom and then have the rest of the house get warm
S0040	or
S0094	mm
S0001	for the
S0040	yeah
S0001	morning
S0040	and that's what make me think they don't know how to set it properly because you would be able to set it to not come in the morning and just come on in the afternoon if you want to
S0094	yeah
S0040	but i mean our
S0001	i don't know parent be crazy
S0040	i do try and understand their heat system previously but it be just like there's there's eight time the amount of copper here that there need to be i don't have a clue what's go on
S0094	ah
S0001	your parent be kind of funny as well
S0040	my parent be exactly the same
S0094	yeah
S0001	not quite in the world of heat but they're odd in their own ways
S0040	yeah everyone's parent be odd in their own ways
S0095	the nature of parent
S0094	mm mm
S0094	indeed
S0001	your dad be disappoint that we be in the small car and he couldn't give you lot of stuff
S0094	oh
S0040	mm think he be more disappoint didn't get that other car from work
S0001	oh
S0040	i think the the last couple of days just descend into a bite of a free for all
S0094	oh be it actually the end now properly
S0040	he's end at his
S0094	oh be it actually the end now properly
S0040	he's go
S0001	yeah he's

S0001	but but they just look quite ugly
S0094	yeah they don't usually look that nice
S0001	mm

S0040	well we take get a nice
S0094	mm
S0040	erm
S0095

S0040	er no it be just like small like rods so it be like straight shaft straight from the motor
S0095	oh right
S0040	yeah
S0095	yeah
S0040	didn't know quite how useful that would be i can really think it would be
S0095	well like a dye grinder or something
S0040	yeah i couldn't really think when i'd want to use it
S0095	i imagine that would be quite useful
S0040	that much
S0095	the dremel er metal work like a dremel be really good but it's not quite it's just not quite enough yeah
S0040	big and powerful enough yeah i just sort of think anything bigger and more powerful you just you get to the point where it's just anything on a rod like that you gotta think you know you know if you just seem like you'd go and your rod thing would just grind into a v shape
S0095	mm i guess it depend what
S0095	and you can get some good aggressive like tungsten burr type things that
S0040	yeah yeah
S0095	be quite good for shape
S0040	yeah well i know about that but then there be also an eighteen volt cordless erm band saw
S0095	band saw what what like a one that you just like a small band like that that you can
S0040	yeah literally a band saw about that big that you can just
S0095	i think they i'm really like interest in that i think it might be really good for rip
S0040	so that's what i be think
S0095	like really big plank cos you can't manoeuvre a big plank to a band saw but you can
S0040	no
S0095	easily
S0040	but i have a sneak have you eat them all already
S0095	what's go on what
S0094	there's not really enough cocoa for a hot chocolate erm can i mix in some of the posh hot chocolate and that'll be enough then
S0095	yeah that's almost enough anyway
S0094	alright great
S0095	quite nice muffin things
S0094	d'you like them
S0095	yeah i see what you mean about them probably be nicer yesterday though i think they'd be really good with cream
S0040	the chocolate mulberries be delicious i can see why you eat all of them
S0040	yeah so i be look at i be think well in theory the the cut face bite doesn't really matter whether it's small or portable or a massive workshop one
S0095	mm
S0040	as long as it's get enough power to it's only that bite that interact with whatever you're put it into isn't it so
S0095	yeah
S0040	but i be just wonder it's sort of like quite a lot of friction and stuff but like it's quite tight bend to get it into a hand build unit
S0095	yeah
S0040	i just don't know i can imagine if
S0094	this stuff's really nice as well
S0040	it's basically a an electronic hacksaw isn't it for metal stuff be what i'm imagine people use it for rather than rip cut a massive piece of wood
S0095	oh i be imagine piece of wood act a bite like a chainsaw mill in a kind of you can set
S0094	like flavour when you
S0095	like through i just imagine you could adjust like something from the through
S0040	it really wasn't really wasn't that big it didn't look that much bigger than like the jigsaw
S0095	so you couldn't like have a plank like that and
S0040	no
S0095	i'm sure i've see ones like that though
S0040	no yeah
S0095	but whether they're cord i think that'd be really cool i mean it's sort of in between a proper band mill and a
S0040	mm appear to have make there be like the jigsaw like my one and then that one that you've get that be like the other handle
S0095	oh yeah
S0040	they've make a cordless one of those as well by the look of it
S0095	yeah cordless jigsaw as like one of the most useful things don't you
S0040	yes
S0095	yeah so
S0040	in fact i would say it's probably almost as useful as the drill
S0095	wow mm
S0040	just in term of it's the thing that you most likely in my head it's the thing you're most likely to cut through the cable of
S0095	i see what you mean
S0040	yeah
S0095	yeah
S0040	yeah i mean i yeah i very very rarely use my cordless circular saw
S0095	oh right why's that then
S0040	dunno it's just it hasn't get quite enough oomph
S0095	yeah
S0040	it's just get you've get all that it's like today that your one be bind up
S0095	yeah without a guide they're like
S0040	yeah
S0095	circular saw they're just a bite of a nightmare in a way
S0040	yeah so yeah it really can't cope with it the depth of cut on it er and if it if it even if straight and true depth of cut be worse than the jigsaw in a way because you're try to force a massive chunk through
S0095	mm then you're twist
S0040	yeah yeah and it sort of
S0095	out doesn't it
S0040	yeah so i really struggle to go through like just like do odd angle on a deck timber
S0095	right
S0040	that didn't like do it whereas the jigsaw will just fill you know
S0095	cut through
S0040	yeah mm
S0095	yeah click saw be pretty great that's what i use to like break down all the gas bottle and like that sort of thing when i be
S0040	mm
S0095	make a stave it seem to work load better than the angle grinder even with like a small disk on the angle grinder doesn't
S0040	yeah
S0095	cut as fast and they do kinda munch through the blades which be quite expensive
S0040	on the yeah
S0095	yeah
S0040	yeah erm b and q's get a sale on erm
S0001	don't mention that
S0040	i only mention it cos they have some quite long sds drill bits and i be consider get some long ones
S0095	right
S0040	but they also have a flip massive core drill
S0095	like diamond core drill
S0040	yeah
S0095	oh right
S0040	be like thirty odd quid i dunno how good it'd be
S0001	aha
S0001	gonna have
S0094	the remainder of my sherry
S0040	double tea bag action what be go on here
S0094	well i be just get the leftover of those two teas
S0095	mm nice hot chocolate
S0001	mm
S0094	be it good
S0095	it's so good i might have to dip a muffin in it
S0001	oh this look nice
S0040	mm they be good muffins
S0001	maybe i'll combine it with a bite of
S0094	they they're very healthy muffins
S0040	mm mine with the mulberry be an an excellent choice yeah
S0001	oh oh yeah
S0094	put a couple of mulberries on there
S0001	that sound good
S0094	those be great those things they only seem to exist inside of christmas present it seem to me
S0001	mm
S0094	i've never see them anywhere in
S0001	i don't actually know yeah
S0094	yeah that's all
S0001	i don't know where it come from
S0094	probably
S0095	be it a present
S0001	yeah buy us like a little foodie hampery kind of thing
S0040	i wouldn't be surprise if they're in the shop at
S0094	mm
S0001	oh
S0040	they their place then
S0094	mm
S0094	i still never be in there
S0040	it's really good
S0001	mm you should go in there
S0040	it be it be genuinely really good it be like oh this be probably the widest range of vegetarian items
S0094	mm
S0040	in and it's not even in
S0001	and it's yeah
S0040	but they also have like nice bread
S0040	it have all that nom er welsh chocolate
S0094	oh right
S0040	stuff veg look good
S0094	mm
S0040	freezers be well stock

S0040	caf√© be
S0094	mm
S0095	mm oh yeah
S0040	two thumb up
S0094	mm mm
S0095	say these be a bite nicer than the ones your sister have
S0095	they be for some reason they be all really like pathetically small your sister's ones
S0094	mm they're bigger ones these ones
S0001	so mulberries be kind of like raspberries be they or i can't remember what they
S0094	no well i dunno really
S0095	they've get sort of punch about them
S0040	no mulberries be the ones off a mulberry tree aren't they
S0095	yeah
S0001	so what
S0094	they look a totally different colour but
S0001	what do they look like fresh
S0095	it's cos they're cover in chocolate
S0094	mm
S0040	well i can't really remember cos the the the thing off the tree look like a a beech nut but
S0001	er
S0040	like a beech nut case but bigger doesn't it which these look absolutely nothing like
S0001	i don't really know
S0095	do it i just think it look like a berry interest
S0094	mm shall i google it
S0040	yeah
S0094	google picture of mulberry
S0040	mm put those further away from me
S0095	double chocolate
S0094	i'm gonna put them inside
S0001	your parents' house be never short of wine or chocolate
S0095	which which parent
S0001	's
S0095	ah
S0001	's mum
S0094	mm
S0001	which be good
S0040	although again we have to go and buy beer
S0095	outrageous
S0094	mm
S0094	disgraceful
S0001	just keep the good wine
S0095	it's true my parent give the most awful of any alcoholic beverages
S0095	if there be any there'll be the cheapest horriblest ones you can imagine
S0040	erm
S0094	now they look like oversized blackberry stroke raspberries
S0040	ah i'm evidently wrong then
S0001	okay yeah i suppose that's vaguely what i think they look a bite like
S0040	what be i think of then
S0094	mm
S0040	what be i think of
S0001	erm
S0094	tayberries
S0001	of er medlars
S0040	that's what i'm think of
S0094	medlars
S0095	medlars
S0040	yes i'm think of something completely different now that i think about it
S0001	medlars
S0094	i don't know what they be
S0040	they're like
S0001	they're a slightly weird
S0094	do they grow here
S0001	like they get call dogs' be it dogs' bum or something
S0040	yeah
S0001	it's cos like the end of it it be kind of indent and it give the impression of one i'm sorry for the record
S0095	dog's bum
S0001	something like that or be i i don't
S0040	yeah
S0001	but erm it's weird you have to let them slightly it's call bletting isn't it be it they start to get slightly rot or
S0040	yeah
S0001	ferment or something and you you you you kind of have to let that happen and it actually like soften the fruit or do
S0094	mm
S0001	something and that's when they're best to pick apparently
S0094	mm
S0040	seem like one of those things it's like oh god there's so many rule and things like
S0094	mm
S0040	you have to plant the tree and then it like at least eight years before you get a crop
S0094	mm
S0040	about so
S0095	mm
S0094	mm
S0095	so we be suppose to give my parent the walnut tree
S0094	oh bummer
S0095	i bring two present back for
S0094	mm
S0095	they're in the car
S0094	mm
S0095	one of them's a clothe item the other one's a clothe item
S0095	er probably get a nice fleecy
S0094	oh i saw the present they didn't look big enough to be a fleece
S0095	no but there'll probably be like a fleece nest or something
S0094	anyway sock surely sock
S0095	no too for sock
S0095	lovely snicker
S0001	what be your what be your parent like at at present choose give
S0095	mm fairly awful
S0001	it's true
S0094	occasionally they'll come out with something useful they're better at it for you than they be for me which be fair enough as well
S0095	what have they give you versus me
S0094	they give me that terrible fleece
S0001	should i risk a second muffin
S0094	for my birthday
S0095	get in there
S0001	do you want half the muffin
S0095	i'm on my second
S0040	i could eat half
S0094	oh a hit
S0095	yeah
S0094	for they do have hardly any fat
S0095	feel like i
S0094	and hardly any sugar
S0095	not any fat what be that all about
S0001	you sound disappoint
S0040	ah
S0040	there's part of me think what's the point of eat it now
S0095	exactly
S0040	it's like
S0094	well it's get lot of cranberries in it and banana good for you
S0095	ah
S0095	banana
S0094	it's hide banana cos it
S0040	it's well hide banana
S0094	cos it be go way past the point where i like them
S0094	cos i need to hide them
S0001	that banana bread beer be strange have you try that one
S0040	oh that that
S0094	mm banana bread beer
S0040	mm that wasn't good
S0094	mm
S0001	erm
S0040	in my non banana opinion
S0095	doesn't sound very good
S0001	so yeah it really taste very banana ish
S0094	mm
S0001	like a like an ale er yeah yeah you didn't like it do you
S0040	it be like an ale with a banana dip in it it be like that
S0001	me me and drink it it be alright
S0040	a lot more accurately it be like a beer with a refresher bar drop in it
S0094	mm
S0001	it do have that slightly
S0095	interest
S0001	slightly
S0095	but like that sound a bite nicer somehow
S0001	i know but that kind of artificial banana flavour
S0040	yeah
S0094	that's even worse than banana
S0095	banana y real banana
S0094	mm those things that have the other day i have one think it be gross but then i be actually really hungry and keep open and eat them
S0095	you be devour them
S0094	they be quite nice after a bite
S0001	be use to them yeah
S0095	be like that
S0095	yeah
S0095	and then you just keep eat them
S0095	nice
S0094	i like the texture of them
S0095	mm me too they remind me of er
S0094	they be sort of
S0095	mango things
S0094	mm
S0095	dry mango
S0094	they be like dry banana chip but they weren't like those crunchy chip ones they be sort of chewy a bite toffee ish
S0001	okay
S0040	mm okay
S0001	i think we get the worst present from my brother
S0040	yes
S0095	what be it
S0040	world of warcraft expansion pack
S0001	well no just a terrible like must've be on offer in boot toiletry section
S0094	oh no
S0001	so get some horrible
S0040	i i
S0001	and i get something
S0094	no
S0001	and then a
S0001	clearly re gift bottle of really bad white wine that they don't drink
S0001	wine so they just think they'd give it to us and er
S0040	but it look like
S0001	and we put effort in and we'd buy them that qwirkle game we be describe earlier
S0001	and it be just like god
S0094	mm
S0040	yes er
S0095	toiletries
S0094	mm that be really bad
S0001	just ironic cos when me and my brother be younger and then you know he use to get buy a lot of lynx box set and we would you know go on about this how it be really crap and he would end up with like five
S0001	and now and now he's he's start to give them out it's just ah
S0094	that's all wrong
S0040	i don't even think they be on special offer at boot i think they be just probably on the end of the aisle at the supermarket
S0095	sure it's not just one they'd have for years
S0094	mm
S0095	cos he'd have so many of them when he be younger
S0094	mm
S0001	maybe
S0040	it's the flavour of peace
S0095	what lynx
S0040	mm
S0094	if that's the flavour of peace then
S0040	oh that's where i
S0094	oh dear
S0040	i i can that's where i can use it up i'm gonna come down and just spray it in front of the peace choir and morning
S0001	oh no no
S0040	increase the peacey ness
S0001	ah
S0095	i think that would be quite amuse
S0040	ah i would wanna get like
S0001	they will all hate you a lot
S0040	i wanna get the opinion that i'm
S0001	like
S0040	and then the peace choir can tell me if it smell of peace
S0040	in body deodorant form
S0094	i've get a feel some of the peace choir might get violent
S0095	that would the ultimate ironic
S0094	say lynx this be really what your peace be like
S0095	yeah
S0094	raar rag hippies
S0095	peace choir
S0095	yes
S0001	ah
S0095	that'd be a good advert at the start of the cinema
S0001	yeah
S0040	no i'm not entirely sure what peace smell of but i don't really wanna activate either of the things
S0040	one of those things i'd have quite happily just drop it straight in the bin if it wasn't
S0095	pressurise
S0040	to get some sort of use out of it
S0001	cos lynx be just associate with i dunno gang of like eighteen year old boys in ben sherman shirt and i can't i can't see
S0095	it's very true
S0001	i can't see the association with peace
S0040	no
S0094	mm
S0040	i dunno it's widen their vocabulary at least
S0094	it be quite funny actually my sister like didn't do an amaze job with some of the present in that be you think like you do know me and quite well as in we don't really like sweet things and their gift to us for them stay be a bottle of mead
S0001	ah
S0094	which we didn't even put on the it be like no we hate that
S0001	god
S0094	maybe slightly too harshly
S0095	no it be alright it be better to to do that cos they've
S0094	yeah
S0095	take it away with them now
S0094	yeah that's true
S0094	no can't remember what there be there be some other sort of sweet things i mean i'm just sort of think
S0095	er come on it wasn't bad it be quite good
S0094	it wasn't that bad no no yeah yeah but it be like mead
S0095	that's pretty much as sweet as you can get on the drink front
S0040	you need a lot of gin to with mead
S0094	yeah
S0001	i reckon baileys be like sweeter than mead
S0040	yeah
S0094	yeah
S0001	and whether the creaminess help
S0095	yeah the creaminess do help
S0094	the creaminess do help
S0095	creamy mead
S0001	god
S0094	mm ah do you see that massive tub that we have in the kitchen we've get like a litre ice cream tub we have that much cream over christmas
S0001	cream every day

S0095	just assume he be gonna go off to the fridge and get like you know just a an average tub out and he just come back with this massive ice cream thing full of clot cream
S0001	well
S0095	we be like mm mm great
S0001	that be like your best present i should imagine
S0095	i be very please
S0094	his face be something
S0001	oh
S0095	that be a pretty excellent present
S0095	it be quite unexpected
S0094	mm yeah cos like wow how much d'you want for that and he be like no just take it
S0001	oh have you become regular customers
S0095	erm pretty much i do sort of go there or have be go there most fridays on the way back
S0094	we decide to cement it by give him a christmas card
S0040	oh crikey
S0094	say thank you for the yummy milk moo moo
S0040	thank like you know beyond family member ish do we actually send any christmas card slash do you send any that i wasn't aware of
S0001	yes

S0040	we do have a couple of those where it's like a text message where do you live and you reply back say now send me yours
S0040	and they don't and you're like oh
S0094	mm
S0095	mm
S0094	do you wanna play a game
S0095	erm
S0094	we have two excite new game
S0095	do we
S0094	yeah
S0095	what be they
S0094	we've get jungle speed safari
S0001	woah and your hand take
S0095	i could just about cope with jungle speed safari the other one's a bite like long and thinky
S0094	oh okay the other one's quite cool cos it's collaborative maybe we could play it another time
S0040	okay
S0094	like you win together or you die together
S0001	like everyone
S0094	yeah
S0001	oh well
S0095	remember we have a good game of what be it what be it call the game we play like the other day
S0094	cosmic encounter or something
S0095	oh cosmic encounter that be quite good we we have a good game of that the other day
S0094	there's alien erm
S0095	it's alien and kind of meet other species and negotiate with them or attack them and blah blah blah blah but yeah me and collaboratively win in the end which be good
S0001	cool
S0095	and be call 's race be the cudgel
S0094	i be i be erm a race call the cudgel which make me to smash people up
S0095	special power like
S0094	so we go for one mega smash then everybody hat us forever and we didn't have any more good card so that be the end of that basically
S0040	yes manage to find a game that be incredibly simple to explain
S0040	well your parent still didn't get it
S0001	no it's just my mum
S0095	what be that
S0040	the qwirkle one
S0095	oh right
S0040	the one with the big
S0095	your mum didn't get it
S0040	one and a half rule
S0095	yeah well well i get it and i didn't even see any of the piece and
S0094	yeah
S0040	yeah i manage to explain it to use paper
S0001	it's just like tile with different shape of different colour like there's six shape and six colour and you have to kind of make row of either match colour or match shape
S0094	right
S0040	that's not the correct way of explain it
S0040	it's scrabble but with colour and shape rather than word
S0095	actually it's very much like the mensa game
S0094	be it like the mensa game yeah
S0095	only with you know shape and colour
S0094	right
S0095	rather than just the shape
S0094	yeah
S0095	but
S0001	i think scrabble's mislead cos there's not a board
S0094	no
S0095	that be my only confusion when be explain it
S0040	but that do make me think i could make a qwirkle board
S0095	you could have with special like
S0040	that would add add complexity to it in the future
S0095	yeah with special tile
S0094	mm
S0040	yeah
S0095	that you wanna get or not
S0040	mm
S0095	that could be
S0040	so it's
S0095	the add on pack
S0040	it could be
S0094	mm
S0040	yes
S0094	expansion pack
S0040	cos then all we need be a hundred and four or a hundred and eight can't remember what three time thirty six be
S0001	a hundred and eight
S0094	yeah
S0040	so we just need a hundred and eight identical bits of tile or wood
S0095	yeah
