S0688	just er just off just off the
S0689	get to speak up
S0687	it's okay
S0688	just off the courtyard in sponza palace be in dubrovnik be the room in which the victims of the nineteen ninety one ninety two siege be commemorate to most visitors the photograph of dead teenagers bomb build and the tear remnants of a croatian flag from mount serge provide a shock reminder of the realities of war a young country stay in one of the buzz coastal resort in summer and you could could be forgive for forget the most important fact about croatia that this be a young country which emerge out of a former yugoslavia and be still recover from the war that tear it apart little over twenty years ago head inland to vukovar all the serve villages around and the scar of war be there for all to be see in the burn out house and pockmark facades the emotional damage be less visible but it exist all the same the few croats and serbs who remain in these areas share only share an uneasy peace lead separate live drink in separate bar and send their children to separate school and they all use live harmoniously before
S0689	be it to do with stalin
S0688	i don't let's read on in many ways croatia be still in denial about what it call the homeland war the first war memorial be in inaugurate in two thousand and six in zagreb's mirogoj cemetery replace a pile of bricks erect on a street corner by families of victims most politicians prefer to focus on the future portray croatia as a modern forward look european nation but the world be not so easily convince talk on become a member of the european union be hold up in two thousand and five over croatia's inability or unwillingness to track down fugitive general want by international war crime tribunals in the hague many soldier accuse of war crimes be still regard as heroes in croatia in hindsight the war of nineteen ninety one to nineteen ninety five be an inevitable consequence of the breakup of yugoslavia the country have be hold together by president tito from eighteen ninety two to nineteen eighty
S0687	no that's how long he live
S0688	yeah okay a
S0687	i think that
S0688	a croatian communist fighter who come to power in nineteen forty five
S0689	just after the war well start of the war no the second world war
S0687	forty five's the end
S0688	yeah
