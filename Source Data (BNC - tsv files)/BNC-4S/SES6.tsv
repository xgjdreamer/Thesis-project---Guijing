S0058	ah yep so you press it twice
S0432	ah
S0058	it's record now
S0432	thank
S0432	so it be as simple as press it twice
S0439	okay right
S0439	don't worry i'm not very technical either
S0432	yeah
S0439	so don't worry about it
S0432	so have you do many record for things already do most of it so it's not me
S0439	i think i've do like maybe ten or something like that ten or eleven
S0432	ah that's good
S0439	they're normally kind of with similar people like with my housemate cos we kind of i live with her but it's really hard to actually spend a lot of time with her
S0432	yeah
S0439	cos like i'm always out go to like the gym or something and she's always out do something so actually pin pin each other down to spend time together that's really difficult
S0432	yeah
S0439	so i kind of use it as an excuse to like pin her down
S0432	yeah
S0439	and it's be really good so
S0432	oh that's yeah actually time to catch up in general anyway
S0439	yeah exactly
S0432	even if it's not like record or anything
S0439	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0439	yeah exactly like
S0432	ah
S0439	cos we move in together in january and then the kind of we just didn't really see each other for like four months which be really weird
S0439	she's my housemate but er and she's my best friend from school so
S0432	oh so you already know each other
S0439	yeah so it's be quite good that way and some of them with my mum but my mum rant so much and i've have to like stop it sometimes
S0432	yeah
S0439	cos she end up have like an argument i'm like i don't want to listen to this
S0432	it's not it's not a conversation
S0439	no
S0432	it's just them talk for age
S0439	it's just them rant it's like this be not good mum
S0439	what be you do erm
S0432	yeah
S0439	i haven't actually do any record with any guy which i think i don't know if it's a bite weird cos i have quite a lot of guy friends but just
S0432	mm
S0439	i dunno i haven't make
S0432	yeah
S0439	do any record for men it make me sound i i say to i be just like i hope it doesn't matter that there's no like male profile but it's okay
S0432	no i think at the moment it's pretty even so it doesn't matter too much i mean
S0439	mm yeah
S0432	it's slightly more i think there's slightly more female
S0439	yeah
S0432	speakers but
S0439	yeah
S0432	it doesn't matter too much as long as it's generally go balance anyway it's fine
S0439	yeah it's just weird like some of the things you end up talk with your like what you talk about with your friends and how you talk like most of the time i don't even finish sentence and they automatically know what i'm gonna say and then they start talk
S0432	yeah
S0439	and you listen to it and you're like this this isn't even a coherent conversation
S0439	like what be we actually discuss but
S0432	yeah it's quite good when you read it
S0439	mm
S0432	it totally doesn't make sense
S0439	yeah
S0432	but then obviously it make sense to you at the time like you obviously know what you're talk about
S0439	yeah you need context it's really peculiar
S0432	yeah
S0439	but it's really interest to do what be you actually gonna do with the data
S0432	we be just gonna add it to the
S0439	yeah
S0432	our corpus that we've get already
S0439	yeah
S0432	do you i don't know if you
S0439	i i know like bits of it but like be it you're just try to track like which word people use and stuff like that
S0432	yeah and how we erm just if it differ to how we write and
S0439	mm yeah
S0432	if it's change cos we've get a nineties nineties dataset as well
S0439	yeah
S0432	so we're compare it as well to see what
S0439	yeah
S0432	we check like what topics we talk about
S0439	yeah i've see the board
S0432	yeah
S0439	and things
S0432	oh that's good
S0439	that's really cool
S0432	yeah
S0439	yeah
S0432	erm yeah apparently we talk about education twice
S0432	as much now than we use to and stuff like that
S0439	oh okay
S0432	but erm and then eventually we'll use it to erm like teach learners
S0439	mm mm
S0432	how we talk now
S0439	yeah
S0432	so they we they get teach up to date stuff
S0439	yeah cos like the french like i remember like the french i be teach at school be horrendously formal and didn't really make
S0432	yeah
S0439	any sense to a french person when we speak to them
S0439	it be like why's this person speak really formally
S0432	yeah
S0439	like one of my friends here be french and like we be talk not in french but i be try to tell her like tell her stuff we learn and she be like people don't speak like that at all so
S0432	no no no when i be learn spanish and learn spanish as well
S0439	mm
S0432	and you you're really proud of something that you've learn
S0439	yeah
S0432	and then you go to spain and say it and they're just laugh at you like
S0439	yeah
S0432	what be you even say
S0439	like you obviously learn these at school
S0432	yeah that's something like my grandma would say or something
S0432	cos it's just so old and not even like worth know any more
S0439	isn't teachers be like now people say this this be a very common phrase you're like no it's not
S0432	no
S0439	if it be it be a common phrase when you be like fifteen years old
S0432	yeah when you learn it
S0439	now you're like fifty so
S0432	it's not gonna work
S0439	no i've never be very good at languages i always try and i just can't do it
S0432	oh really
S0439	can't do it at all like my sister she's like she's a complete einstein baby you give her a language and she'll try it she'll learn it and she'll pick up word
S0432	yeah
S0439	and by the end of the day she'll be able to formulate sentence and everything if you ask me like no
S0439	i just can't do it i can like
S0432	yeah
S0439	i think in german like my godparents be german so i've be go to germany every year for my entire life and all i can say be can i get down from the table and can i have some water
S0439	that's pretty much the extent of my german
S0432	that's good that's useful
S0439	so yeah you can tell that i learn it from a child
S0439	so
S0432	yeah
S0439	that's not it
S0432	yeah well they say like you have to have a certain brain for it
S0439	yeah
S0432	or like so
S0439	yeah
S0432	i i dunno if that's actually true but
S0439	well my sister if you give like a maths like question she wouldn't be able to do it for you like
S0432	mm
S0439	she her brain just can't process maths or it can't work out how to solve a problem like that
S0432	yeah
S0439	but in languages she just completely click with it
S0432	yeah
S0439	so yeah
S0432	if you learn it you'd know it kind of thing
S0439	yeah
S0432	whereas you can't yeah i think
S0439	and like she's live in like china and she's live in france and she's live in germany and she love like japanese film like annie may and things like that
S0432	mm
S0439	and she just she can just speak it and i'm just like how do you do that

S0439	and that translate into a mean and that yeah
S0432	yeah it's almost like a syllable i think

S0432	mm
S0439	and you play a game on it all the time
S0432	mm
S0439	she do literally nothing else with it apart from maybe some email so like that's a
S0432	yeah
S0439	worthwhile six hundred pound investment there mother
S0432	i don't i dunno if it's just me but i don't i only use it to kind of go on the internet
S0439	yeah
S0432	i don't use it for like email or

S0432	no i don't really use mine
S0439	like i get it at uni so i start uni in two thousand and nine and finish two thousand and twelve yeah so it's like maybe a good what six years old now and it just take so long well not really long it take like a minute to load but it's like
S0432	yeah
S0439	it's a long time
S0432	it's longer than an ipad
S0439	yeah it's
S0432	like we're so impatient aren't we now
S0439	yeah exactly yeah
S0432	it's like why be you take so long
S0439	and like it's just a bite of an old laptop and by the time i've get it load and up and everything and the battery's i be one of those stupid people that leave theirs charge all the time so now it have no battery
S0432	oh yeah
S0439	so i just i don't even use it any more and it's just sit under my bed and i really but then you don't i don't really need it any more cos i have like a computer at work when i need to check things i have my phone

S0439	yeah exactly yeah and you can get netflix on the tv which i love
S0432	yeah
S0439	although it take me a while to work out the other day how you log off someone else's account and i have to embarrassingly go and ask my housemate how to log out
S0432	i don't even know how you do that
S0439	yeah
S0432	i just have mine sign in all the time
S0439	exactly

S0439	and her boyfriend come over and they obviously log out of my account and log into his account have a very peculiar erm name and i be like i'm guess it's and she's like yes it be
S0439	but erm and i be like how do i get out of it and she go oh you just sign out and i be like ten minutes later
S0432	oh simple
S0439	how do you do that it be like okay but yeah the thing be netflix now i find it so big that i kind of look on i go on like oh i don't know what to watch and then just log off again
S0432	yeah
S0439	i'm so bad
S0432	well i just spend like ten minutes scroll through everything like
S0439	mm

S0432	yeah
S0439	but i've start i have like a new year's resolution this year to complete series because i always end up like watch like the first how many

S0439	and then never finish them so i start
S0432	yeah
S0439	daredevil they have like a netflix original daredevil

S0439	but although i do think it's very weird that they still live together and yet still have a very good relationship i think if i live with my ex boyfriend
S0432	mm
S0439	i would hate it if he bring other girls home or date other girls so
S0432	yeah even if i still even if i didn't wanna be with him
S0439	yeah
S0432	it would still be really weird
S0439	be weird yeah
S0432	and
S0439	but i just love them so much
S0432	not yeah
S0439	and i love all the character there's not like there's not one that i have a favourite i just love all of them it's just so good
S0432	yeah
S0439	although be a bite weird last night's episode he cry a lot do you do you see it
S0432	i can't even remember oh cos they er winston they be like
S0439	new yeah the winston they want him to like get stab or something
S0432	yeah yeah
S0439	so stupid
S0432	oh dear i'm not sure like i'm i think i'm fine with schmidt and cece not be together like i'm not sure how
S0439	yeah
S0432	i don't want them to be together as much as i want jess and nick to be together
S0439	don't worry i'm not i'm not gonna tell you
S0432	oh do they get back together do they
S0439	yeah
S0432	oh
S0432	that's fine

S0432	huh
S0439	he's kind of like highlight his hair he look a bite weird
S0432	oh no
S0439	but i can't imagine him be a dad dunno i think it's cos of his character he's really immature but
S0432	yeah yeah
S0439	i assume he's absolutely nothing like schmidt cos schmidt be crazy so
S0432	yeah i always think that i be think it last night actually like i wonder what they're like in real life
S0439	yeah
S0432	and if i'd actually like them more or less
S0439	i think i'd like them less just because you like their character so much don't you i dunno
S0432	yeah that's true like unless they're exactly the same
S0439	yeah i have a he's not really a friend he's like somebody i go to school with and he play he's in eastenders
S0432	oh right
S0439	i haven't see it or i've see him like once and he's not a very good actor sound horrible but he's not
S0439	and his name in in real life and i think in the show he play someone call like or something like that
S0432	mm
S0439	he's like an indian person and erm in the show he play a nerd like a really geeky shy person and genuinely in real life that's exactly what he be like
S0432	oh really
S0439	so when i like saw him on tv it be just like well he's just play himself
S0432	yeah
S0439	he be really weird to see
S0439	i sort of watch it for like five minutes and like no can't watch this
S0432	yeah
S0439	i be like you're just not very good
S0432	oh no
S0439	i apologise if you like eastenders
S0432	no i don't watch it
S0432	i dunno who you're talk about
S0439	yeah he's just i think yeah it's just cos when he be at school he use to like brag about it so much so i watch it i be like there's a reason i don't watch this show turn it off
S0432	have he be in it for age
S0439	yeah since i be in sixth form and so since yeah about two thousand and eight i think he's be in it
S0432	oh yeah
S0439	so quite a while
S0432	yeah that be a long time i suppose
S0439	still haven't watch it
S0439	never go to i think i watch it like years and years and years ago but can't really remember
S0432	mm i only watch it with emmerdale and coronation street cos
S0439	yeah
S0432	my like use to watch it or something
S0432	and then we like we watch it with her
S0439	yeah
S0432	but i don't actually purposely put any of them on
S0439	i don't actually watch any oh that's a line don't judge me again but i watch neighbour
S0432	oh do you
S0439	yeah
S0432	i be so my boyfriend's cousin watch it and she like rant on about it all the time and i'm like i didn't even know it be still like go
S0439	yeah it's definitely still go they have their thirtieth anniversary this year yeah
S0432	do they
S0439	yeah
S0432	oh wow
S0439	like me and my housemate we like watch it it's like you know when you have like your best friend and like things that you weird things that you do together
S0432	yeah
S0439	neighbour be like one of our weird things that we do together so like
S0432	yeah that's fine
S0439	we could like have like have a few months break sometimes and then the other person might watch it and fill in and then we'll all be watch it
S0432	yeah
S0439	it's one of those things you can not watch for months and you put on and you know exactly what's happen
S0432	yeah
S0439	it's not it's a bite shit to be honest but it's really good
S0439	it's like awfully bad no
S0432	yeah
S0439	awfully good
S0432	yeah
S0439	i dunno something like that but yeah
S0432	yeah but sometimes like i think if i do start watch like coronation street or something i'd probably want to keep watch it cos
S0439	yeah
S0432	you do just wanna like know what happen next and
S0439	get really involve don't you
S0432	yeah
S0439	well it's really weird like i always think it's strange erm when you when like a character die and then like people mourn them you're just like
S0432	yeah
S0439	why be you mourn a character
S0432	yeah
S0439	but then i realise you know i think it be two days ago harry potter's son apparently start school on the first of september there be like a
S0432	what his real son
S0439	no no
S0432	
S0439	it's like a character erm it be in the news like j k rowling be like oh harry potter's son be start school today good luck and it be basically like
S0432	oh
S0439	a fictional concept that harry potter
S0432	oh
S0439	be now old enough for his son as cos like at the end of the last book or something
S0432	yeah
S0439	jam go to school or one of them go to school and that be his first day at school
S0432	they do have kid they be send them on the
S0439	yeah
S0432	hog hogwarts express or something weren't they
S0439	and apparently continue the whole fictional story he he go to school on monday and that be that be in the news and i be just like
S0432	that's so weird
S0439	what and there be like people in real life who be tweet hope jam have a good day or first day at school it's like he's not a real person
S0432	really
S0439	he's he's a fake what
S0432	it be i cos i i think i saw that on like facebook or something
S0439	yeah
S0432	but i didn't read it
S0439	mm
S0432	and i think she be just do like a sequel or something
S0439	yeah no no it be just
S0432	but it be just that
S0439	fictional moment in life cos like i be talk to my friend cos my friend be like well how old would that make harry potter and i be like i don't know so we google it and apparently accord to the story or her like chronological order harry potter be bear in nineteen eighty so he's now like thirty five years old
S0432	oh no
S0439	i know
S0432	what i think he be like twenty five at like the most
S0439	yeah i be like cos i assume i read it when i be in like when i be ten or something so
S0432	yeah
S0439	i be like early two thousands i kind of assume it be he be like really young
S0432	yeah
S0439	like my age cos when you read it you associate you associate yourself with him
S0432	yeah i think that be the same for me like
S0439	yeah
S0432	you feel like you grow up with them so he should only be
S0439	yeah
S0432	our age now
S0439	exactly yeah and you're just like oh harry potter in the fictional world be really old
S0432	yeah
S0439	great
S0439	i just didn't understand how this fictional character just mean so much to people but
S0432	mm people get really like attach don't they
S0439	really into it yeah
S0432	what like what would they find
S0428	hey how be you two
S0439	good how be you
S0432	shall i stop it or shall i just that's fine
S0428	carry on that's alright what have you be up to just have a chat
S0439	just have a chat about erm harry potter
S0428	oh no
S0432	and people get so do you hear about the er harry potter's son start school on monday or something
S0428	no
S0439	do you not oh it be in the news
S0432	and apparently people get like really like ah like
S0428	excite about it
S0439	yeah
S0432	and like say good luck to him even though he's only a fictional character
S0428	that's ridiculous
S0439	like genuinely be really weird
S0428	that be mental
S0439	why do people even care
S0432	it be isn't it yeah
S0428	yeah and what what
S0439	yeah exactly
S0432	there's there's nothing else to say like what
S0439	no it's like and people just like ha hope you're have an amaze day at school wish i be there it's like it's not real
S0439	what be wrong with you
S0432	she's get to do a sequel now where jam be at hogwarts
S0439	yeah but the thing be what could happen
S0428	it's just gonna it's just gonna ruin it
S0439	mm
S0428	just just stop
S0432	yeah just stop
S0439	that last chapter completely just be wrong anyway like she shouldn't have write it
S0432	mm
S0439	i think or she shouldn't have write it so like cheesily i dunno
S0432	yeah
S0428	mm
S0439	but yeah
S0432	i think it's just to like end it somewhere wasn't it like
S0439	yeah
S0432	i've get to end it otherwise it'll just carry on for age
S0428	right it's go alright
S0439	yeah also end it i think in quite not a childish way but for children cos obviously she start it for children and then it get really quite dark in some place quite adulty
S0432	mm
S0439	and i think she kind of have to do like a bite of a loop and end it
S0432	yeah
S0439	on like a nice notion like an american end
S0432	yeah
S0432	but i think like as we be say like the fan grow up with him almost
S0439	yeah
S0432	like obviously he grow a little bite quicker
S0439	yeah
S0432	erm but so maybe her audience like change anyway cos
S0439	yeah yeah would have do
S0432	we adults
S0428	yeah
S0439	yeah
S0432	like we start watch and read it when we be younger and then we grow up we
S0439	mm
S0432	obviously didn't want it to be like childish any more
S0439	no
S0432	some people might
S0428	just imagine have that idea though and it just
S0439	i know
S0428	explode and the whole world be suddenly in your imaginary world it's a bite like
S0439	yeah
S0428	woah there
S0432	yeah
S0428	like it must be quite weird
S0439	and also judge your imaginary world like oh i wouldn't have do that like that or that's wrong or
S0432	yeah
S0439	that wouldn't have really happen hypothetically it's like it's fiction
S0439	like
S0432	just let it happen
S0439	yeah just leave her to it
S0428	yeah just all the
S0428	i'm just gonna go and see what's happen but erm
S0432	okay
S0428	carry on no one we've get all
S0432	have we
S0439	everything's full
S0432	yay
S0439	cos it must be so hard to get people to come in and like participate in things
S0432	yeah we it's at first like we be do almost an hour at first we be just stand there like
S0439	ah
S0432	twiddle our thumb like no one's come but then we be like it's fine people go and have their lunch and then they'll come in
S0439	they'll come
S0432	but i mean it's not too bad i we we're get a few in so
S0439	yeah it just
S0432	a lot of people say they'll do it and then have like don't turn up so
S0439	yeah
S0432	you can't judge like how many people be actually gonna do it
S0439	yeah cos things like i think one of the things that i kind of think while record be i plan to go and meet one of my friends and i'd be like okay so i'll record that meet and then something would happen like the pub would be too noisy or
S0432	yeah
S0439	something like that and you're like okay this isn't really gonna work tonight so
S0432	yeah
S0439	it's like obviously didn't have to like the perfect situation but you want to try and get a good atmosphere don't you but
S0432	yeah yeah and like we try to do it we try and do some at like lunchtime sometimes
S0439	yeah
S0432	and we just generally forget like
S0439	yeah exactly
S0432	we finish lunch but like oh should have record that
S0439	yeah yeah
S0432	so we totally understand that it be hard
S0439	mm mm
S0432	to like do it all the time
S0439	but it's still yeah like i say it's nice to get people together look
S0432	yeah
S0439	do you mind if i just have a chat with you and record it
S0432	yeah
S0439	and i think it's quite funny at time cos you first people notice they're be record so they say things and they're like they you can hear them in their or not you can see them think like should i say that how should i say that
S0432	yeah
S0439	and then actually they get like really relax into it and then they come out with like a complete
S0432	yeah
S0439	crappy like bollocksy sentence
S0432	yeah
S0439	and start swear and they're like oh crap be i suppose to be able to swear damn it
S0432	yeah
S0439	but no
S0432	yeah that i think people be aware like oh what do we talk about
S0439	yeah
S0432	but it's not even the topics it's like the you're aware of the topics but
S0439	mm mm
S0432	the way you say it be the bite we're interest
S0439	yeah
S0432	which be the bite that you can't really help so much
S0439	mm mm yeah
S0432	like whatever you say it's gonna come out
S0439	mm
S0432	almost naturally anyway so
S0439	yeah yeah
S0432	you can't adjust it too much
S0439	i know it it's strange though when you're say about how whether the write word be different from the speak word because mine be so different like
S0432	yeah
S0439	i be very british in my email i think like i'm very not formal but i'm very like nice and like
S0432	yeah
S0439	i do a lot of fluff and i use you know like i could definitely have like
S0432	yeah
S0439	i can reduce my sentence dramatically by just take out word and make them less nice and stuff
S0432	yeah
S0439	but then when i speak i can try to like i dunno i just yeah and not as coherent
S0432	yeah
S0439	email always much more structure aren't they
S0432	yeah and you can go back and like change what you've do or something
S0439	yeah
S0432	when you can't when you're talk
S0439	yeah i'm definitely one of those people that get halfway through a sentence and they're not really sure where it's go and then kind of just have a little break
S0432	yeah
S0439	i'm like damn it erm
S0432	yeah but i think it like we know we speak differently to how we write
S0439	yeah
S0432	but it's just kind of like see what the differences actually be
S0439	yeah and also the different situations
S0432	like can actually categorise it yeah
S0439	like this morning i be like over the weekend i be have a bite of an argument with a friend of mine and we have like a little chat this morning about it and in the way on the drive here i be try in my head to like formulate how i say what i want to say because i be like i don't actually know how to say what i want to say
S0432	yeah
S0439	to get like the mean across so like i think difficult situations i have to definitely think and like formulate and just plan what i'm go to say
S0432	yeah
S0439	whereas like normal chitchat i can waffle on about anything
S0432	yeah yeah that's true actually that's a good point
S0439	come our rubbish
S0432	i never think about that unless it's just a spontaneous argument then it's different and
S0439	oh yeah
S0432	you go back afterwards you're like i should have say that
S0439	yeah yeah damn it
S0432	but yeah if you know you're gonna like have a confrontation or something
S0439	yeah
S0432	you can plan it
S0439	i don't i'm not really like an argumentative person so i i don't think the only person i think i've ever have a proper shout match with be my mum
S0432	yeah
S0439	never have a proper shout match with anybody else
S0432	no i don't think i have well like my sisters or something
S0439	yeah
S0432	like nothing
S0439	like a part of me really want to you know like in film and you see like somebody throw a drink over somebody
S0432	yeah
S0439	i'd love to do that
S0432	i'd love to do that
S0439	i've never do it
S0432	and just like yeah just smash things up
S0439	yeah
S0432	your way through
S0439	i'm the person who's like oh god don't break up
S0432	yeah
S0432	when they do like that on the table
S0439	yeah
S0432	switch everything off you're like
S0439	that's
S0432	i'd love to do that but i wouldn't want to cos
S0439	no
S0432	everything's in order
S0439	and there's like the kenco i think it's kenco or some coffee advert when they're like in the kitchen they're like go for it and
S0432	yeah
S0439	they just knock it off the table and the coffee go everywhere and they're like the coffee and i'd be like that's me
S0432	yeah
S0439	i'd be the one like clean all the coffee
S0432	like break my best mug or something
S0439	yeah damn it
S0432	like shouldn't have do it
S0439	no i wouldn't say i'm ocd but i do like things to be in order
S0432	yeah oh yeah i'm definitely like that
S0439	kind of contradict yourself really doesn't it
S0432	yeah
S0439	i think everyone have their ocd moments
S0432	yeah
S0439	like mine be i have to have match peg when i hang out wash
S0432	oh do you

S0439	one of the girls in my team her desk be immaculate and every night she leave and everything's in its right place i'm just like how do you do this like
S0439	i've try to model my desk on her desk and it's just fail
S0432	oh no
S0439	it's just not look the same i dunno how she do it but my housemate be also call and her bedroom be so clutter like it's really small and clutter but everything be in the right place if that make sense
S0432	mm yeah
S0439	like and all her dvds like
S0432	she know where everything be kind of
S0439	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0439	and it's just everything's just so well organise but just in a very small room i'm just like
S0432	yeah
S0439	how do you do this how do you make a room look so homely
S0432	mm
S0439	cos i'm the opposite i be very like minimal
S0432	mm
S0439	like i hate clutter so
S0432	yeah
S0439	you walk into my room it's just like white wall
S0432	yeah
S0439	and now there's just picture everywhere
S0432	yeah i don't mind a lot of stuff as long as it be like neat and tidy or like
S0439	yeah
S0432	hide or
S0439	mm
S0432	i'm not like though where i have like a you know the like rubbish cupboard where it's just like chuck in
S0439	yeah no no i don't think i don't have that i don't have enough stuff to do that to be honest i just
S0432	no i don't
S0439	just the yeah but like i wouldn't even say like my wardrobe be particularly very full i just don't like
S0432	mm
S0439	stuff i'm one of those people that either really love something or really or like if i'm shop and i see a dress that i love i kind of have to get it
S0432	yeah
S0439	if not i won't be satisfy
S0432	yeah
S0439	but if i'm try look at i'm like mm i kind of like it mm i won't i just can't buy it like
S0432	oh really
S0439	i have to really like it
S0432	yeah
S0439	same as like anything like cake clothe shoe men
S0432	yeah
S0439	like i really like them or just like no
S0439	no
S0432	just get rid of it
S0439	yeah i'm really bad like that
S0439	just like apathetic about anything i don't really really like
S0439	but
S0432	that's fine though cos as least then you're like surround by everything that you like
S0439	yeah
S0432	you're not like oh i shouldn't have get that or
S0439	i don't and spend like my housemate she'll go to primark and she'll just spend like fifty pound
S0432	oh no
S0439	and get load of crap and she'll be like well i kind of like it but you know
S0432	yeah
S0439	they be only five pound so i buy it i be like that's five pound you could spend on something else
S0432	yeah yeah
S0439	it's like you could put it together and buy a really nice pair of shoe
S0432	yeah and i'll only buy something if i know it'll like go with something else that i've already get
S0439	yeah mm
S0432	or something cos otherwise i know i'll just never wear it
S0439	yeah yeah
S0432	cos there's nothing
S0439	yeah
S0432	and i'll probably wouldn't buy anything to go with it for a while so it'd just be pointless
S0439	yeah yeah pretty much although the only thing that that doesn't for me doesn't actually shoe i love shoe i love heel
S0432	do you
S0439	like kurt geiger heel rock my world
S0432	oh
S0439	so i just see a pair and i'll buy them and i actually i've get like six or seven box under my bed and i genuinely don't wear them i just
S0432	oh really
S0439	have them and they don't like one pair doesn't even go with anything i own but i just want them
S0432	mm
S0439	and they be on sale
S0432	yeah they might eventually
S0439	one day they will
S0432	yeah
S0439	one day i wear them with an outfit that didn't even match just because i really want to wear them
S0439	i be like i have to wear these shoe
S0432	well i take my i've get a twin and
S0439	mm
S0432	she's like that she will just she's get she's get so many pair of shoe it's ridiculous and like when she move out she kind of go through them all and
S0439	yeah
S0432	like take some out and i look at the ones she be chuck out and i be like half of them be like the same
S0439	yeah

S0432	oh
S0439	and like they do they didn't last very long
S0432	oh no
