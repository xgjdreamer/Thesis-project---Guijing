S0548	we think so
S0547	i'm i'm surprise if they do
S0548	i know i be we think they be but we're not sure so we need to sort that out but then of course grandma's get this eat thing hasn't she i don't know what she eat actually
S0547	what do you mean
S0548	well she can only eat certain things
S0549	she didn't finish it when she come up to see me to have a meal but i'm sure she have she have chip i think or mash
S0548	so i don't know
S0549	what do she say when you ask her
S0548	well i'll eat anything you know me i'll just pick at whatever's there
S0547	well this be all news to me
S0549	well it be to me when i sit down at the meal with them apparently she's get some dietary requirements now cos she's not gluten free but
S0548	mm
S0547	just for a bite of fun make people
S0549	something no there's something wrong with her
S0547	just make it awkward for everyone oh so it's not a lifestyle choice
S0548	no
S0549	she have to eat very bland plain bore foods and she can't have anything fizzy
S0550	it's like an bowel bowel thing or something isn't it
S0548	yeah but it's a bite more than that
S0547	so gluten free so there's no
S0549	mm
S0549	i don't know if it be gluten free
S0547	how be she then
S0548	i don't know i don't think it's gluten free cos if it be gluten free i'd have to buy gluten free bread and she's not ask me to
S0547	and you're not go to either
S0549	i don't think it be gluten free it's something so be we do anything with them be we just hang around the house and
S0550	we'll just tie them up and put them in the garage
S0548	it depend what time they get here we dunno what time they're come
S0549	can you imagine in years to come if we say that about you two
