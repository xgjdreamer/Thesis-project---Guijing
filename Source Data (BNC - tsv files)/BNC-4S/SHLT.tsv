S0144	i don't know
S0012	when will you when
S0024	they have their own set why would they have somebody else's
S0012	they can't all have their own set because they it's it's the television that own the stuff
S0013	i suppose they do yeah
S0012	and they come along stick a mic down your front and up your trouser leg or wherever and then stick these things in your lug
S0024	yeah they would have to sterilise them
S0144	would they but you can't sterilise electronics
S0024	well they just they're throw away
S0144	well you just give them a wipe wont they maybe just give them a wipe with a one of those cloths
S0012	yeah yeah spray them with that no they can't spray them can they
S0144	no i never think of that really
S0024	well when you work at any place even if you're if you what's it call when you hot desks
S0144	hot desk
S0024	hot desking in an office if you're hot desking in an office then you just take all of your equipment in your home with you
S0013	mm
S0024	and you have your ear plug and you plug in wherever you go
S0012	well in an office they reckon there's more more germs and disease on a keyboard than on a loo of the seat
S0012	seat loo rather seat of a loo
S0144	yeah that's probably true actually i mean the toilets get clean what three time a day in an office
S0012	yeah
S0144	keyboards never get touch
S0012	they never get touch
S0144	and they've get bits of food in them like grow mould and
S0012	that's right and and they sneeze on them and
S0144	yeah you get sneeze people's hand
S0012	and they don't go to the wash their hand when they go to the loo
S0144	yeah they must be pretty dirty
S0024	mm
S0012	and they they just they have a thing on there they have they have a programme on the television where they do this special wipe and they breed the stuff whatever it be in one of these little gelatine things
S0144	urgh yeah yeah
S0012	in proper condition and the loo seat be the cleanest and the keyboard be it it the growth be all over it and they tell you all about the growths what they be botchalism
S0012	yeah and and you know the and salmonella
S0144	what be that programme
S0024	you never think about that actually even people have get a cold in the office i cos we have to hot desk so we jump on different computers whenever they're free
S0144	well there's no point be there it's good to be expose
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0144	it be good though isn't it it toughen you up
S0024	mm
S0012	well that's half the problem isn't it that's half the problem with all the diseases today
S0024	yeah we sterilise things too much
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0024	i mean you you two have both have different colds over the winter tom and i didn't get them
S0012	no
S0013	no

S0012	yeah they be long last yeah
S0144	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	but we haven't have colds for yonks and that's the truth i i think two thousand the year two thousand be the last time we be both very ill together weren't it the millennium
S0013	mm
S0012	we be go to sit up and watch the millennium and i have to sleep in one room chris have to sleep in another she be boil hot i be freeze cold
S0024	that be flu wasn't it
S0012	that be flu and that be the last time
S0144	it's the millennium bug
S0012	yeah
S0012	yeah the millennium yeah yeah it's when all them plan crash isn't it
S0144	what be that programme that we use to watch and those two american guy and they use to test a theory
S0024	yeah
S0144	can't remember what it be call
S0024	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0012	bang go the theory
S0024	mythbuster
S0144	no mythbusters
S0012	oh yes i've see mythbusters yeah
S0024	they do one where i don't the myth be there's poo everywhere or something
S0012	mm
S0024	what
S0144	and so they they go in the bathroom and they test for like faecal matter on everything
S0024	oh they clean their teeth
S0012	yeah
S0144	and apparently they they from the toothbrushes the the bristle on the toothbrush all have trace of of poo on them
S0024	cos they be say their toothbrush
S0012	what
S0024	no
S0144	yeah because when you flush the loo like small particles
S0012	oh yes yeah
S0144	well it all come up and drop
S0024	no yet but the toothbrush nearest to the toilet have less bacteria on it than the toothbrush they take outside of the bathroom and put in a cupboard that have just as much
S0144	do it
S0012	yeah yeah
S0144	don't remember that
S0013	mm
S0012	you see i've always
S0144	cos you keep your toothbrush in the bathroom
S0013	that that's a myth isn't it that one
S0144	no
S0024	no they test how much bacteria like over how much you would collect over a time with your toothbrush be in the bathroom next to the toilet
S0012	no
S0013	mm mm
S0024	well you know on the sink or your toothbrush be outside somewhere and your toothbrush be in all these different place
S0144	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	that's really strange cos you go to the loo in say morrisons
S0024	just in the air isn't it
S0012	they're very they're beautiful loos very clean loos in morrisons in fact they're the best loos we've be in aren't they
S0013	probably yeah
S0012	but you go to the loo and you go and use this here thing to wash your hand people come in and out they grab hold of the door they haven't wash their hand or anything
S0144	yeah i hate it it's the doors isn't it that's the yeah
S0012	it's the doors yeah so i always have a piece of tissue
S0024	mm i do that quite a lot as well
S0012	and open the door with a piece of tissue or open up with your shoulder or elbow yeah
S0144	i try and open it with my elbow usually yeah
S0024	but i forget when you go in when you go in you think it's alright and then you lock the door without the tissue
S0012	that's right yeah
S0024	and then you get outside of the toilet and there's no soap or something
S0012	yeah
S0024	and then you're like mm what do you do
S0012	yeah it's awful isn't it yeah but i mean there be loos that we've be to we and you're absolutely bust but you think i'm not use that
