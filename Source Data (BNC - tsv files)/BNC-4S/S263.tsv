S0588	no that be just not sarcasm that be just i don't think it be sarcasm
S0589	bite sarcastic
S0588	oh be it okay

S0588	what the hell be those
S0588	oh
S0590	sorry
S0590	oh oh the wrong one
S0589	i have to to make this come through
S0588	this time i do the back flush i'm not see a lot of difference between the two
S0589	i do the back flush
S0588	the one at the the back i'm sorry i'm not get this
S0589	well here's the mnemonic
S0588	the one next to the wall
S0590	be the same
S0588	be for wee
S0589	but the way to remember it be the rhyme the one near the wall
S0588	be for wee
S0589	be for small
S0588	oh the one near the wall be for small
S0590	and
S0590	by the one near the wall it's just it's the same depression but
S0588	but that look like the bigger one cos that's the one that's stick out in a concave fashion not convex
S0590	no the the
S0588	the one next to the wall be go
S0590	no no
S0588	no it be
S0590	no it isn't
S0588	no hold on let me look again it be the one near the wall
S0590	no
S0590	wait a minute stay up there stay up there
S0616	the one near the wall be small
S0588	look it's convex look
S0590	yeah but if you think of that as
S0588	no that's bigger
S0590	no no if you think of circular
S0616	i didn't mean to install it to cause
S0616	a family rift i'll take it away
S0616	i'll take the flush away and you'll have to do a bucket
S0590	so all of this
S0588	yeah well to me that
S0590	no but think of the diameter
S0588	no okay
S0590	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0590	so so it's the top one
S0588	yeah
S0590	and actually it look smaller
S0588	alright well that's my strange
S0590	yeah
S0588	autistic brain
S0590	yeah
S0588	then
S0590	well
S0588	but it's to me that look like the bigger one
S0590	if you look at it yeah but
S0590	can you see can you see that it's
S0588	er there's more space
S0590	yeah
S0588	in here yeah
S0590	yeah it's very very solid
S0588	oh it's lovely
S0590	yeah
S0590	so this little one be the half flush
S0588	that's the small one i'd still like an arrow
S0590	and this
S0588	well
S0588	and what be what be guests go to do cos i don't think that's exactly that clear
S0590	well i think
S0588	they'll just flush whichever and what happen if you flush both of them at the same time
S0590	well i don't think it matter
S0589	a super flush
S0588	be that a super flush
S0589	yeah
S0590	oh be it
S0588	i don't know there must be some instructions somewhere in fact
S0590	no i think you're just mean to work it out by uhu by trial and error
S0588	it doesn't say cos hasn't see the new toilet yet have he

S0588	i usually
S0616	right
S0590	yeah
S0588	find someone and then they move to italy or something
S0616	yeah no well that's it
S0588	it's really annoy
S0616	that's why i'm always surprise when i i always poke my nose in if i'm work at the i'll pop my nose in and go
S0588	yeah
S0616	where's the girl with the glass and
S0590	yeah
S0616	if she's there i go oh perfect
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	yeah
S0616	can you cut my hair but
S0590	yeah
S0616	any of the others cos i have try one of the others and
S0588	yeah they just
S0616	but it wasn't so good
S0588	don't understand
S0590	no no
S0616	no wasn't
S0588	there be only
S0616	just wasn't good
S0588	ever one hairdresser that understand how to do the back of my neck when i have a bob and when he leave no one could do the back of my neck
S0590	yeah
S0588	and it always look awful that's why i've get long hair now really but erm the only who know

S0588	and you just have a trim
S0616	unless they cut it badly and you think oh i'm gonna have to have it all cut off

S0616	well well no well it can
S0590	well at least if it's long you've get a you can make it a if it go wrong you can have it cut a little bite shorter
S0616	mm
S0590	to correct it whereas
S0616	mm
S0590	if it's short and it go wrong there's
S0588	yeah that's the most disastrous
S0590	not much leeway

S0590	mm
S0589	the bag of kindle i get from aldi last time actually turn out to just be cut up skirt board with still a lot of the piece still have the sort of price label sticky label when it be a
S0616	oh okay
S0589	piece of skirt board
S0616	it's all the offcuts and things
S0589	i guess ones that be too warp so they do have a some sort of quality control
S0590	mm
S0616	yeah
S0589	just get a machine in to
S0616	yeah
S0590	so you i mean you didn't buy the skirt board do you so how much skirt board
S0616	no you need
S0590	do you still need
S0616	yeah you need to
S0589	i need about that much
S0616	well you need a full length for the under that window don't you
S0589	yeah that's about that big isn't it
S0616	well no
S0590	bite long yeah
S0616	you'll have to put a tape on it
S0589	no it's about that much
S0616	bite small i think he
S0590	he be his father's son you see in certain elements still
S0616	right okay remind he need to go to the shed and find the skirt board
S0590	board sample
S0616	so that you can take it
S0590	yes
S0616	to the shop and and measure it but i would say it's well at a guess it's this but i i'd say you want like probably a two metre length
S0589	no no cos it's only the length underneath the window that i need
S0616	yeah
S0590	well
S0616	but it's over a metre
S0590	it it's no it's actually it's that length less the door

S0616	you can use the rest for kindle purpose
S0590	yeah yeah
S0589	that's all i'd buy one single length and it's all

S0616	mm
S0590	they'd be quite good for privacy there actually yeah
S0589	privacy
S0616	mm
S0589	until the
S0616	i think
S0589	the privet hedge grow
S0616	certainly erm you notice a difference with the heat
S0589	well otherwise i'd just like these windows replace but with real windows
S0616	yeah yeah
S0589	like for like
S0588	hello
S0589	ah look at him look up
S0616	proper sort of double glaze
S0590	yeah double glaze winter actually
S0589	wouldn't even necessarily have to be double glaze i mean i i think
S0590	oh they would have to be double glaze
S0616	you should yeah no
S0589	well just
S0590	for oh for heat conservation
S0589	just the sash window
S0616	well you can get
S0589	oh no no darling
S0616	replacement wood double glaze sash windows you can
S0589	yeah i have
S0589	someone here to give me a quote
S0616	yeah in wood
S0589	yeah
S0616	mm
S0590	and what be for the snug that be and how much be it for the snug
S0589	i can't remember now it's about three or four hundred pound per window
S0616	mm
S0589	they don't the size doesn't matter
S0590	mind you if it be only three or four hundred that's not bad actually for a whole window
S0616	mm
S0590	they're very big windows
S0616	mm i dunno it's a it's well it's a that's another minefield window company
S0590	yeah
S0616	you know they just they just pluck a figure out out out of the air
S0589	oh he's get salt on his nose
S0590	yeah
S0588	ah
S0590	yes yes
S0588	you won't like that
S0590	that's we're lucky down in you know deepest in that the the
S0616	mm
S0588	mm look gonna open that up
S0588	yeah bite raw over his eye usual place
S0590	you know the people that we've use you know we know and they live there
S0616	mm
S0590	so you know they can't get away with a real sort of rogue job at all
S0616	mm
S0590	you know so
S0616	mm
S0590	and most of them work by word of mouth and reputation so
S0616	exactly yeah
S0590	so you know their their reputation be be er
S0616	mm
S0590	er very valuable for them so they don't want to do badly
S0589	must get window cleaners as well on the basis that we've never have
S0588	mm so do
S0589	they won't reach the top but they could at least do the this
S0588	well i think they would they're window cleaners
S0589	no i've ask before and they can't reach the top
S0590	i mean they'd be
S0616	er what
S0590	pretty lucky
S0588	oh
S0590	to be able to get up to here
S0616	no
S0589	they can get up to here i reckon without any issue but er not not the top floor
S0616	well you've be do do they open upstairs
S0589	it's a little difficult
S0589	it's not necessarily the case that erm they open fully both ways so
S0588	mm
S0589	you know cos i've try do it on the inside
S0616	mm
S0589	and then it almost look worse if there's a little stretch you can't get so you've get clean and then a revolt stripe
S0616	right
S0590	yes yeah then you're really aware of it
S0589	then you're suddenly
S0590	yes yeah
S0589	that they be
S0590	yeah whereas if they're just dirty
S0589	truly if they're just dirty
S0590	you actually in a way don't notice like
S0616	mm
S0590	glass actually
S0616	mm
S0589	yeah
