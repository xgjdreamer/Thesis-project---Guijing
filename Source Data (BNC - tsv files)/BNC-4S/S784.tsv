S0405	really
S0554	yeah
S0405	wow do any of you guy know
S0402	cos always talk about him
S0405	oh really
S0402	do you know
S0554	i've hear that yes
S0402	be my favourite youtuber but he he he produce content like ten years ago now he's stop and he's the he's the president of motion picture at buzzfeed
S0555	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0402	people hate him for that because he's the ultimate viral guy
S0555	no no but yeah but he's he
S0402	he make good cat videos that's the only thing
S0555	he he no but he's make buzzfeed so successful
S0402	i need a piss
S0405	er yeah i know
S0555	on youtube
S0405	it's ridiculous the amount of viral content they have and like
S0555	yeah
S0405	like er er like he do erm talk on how they get viral content and it's interest like but it's just the worst content so basically they appeal erm to some kind of social group that's their primary basis
S0555	yeah
S0405	so they appeal to chinese people or they appeal to homosexuals as in gays or or trans or they appeal to mexicans and then they say these people do this and they try and find an area where they can relate and it's just it it work so well
S0555	yeah yeah the thing be i part of it be like because there's so little representation for any form form of minority group in media
S0405	yeah i know so
S0555	and that be like the one outlet that they have
S0405	i suppose yeah that be a good thing but
S0554	oh it's come to play card
S0405	no can we not i wanna play card but
S0555	can you just make that noise again
S0405	you've get it forever it's record okay
S0402	we're on screen splash put it back
S0555	i do want to play card
S0405	be you serious like i always wanna play card but we can't submit if we if we play card
S0555	no we'll continue talk
S0402	we can continue talk with our card
S0405	yeah yeah yeah no we always try that though it never work
S0555	it's just gonna be it's gonna be like we're talk about something really like triple threes
S0554	wait can they just
S0405	yeah yeah yeah that's not good they don't want that
S0555	so can i ask about
S0405	yes
S0555	do you think that there's actually a difference between men and women
S0405	erm i believe in something call the gender similarity hypothesis
S0555	okay
S0405	which believe that well work it out but most of the differences gonna have a look at this so
S0555	have there
S0405	so we're talk about i believe in something call the gender er similarities hypothesis which mean er i i believe
S0555	can i can i just ask my let me start with my question
S0405	yeah yeah yes
S0555	like i i be just i just ask i just ask erm erm and and and you as well
S0402	everyone yeah
S0555	yeah just all of you all the audience
S0554	all of our listeners our listeners guy
S0555	but like erm erm fuck my question my question be do you think there's do you think there's a genuine difference between men and woman be as in be be in a like physiological or like mental genetic
S0405	like behaviour
S0555	not like genetic not that there be
S0405	like natural natural behaviour
S0402	erm i think i think i if you take a kid from birth and you put him on mar him on mar and a girl on mar they would grow up and you put them together and they grow up together alone from any of outside influence they'd grow up effectively the same they'd be effectively similar gender roles be a a society thing
S0555	socially construct
S0402	socially
S0405	yeah that's that's that's similar to what i believe definitely there's the
S0555	sorry what's it call
S0405	er gender similarities hypothesis so just definitely society exaggerate the differences you know men be from er mar women be from venus erm yes er
S0402	's from jupiter
S0554	why jupiter
S0402	i don't know
S0554	pluto he's like from pluto
S0405	yeah he's from pluto
S0402	he he's from the comet
S0554	and he get really piss off that they're a dwarf planet now but
S0555	oh no
S0405	and yeah culture be obviously have a huge impact on it
S0555	yeah
S0405	and but that's not to say that culture isn't real the fact that culture have an impact on people erm sort of make it real as in we have a society that perpetuate gender differences so therefore these differences become prevalent in our society so
S0555	yeah it's like it's like the identification that you have as a result of the culture you've be expose to be real
S0405	make it real exactly erm yeah
S0554	what be you gonna say about it
S0402	yeah i know i i don't yeah but that yeah it's real because it happen but i don't think it's real because it be there
S0405	yeah yeah i know it's not
S0402	cos if you have a small group of people right say at the start of humanity there be like hundreds of people
S0405	yeah
S0555	yeah
S0402	if if one person coin something first before everyone else can tell someone that and there's no one else to argue against it and that become history throughout years and years
S0405	yeah
S0402	no one will argue against it ever because it's be there for so long
S0405	yeah i see the point you're make
S0555	i know i know i i i mean as in like it's it's a reality to be accept not as in it's actually true so
S0405	yeah oh no yeah yeah erm and and the things that you see every day often perpetuate it so
S0555	yeah
S0405	so erm you you you think about why people be so scar of plan
S0402	right
S0405	erm you only ever hear about plan that
S0555	crash
S0554	that crash
S0405	whereas if if the headline be true you'd obviously hear you know three thousand plan take off and land successfully a day but we only hear oh this this plane take off erm and and and you know crash or whatever so
S0402	but i mean the fact of the matter be that you're more likely to die in a car crash
S0405	exactly and and people don't get that erm
S0554	be it like similar to the terrorist attack you're more likely to die from the nhs
S0555	like get hit on
S0405	yeah or it's like shark or there's so many ridiculous things erm
S0402	it's that's kind of the reason why i'm not scar of isis
S0405	yeah
S0402	because i can go to and the probability of the of them kill me at
S0555	but also there's
S0554	yeah protect us all
S0555	yeah i'm not scar
S0405	what be that
S0554	you haven't see it be this person on facebook who just i don't know why she be so angry
S0555	oh sorry
S0554	she be so angry she just put up a post say i will destroy isis
S0555	yeah
S0402	no way
S0555	since that day a fake page have be put up to like
S0402	it's on the nine
S0555	why be that
S0405	what be you do
S0402	wait i put a nine there though
S0555	so what be you do
S0402	i put a nine down
S0555	oh
S0402	where do the jack come from be that mine or it that yours
S0554	that's yours that's yours
S0405	i didn't have a second jack
S0402	wait do you put one maybe maybe i put no maybe
S0402	okay
S0554	but yeah erm
S0402	okay let me take this back i'll put a nine down
S0554	but yeah erm
S0402	do i or you put the nine down you put the nine down
S0405	in term of physical differences erm most people obviously exaggerate it because of they think the hormones be different we have the same hormones erm they're just in different amount and
S0554	yeah and we have different sensitivities to them
S0405	exactly and we there've be test erm do
S0402	do
S0405	after okay oh right erm of of particularly after birth of er er er look after a child
S0555	mm
S0405	erm and men and women basically have the same responses in term of the hormones that get release in term of attachment to the child
S0555	mm
S0405	yet almost everyone would assume that women be instinctively more draw to look after a child but
S0555	yeah
S0405	there's i mean i don't i'm not say that's completely false but it's definitely not completely true and it's definitely more complicate so
S0555	yeah
S0405	erm do you know who i i have the biggest debate about this with she's a she's a behavioural psychologist
S0555	yeah
S0405	and i'm a human scientist
S0555	yeah
S0405	and we just have completely conflict like it
S0555	why
S0405	cos she believe that er what be the basis of the argument her the topic that we be discuss be sexual promiscuity in teenagers
S0555	yeah
S0405	and she be argue that erm people get attach to people if they have sex erm i can't play
S0402	again
S0405	erm people er get he she her argument be you shouldn't have sex at an early age
S0402	right
S0405	for a couple of reason well for many different reason erm for erm one because if you experience it
S0405	it's really hard i can't think and do the
S0402	okay that be so
S0405	i'm so struggle
S0402	we shouldn't play card while we're do this
S0405	okay erm
S0554	we're still go to play it
S0555	you guy just need to get use to it
S0554	yeah yeah erm
S0405	okay erm so
S0554	if you think about make podcast for a live
S0402	no it's double
S0554	we need to we need to like
S0405	er yeah okay erm
S0554	we're gonna play card
S0405	erm and erm so her argument be that
S0402	go back go back to the start cos i i didn't get any of that
S0554	just bring up a twitter message okay erm so
S0402	well we don't want to see your your dm please
S0554	no no no honestly apparently they'd just have
S0405	a scientific debate
S0554	that's all they talk about weren't weren't you try to convince
S0555	okay psychology er people shouldn't have sex when they're young
S0405	yeah er okay yeah yeah yeah it be it be chiefly about two people we know and she strongly disagree with it erm
S0402	why
S0405	because erm she believe that if you enjoy that at an early age one she believe that certain hormones be release that make you attach to them which i think be actually bullshit and
S0402	no i i think that's fair
S0405	i i i don't think it i i think those same bond of attachment erm
S0405	they're they they can just easily be break and it's not she be argue that it's er painful or
S0402	yeah i think so
S0405	or wrong it it it be painful but it's bad for the person in the long run
S0402	well i mean erm
S0405	erm to to do that erm i i'm not think right erm to it's wrong to erm break that whereas i think it's completely natural and
S0402	well when when you say when you say wrong you mean like wrong morally or
S0405	no no no not morally we shouldn't do that because it it it have a last impact
S0555	socially
S0402	okay
S0405	in a harmful way
S0402	we be no i i i think it do because why do why do so like in society everyone say first kiss first person you have sex with
S0405	mm yeah
S0402	who first
S0405	yeah exactly exactly
S0402	yeah
S0405	that's what society perpetuate whereas if you look at the the the actual biology behind pair bond it's natural for er humans to have either social
S0402	yeah
S0405	or sexual pair bond
S0402	yeah
S0405	either multiple throughout their life or multiple at the same time
S0402	right but
S0405	so generally in in erm if you study it anthro er anthropologically
S0402	yeah
S0405	then you have social pair bond
S0554	yeah
S0405	and you have er sexual pair bond
S0554	yeah
S0405	which some they can be the same you you can be both social and sexual with someone so i have three social pair bond with you guy i might have a sexual pair bond with someone else
S0405	but it be perfectly it be perfectly healthy for me to no no longer be friends with
S0555	it's gotta be
S0402	well no no no no no no let's not go there because it's like you're pretend to
S0405	okay it would be it would be
S0554	no no he's he's he's he's just demonstrate his theory he's not be friends with any more he's just be sexual
S0555	no
S0405	okay yeah oh sure
S0402	just sexual
S0555	yeah
S0405	it would be healthy for me to have a sexual relationship with someone and then break up with them whereas
S0402	yeah yeah no no but but that's the er problem with a a purely
S0402	again if you have like two people on mar that would be fine right but we don't that's not like the perfect world we live in
S0405	right so you're argue
S0402	because there be society and we live in that world
S0405	you think it do perpetuate
S0402	yeah
S0405	but society be change and and the the the attitude like fifty percent of people get divorce now it's more ridiculous that we try and perpetuate this idea when
S0555	of monogamy
S0405	yeah when when in reality i'm i'm not say we're all savage which be what people just assume i'm say but i do believe we're not naturally monogamous and i do believe that
S0555	you don't believe in actual monogamy
S0402	yeah i i think i agree with that
S0405	no no and and i but i don't most people then think the only other argument be that we're all savage i don't think that i think we can be commit to someone it's very hard but i think you can be
S0402	yeah i know but i think again commitment be a a a social thing rather than a a purely human psychological
S0405	uhu construct yeah it's not purely but i think there be biological motivations behind it
S0402	i mean i mean yeah i i i would say if you're gonna be erm mostly bond to anyone it's gonna be your children because you wanna rear them er just on a biological level it's er important to rear them until they can reproduce
S0405	yeah
S0555	yeah
S0402	rather than a sexual partner because unless they can you you're rely on them to provide
S0555	but if you look at there there
S0402	yeah
S0405	yeah
S0555	there's also like erm i i'm read this book on erm er genetics
S0405	mm hm
S0555	genetics and erm they be say that other other other primates like erm what be it chimpanzees have like
S0402	pan chimp er pan troglodytes they
S0555	they have like sex with just like load of they just have like
S0402	yeah
S0555	and and gorillas have harems so you have like a group of females and they just have sex with them
S0555	but humans like cos cos at a hunter gatherer stage it make more sense to have like a a specific unit between people like one person to go and forage and hunt another person to raise a child and maybe also forage as well
S0402	yeah yeah yeah
S0555	so we be also partially at least engrained with the idea that monogamy be be beneficial
S0402	yeah
S0405	mm hm
S0555	but also not cos of the fact that other primates do like just try and spread their seed as much as possible
S0402	yes yeah i envy er chimpanzees
S0555	most people yeah yeah
S0402	isn't that what do in the back of spanish
S0555	ah ah ah ah no
S0402	but i think the problem with try to look at it biologically compare to primates be that humans humans buck the trend massively
S0555	that's true
S0402	when when we become
S0554	mm
S0402	so life get so easy for us it be kind of like survive wasn't a problem any more so it wasn't our main life protectant
S0405	yeah
S0555	yeah
S0402	it be to like start move to like like i'm pretty sure primates wouldn't aren't as emotional like like you know if be a primate he wouldn't be so clingy to yeah but
S0555	yeah
S0405	but but the ideas of clinginess be quite substantially initiate by hormones like oxytocin and and so
S0402	no i'm just say that people run out of things people run out of things to do like two hundred years ago
S0405	right
S0554	so like people in africa who be still have that instinct to survive
S0405	yeah
S0554	what what do they how how be they look
S0405	in africa
S0554	some people in africa like the ones who be
S0555	do you mean people in poverty
S0405	do you mean like tribe
S0554	in poverty
S0405	oh okay
S0555	anyone in poverty
S0402	i i i think it's
S0402	different again because they they they can see the the the world
S0405	mm hm
S0402	the entire world as it be cos they're so connect it's not i mean you you look at from a like tribally i'm sure that that you know tribes people be more likely to be polygamous than monogamous
S0555	really
S0402	yeah
S0405	erm okay so then how about the idea that
S0555	i don't know
S0402	because we we have stuff like tv now right it it's not like we're gonna starve tomorrow or
S0405	no but like what do you mean by like tribe people be more polygamous can you give a specific
S0402	like like so so er no no i i mean do you know there's those there's place in like indonesia say where there's tribe that no one that the rest of humanity have never touch before they they're they're unaware of the world around
S0405	yeah okay yeah
S0554	yeah yeah yeah like there's this island near india
S0555	okay yeah
S0554	which no one have ever be to like andaman islands yeah
S0402	yeah
S0555	yeah the andaman islands
S0405	right yeah
S0402	and so so no one have ever be there no one have even
S0405	yeah
S0402	they don't have an understand of the the culture and society we build up
S0405	yeah
S0402	right so and and they don't have the technology or any of that
S0555	yeah
S0402	that we've use to like make our live so amazingly comfortable after over the last like three hundred years right
S0555	uhu yeah yeah
S0402	so they're still in that kind of hunter gatherer stage right
S0555	yeah
S0402	so their aim be to survive and rear their children
S0555	yeah yeah
S0402	where our aim no one go what be i do today i'm survive and i'm rear my children
S0555	yeah yeah
S0402	yeah what's what's your job i'm a survivor yeah no one say that
S0555	right yeah yeah
S0554	bear gryllis
S0402	bear gryllis
S0554	i'm a celebrity
S0402	yeah so so it's kinda like that's not a problem for us any more so we've have to find something else to do to fill our time with and that's when we develop stuff like emotions because we just have the time to
S0555	yeah mm i don't think we i don't think that's how
S0405	i disagree with that
S0555	it happen but i do i i think i kind of
S0402	i'm just say that's like the reason that we can't really accurately compare ourselves to primates because primates
S0555	i think the the reason that we can't be mostly because of the fact that when we develop we because of the fact that we're so successful we develop such large brain and now we're and now we be too complicate to compare to primates who who
S0402	yeah
S0554	yeah
S0555	who be much more simple
S0554	have you see rise of the planet of the ape
S0402	caesar
S0554	yeah
S0405	there be ways to look at primate anthropology in the right way and there be ways to do it the wrong way and most people do it the wrong way in that they get really defensive because if they all they just assume that people be just look at primates and just make these ridiculous connections the only reason we'd look at them be to look at an evolutionary history and try and identify trend as to why we develop certain either instinctive behaviours or er physiological erm or psychological motivations for why we do things
S0555	mm
S0405	but that doesn't always include the idea of nurture or the idea of our society the kind of effect that they have erm so you know it's just important to look at things in the right way the point you make about erm erm you say you think most sort of tribal culture would be polygamous
S0402	yeah yeah lot
S0405	how about well roughly right right yeah erm how about the idea so do you think erm so basically if you look at tribal culture the vast majority of them except this one tribe one single instance where it's the other way round most of those be polygamous in that it's of one male and multiple females
S0402	yeah
S0405	whereas this one tribe in tibet or former tibet that be multiple males and one female
S0402	mm right
S0405	so why do you think it be why do you think that do you think it it do you think our biology promote have that kind of polygamous culture or do you think it's just individual circumstances or do you think
S0555	well because women can like women's i think i feel like the idea that women be pregnant and they need to be care for by a man if there be multiple women then he need more protection to do something for all of them
S0402	yeah
S0405	yeah yeah right it's more practical right yeah
S0555	it's just easier
S0402	but isn't that just part of who the father be
S0554	isn't it just part of their culture
S0405	yeah
S0555	it could be yeah the father be yeah that's true
S0402	isn't it just part of their culture though
S0405	yeah that's the thing
S0554	something they've build up from
S0405	mm
S0555	no but they they can and like western and western and asian and like i don't know about amero indian culture but lineage be actually quite important as a social concept
S0402	mm hm yeah
S0555	there's a lot of myths around it erm
S0402	i think it's just i would say from a a kind of logistical stand point it's easier to have one man because like a woman's only gonna produce an egg every month
S0554	yeah yeah
S0405	whereas a man can basically produce sperm on point
S0555	for his whole life because women stop produce egg after like fifty or something
S0402	yeah yeah
S0405	yeah
S0402	yes
S0405	yeah erm as long as people don't then assume that that mean that erm it's natural for men to go around have sex with lot of different women and women will have the instinct to try and find one man that's no one's i'm paraphrase this argument
S0402	well no i i'm also sure that like cave men like just because one man would have sex with load of women
S0405	mm hm
S0402	i'm pretty sure there would be some where a woman might have sex with many men
S0405	right
S0402	i i think just because the tribes be then kind of branch off like that that that could possibly be because of an imbalance of men to women because if you have if you have many more women than men
S0405	right
S0402	obviously a man's gonna have sex with more women and a woman be gonna have sex with more different men
S0555	when you say cave man what do you mean by cave man
S0554	just mean erm ten thousand years ago
S0402	yeah
S0554	erm
S0402	like the most basic start of what we call humanity
S0555	do that mean like
S0405	we're likely we're likely to have evolve from our most previous ancestor about fifteen thousand years ago erm fifteen to forty thousand years ago to the species that we be now erm
S0402	communication
S0555	erm i saw a national geographic
S0405	yeah
S0555	print like two months ago they find a new er hominid
S0405	erm
S0555	no erm homoniphalis or something something like that yeah erm
S0402	in south africa
S0555	nipo nipo
S0554	homonipo homonipo
S0405	no no no genuinely it begin with an n it begin with an n that's it they find it in
S0402	well he be basically a primate
S0405	yeah
S0554	should we should we explain who be
S0405	no no no
S0555	never
S0402	no we can't we can't use the word i'm sorry
S0554	micro penis
S0402	micro penis
S0402	we can bleep these out later
S0554	yeah
S0405	but the thing they take from that be that it be basically deep into a cave into like really tiny crack
S0555	yeah it be an all female team who do it as well
S0405	yeah and and basically they conclude that this be some kind of
S0554	cos they're too cos men be too big to fit in
S0555	yeah yeah yeah that's why they have an all female team
S0405	they should have just get children in there
S0402	yeah they should have children
S0405	no the children might die
S0554	it's not just yeah
S0554	in the name of science
S0405	oh yeah
S0402	it's homonipo care
S0405	homonipo yeah
S0555	it's for science if they write it down it's okay
S0402	it be really weird they conclude that either it be some kind of someone be hide a body because they be there be these body in these tiny crack or what be more plausible be probably some kind funeral rite which be
S0555	yeah yeah they think it be which be really interest because it's because of how old it be so
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0555	so that be like the first instinct
S0402	or or maybe they all just feel down there
S0555	no no
S0554	that's another thing
S0555	it be impossible it be so intricate that it have to have be someone
S0554	yeah they do they do think that maybe like there maybe there be like more high water level so it be wash through
S0402	yeah
S0555	oh i see
S0554	but but it it they they think it isn't really cos there's no recent erm geological evidence for that
S0402	or anything
S0555	no
S0554	no there's no there's no there wasn't any geological evidence for it so they think maybe it be like a burial place
S0402	yeah yeah i know but i think scientists be always so quick to like attribute mean to anything that happen
S0554	yeah i know no but that's that's humans that's not scientists
S0402	yeah no but i'm say
S0555	that's the public
S0402	er if if you're a scientist it's your job to unearth the facts from what you see not get your emotions involve
S0405	i don't know no they be they be very initial initial find it's gonna be like plenty more
S0402	it's like if you see that you go oh my god it's funeral rites look how develop we be that's a problem
S0554	yeah no yeah no no that no that's the thing that's that's why people find it so odd because that we haven't previously think that that be possible and like people would in that with that stage of development in that species or in that time
S0555	mm hm
S0554	be develop enough to consider things like death and like erm recognise it and like
S0402	yeah art and
S0554	and like actually bury it cos that's too advance for them
S0402	yeah mm hm
S0554	but that's why it's so that's why people be think it's funeral think it think it's so controversial that it be
S0402	be they sure they didn't go oh 's dead let's just toss him in the crack
S0405	's dead
S0402	he he's start to stink a lot
S0405	no there be there be multiple body there be like five five or ten body go down so it wasn't just one guy
S0402	oh right oh right yeah the dead as well
S0555	yeah but even so they be so their brain be so small it would have be really weird if they do that
S0405	oh yeah
S0402	er er er smell smell bad toss in crack
S0405	what what do you say
S0402	toss in toss in toss in crack
S0405	oh toss him that's 's joke
S0402	toss him in crack
S0405	yeah ah yeah so do you think because i slightly because erm it's you sort of think it might be natural that one male would provide for many females just because of the physical nature do you think it be harder for males now put it into today's society do you think it's harder for males to be more monogamous or to be commit whereas for females it's easier because their biologically make that way this be the main debate so
S0402	i i feel like i feel like recently right so so you have like thousands of years of male domination right
S0405	yeah
S0402	and now like the last
S0554	male domination mean
S0402	like where where erm typically males have be see to to have all the job to have all the power where they be in charge of like absolutely everything and now because the roles be become more equal you have this like almost counter revolution where it's like there's a there's a lot of man hat i'd i'd say
S0555	ah
S0405	so when you say evolution do you think that's just cultural evolution or do you think
S0402	i i think this be cultural societal
S0405	do you think there's anything biological behind it
S0402	no i don't think there's anything biological about it
S0555	oh the man hat
S0402	yeah where where where
S0405	you just mean really angry feminists
S0402	yeah basically a a lot of really like like
S0405	right
S0402	where where feminism should have be about equality it's now about that everything a man do be wrong because because cos men for a thousand years be do wrong stuff
S0405	just step over yeah right but they're just people just assume all feminists be like that it's not the truth like
S0555	i don't i i don't i don't when people say that about feminists i it's that's not true
S0405	it's a bite strange yeah i know i know
S0402	yeah but there be there be a a strong proportion or at least the loud ones
S0405	a strong
S0555	no but the thing be that people say the same thing
S0405	but there's not
S0555	about islam they say the same thing about that
S0405	yeah
S0555	they're like oh those be the those be the loud ones those be the people do things that hear about that's the reason you hear about them
S0405	they only get report
S0555	you hear about them those it's like the same the same thing with aeroplanes you only hear about faulty aeroplanes aeroplanes that crash you only hear about like feminists that piss people off same with that
S0405	yeah this be thing he only ever re tweet the most extreme stuff about feminists or trans or
S0402	can we use name
S0405	yes name's boy
S0402	can we call him like er
S0555	we can't use name of people we're talk shit about
S0402	yeah that's right
S0405	they're not gonna hear this
S0554	okay how many 's be there in the world
S0402	there must be a lot
S0554	yeah
S0555	i mean i go to his birthday remember
S0402	but can't hear this now
S0555	oh no ah would lose it would have lose it just there ah man but er but yeah and do you hear about er there be a university in american and erm there be a lady who for about ten years have be give free yoga sessions to students really awesome
S0402	yeah yeah
S0554	be this again
S0555	yeah it's
S0405	right
S0555	and then erm
S0402	we should make a podcast about
S0405	right and so then the university get involve after a complaint have be put in
S0402	oh my god so annoy
S0405	and she be ban from do it because they make the case that yoga be steal culture
S0554	yeah
S0405	from certain culture from probably buddhist or indian culture or
S0402	wasn't it also cos like disable people be angry that they they couldn't do yoga or something they also make that point as well
S0405	it be from no yeah no it be from like the disable union or something but the point they be make that it be steal culture from from culture that do yoga and and it be about white oppression and for so many years we've steal
S0555	yeah yeah
S0554	white oppression
S0554	white white
S0555	white oppression
S0554	white supremacy
S0405	white supremacy even that that we've be steal these culture for so long it be it be ridiculous it be
S0554	obviously
S0555	i i the thing be like that that example be a bite weird can be a bite extreme but there be things like like in music festivals white people like to wear bindis and stuff
S0405	right
S0555	and the thing be like some people don't like it because a lot cos when people when when like a lot of people be younger
S0402	yeah
S0555	they be like mock or even now even nowadays they're mock or like stuff for wear bindis by other people and now they think as soon as they as soon as it become something beneficial for them like
S0554	right
S0555	they can use it as a fashion accessory they think it's okay they no no longer do it and they reduce it of it's any any religious value cos some things like that be religious and like yoga be originally a religious thing
S0402	yeah
S0554	have you be to like have you ever be to like any festivals the amount of like white people
S0405	i've be to one music concert
S0554	white people like girls and boys just wear really indian stuff that they have no idea the mean of
S0555	yeah
S0405	right
S0554	and that just take away all value
S0555	yeah it yeah exactly
S0554	like as an indian be at those festivals i just felt like it's almost disrespect
S0405	right
S0554	what my culture be and my family and my religion's about
S0555	exactly like i i i i do understand why it's kind of weird
S0554	uhu
S0555	because the thing be something like yoga have be so divorce with actual with what yoga be what yoga be originally
S0405	right yeah
S0555	that the only thing it have in common be the name that's the only thing cos yoga's originally a religious practice
S0402	mm hm
S0555	and it's like it's like
S0402	but isn't it then its own thing so it doesn't matter because it it's become so devolve that it's
S0555	no yeah no that's that's the thing that's why i think yoga's a bite weird but something like a bindi people don't wear bindis for decoration that's why people in pakistan generally don't wear bindis
S0402	mm
S0555	cos even though it's a cultural thing for that part of the world
S0402	mm hm
S0555	people because most people be most muslims don't wear it because they see it as a hindu thing because it's actually religious
S0405	right do do most of these do most of these people that wear bindis er er put bindis on be they do it to mock them or
S0555	no it's
S0554	they they think it's they think it look cool and it do look cool
S0405	yeah so what what's the problem with that
S0555	the thing be the thing be that you're reduce something to an accessory
S0405	okay right
S0555	it's like it's like if i get a picture of like i don't know it's like if i if i saw someone pray a muslim prayer and i think that's a cool dance move
S0555	and i start do that or if i like
S0555	or if like erm get like a sample from the quran and i put it in my song call weed weed weed or something
S0405	right yeah yeah yeah
S0555	like it's it's so divorce from actual context that it become disrespectful that's why people don't like it but i also understand like people think that's a bite weird
S0402	yeah
S0555	because sometimes things i don't know you can't you can't police everything and some things don't need to be police
S0402	i think i like that kind of
S0555	cultural syncretism
S0402	yeah but i you know i don't really see a lot of indian culture other than like you know people take the piss out of call centre
S0555	yeah
S0555	but they're that's what it be they take they they they make fun of what shit that they don't like and then they and then anything else that they want they just take
S0402	yeah i know but that's that's like everything though in life you know people don't eat broccoli because they don't like it but that doesn't mean that they like they're not go to eat the meat as well unless they're
S0405	what
S0554	it's an analogy
S0405	i don't like his analogies in general but this be particularly bad
S0402	wait if you if you if you if you have a plate of food right yeah and you have like chicken yeah
S0405	can you explain your point and not use an analogy
S0402	no i can't do that cos the word don't make sense in my head
S0405	okay alright okay okay okay
S0402	right so you have a plate of food right with like chicken and vegetables on it you don't like the vegetables you're still go to eat in chicken though cos everyone like chicken
S0555	what
S0405	and and how do that relate
S0402	because you're like say you you take the best stuff from it and and you leave the the stuff you don't like
S0555	yeah no but the but the people but the thing be you're take good stuff but the people there be still people who still practice the things that you think be less favour
S0402	yeah but that's like anything in life
S0555	and you're take the stuff which you like
S0402	that's stuff like everyone in life people will like and hate it everyone doesn't go i love you know everyone go yeah that's amaze we can all agree that we like this it doesn't work like that
S0555	also people mind that i'm just say why people believe it i don't necessarily believe it
S0405	what do you what do you do you do do you agree with most of what you've be say
S0555	i don't know actually
S0405	i say that like completely natural do you do you er do you do you do you er do you
S0555	do you do you do you i i don't know cos the thing be like
S0405	yeah yeah it's complicate
S0555	i'm i'm i'm my what be there for what be there in my culture for them to take so i have no personal experience of it
S0405	right
S0555	so i don't know if i have personal experience i can speak on i can speak on it but i can't so i don't have anything
S0405	do you think it's up to the dignity of the culture that be be take from
S0555	i i don't think like if if you're like discuss it you should be if there's a discussion about it you should only include people who have actually have who be from those culture where people thing things be be take
S0405	you should do that or should not do that
S0555	you should only have those people
S0405	oh okay
S0555	cos if you have like it's like it's like when they have like discussions about islam and they invite no muslim speakers
S0555	that's dumb like don't do that include people of the group that you're only
S0402	also it's important to have a range of speakers cos you're always on that show when they do invite a muslim they find they find the most hard line
S0555	yeah well
S0402	like right wing muslim
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0555	anjun chowdrey
S0405	yeah anjun
S0402	yeah and they they they get no they they don't get no no leave wing to balance it out or no one in the centre
S0405	yeah
S0402	it's always let's get the the most racist person we can find and then stick them on the show
S0405	yeah do you see the thing at brunel university with katie hopkins
S0402	oh yeah do they all just walk out
S0554	they all just like
S0405	yeah they stand up turn their back for like a minute
S0554	they they all
S0405	then they be like
S0402	fuck hate katie hopkins
S0555	yeah
S0405	it's such a student thing to do but i like it's a dick thing to do but
S0402	i like that they do it though
S0405	i don't i be like so happy with the the whole
S0554	yeah
S0555	after after martin luther king that's my top protest of all time
S0402	martin luther king
S0555	i mean they make no sense but
S0405	oh it be oh it be top top quality quality
S0402	why do people still listen to hopkins
S0554	they don't cos they stand up and leave though
S0402	yeah people subscribe to her beliefs
S0554	so many
S0405	why do people read the sun why do people read the daily she's a columnist for the daily fuck mail how can someone like that be a columnist
S0554	yeah but everyone know the daily mail's shit
S0405	i know but people read it and the sun have the second er er yeah the second wide er biggest readership in the uk
S0555	that's cos white people be racist and they don't like to say it
S0554	that's cos of page three and page three
S0405	they've stop page three now
S0402	they've stop page three
S0405	no no why
S0554	so why do people still read it
S0555	white people be racist
S0405	all white people ever
S0554	yeah how dare they
S0555	what's wrong with say white people be racist
S0405	what be it serious or not serious
S0555	yeah
S0554	well because white people
S0405	cos there's sixty million people and like forty million people of them be white
S0402	the last hour
S0555	no the thing be when i say white people
S0405	yeah
S0555	i don't mean i'm use it as a stand in for white supremacy but the thing be a lot of white people aren't very er er racism racism be systematic and white people generally
S0402	yeah actually yeah no that's a fair point because you're less likely to be racist if people have say racist things to you right
S0405	yeah
S0402	no one's ever say racist things to a white person
S0555	yeah
S0402	or it's very unlikely
S0554	yeah that's true
S0405	have you hear of reverse racism i know it might be a ball of shit thing
S0554	because because of white supremacy
S0555	no reverse racism be bull shit
S0405	okay okay but
S0402	not the ridiculous ones that be like
S0555	okay reverse racism be basically
S0402	you're gonna use the worst example
S0555	you can be racist no reverse racism be basically you can be racist to people who be in a position of power for example white people on a in a racial demographic white people
S0402	oh okay yeah but they're in power so there's nothing
S0555	yeah exactly so a reverse racist thing would be like if i say we're gonna have a discussion about something no white people include or if i say something like that
S0402	oh my god the white people would go mad if you say that
S0555	or if i or if i call a white person a cracker like
S0402	no no
S0555	cracker
S0402	okay obviously that that example's funny but then if you look at your
S0554	can we can call that one of our segment
S0555	yeah
S0402	but you're but you're exonerate these people just because they're in a position of power
S0555	no you didn't no you didn't let me finish explain
S0405	okay go on yeah
S0555	okay racism be a be a system and white people benefit from the system
S0402	yeah
S0405	you're right
S0555	no matter who they be they benefit from the system you
S0405	no that's generalise it okay yeah
S0555	no no no no no no let me let me finish let me finish speak
S0402	yeah cracker
S0402	yeah
S0555	for example
S0405	yeah
S0555	even if you have even if you don't if your family have never own for example slave or something
S0405	yeah
S0555	all white people have benefit from the slave trade due to the economic advantage gain by the british empire by the by americans because on the whole for example when when when erm erm like ah ah ah i can't remember but but
S0402	okay yeah yeah
S0555	i can't i can't argue very well on the spot but erm
S0402	no i hear you
S0555	but white people as a whole have benefit from structure like that
S0402	that's like that's like that's half a fair point because
S0555	i'm so i er i yeah it's half a fair point but go on yeah i'm not go to
S0555	but but also there's erm shit i i don't know what i'm say any more
S0405	go on go on think about it
S0555	erm
S0405	i'll i'll start and then you'll realise
S0555	but erm
S0554	wait can i make a point
S0405	yeah go on
S0554	when i go to india have you be to india so like when i go there every single advertisement on like a billboard be white people
S0555	right
S0405	yeah
S0554	all the advertisements on the tv be white people
S0402	it's like that poem we read
S0405	mm hm
S0402	do you remember the one for er for our gcse the one about the indian girl who say there be load of white people
S0554	electricity yeah
S0555	no just no oh erm
S0402	no something with the girl and he's get like a on her hand
S0555	yeah yeah
S0405	oh er a lone er er lose girl lonely girl erm
S0402	don't worry cambridge will help
S0405	yeah
S0555	er it be it be by or something i dunno
S0402	lucky yeah sorry why sorry go again though
S0405	but i think yeah
S0555	no but all all people all all basically almost all white people be implicit in the in the racial power structure because they like because because they don't
S0402	i see your point
S0555	because cos they be i don't know i
S0405	i disagree so i think
S0555	why
S0405	racism be wrong because it's racist not because
S0555	the thing be so many people don't say that they're racist and then power be
S0405	yeah i i totally agree racism towards black towards minorities in general be such a huge problem i no i i i i'm totally for that
S0555	yeah yeah
S0405	but to just completely dismiss it because
S0555	no but i'm not dismiss anyone
S0405	no but you're say the whole not a single white person can be you you say the whole of white people have benefit
S0555	no but no no no
S0405	from from the racism erm system
S0555	i guess yeah fine
S0405	and you can't put that on all white people
S0402	yeah no no er he's not say that they benefit because they they they outwardly do it and want to benefit
S0555	yeah
S0402	they're just say it it be what there there there be events that happen and without their knowledge or desire they benefit it from it anyway
S0555	yeah
S0554	right
S0405	that doesn't that doesn't mean that any that racism can't happen to these white people though yes there be generations that have benefit but
S0402	yes but but but it it doesn't make any sense for them because if you look at everywhere around the world especially like asia and africa the er and south america they idolise white people like white people like
S0405	again these be all examples there be go to be examples that be on the other way as well
S0555	not really
S0554	well there aren't
S0555	can you give me can you give me a genuine example of reverse racism
S0405	obviously i can't just quote something that's actually happen
S0555	yeah i know
S0405	but there must be white people that have be discriminate against
S0402	but that's a that's a not a a we're not i'm i'm
S0555	minority
S0405	no no no okay but the point be that you can't dismiss it because in general
S0555	no but the thing be like how would a white person be discriminate against what be that situation i can't even imagine
S0405	okay okay
S0555	i can't even imagine a situation where a white person be discriminate against for be white
S0405	so think of okay so say there be a black community wherever it be and there be a white person there and he's erm bully because he's the white kid or or bully and yes this thing these things have happen for thousands of years to black
S0405	not thousands
S0405	hundreds of years to black people and that's totally wrong but of course it can happen to the white person and like
S0555	but that's not that's not racism that's bully
S0405	no no yeah that's still racism though you can call someone racist
S0555	no it isn't
S0405	you can be racist you can hate that person because they're not black or they're not indian or they're not
S0555	you you can you
S0554	okay so
S0555	but that's bully but i don't think that's racism
S0405	so you only see racism in the culture in in the context of our in the historical context
S0554	no but what's the like ratio between a white person be bully for be white and a colour person be bully for be colour
S0405	but it's not yeah i'm say i i'm say the vast majority
S0402	you can't say colour any more
S0555	person of colour apparently
S0405	i'm say the vast majority happen to obviously happen to to
S0555	yeah person of colour
S0402	obviously we need this to go out we don't want to get take down for any race reason
S0405	no but
S0554	cambridge can you tell us which one's right
S0405	no but that's genuine it like they they would see this and they'd be like oh okay people be racist these days they're not go to take that out of it erm
S0402	we're not racist disclaimer
S0405	erm
S0555	yeah ah
S0405	racism in the form that you're say cannot occur but there be discrimination there can there can be the obviously the majority be against but but
S0554	in theory yes
S0405	but but discrimination
S0402	discrimination against anyone it doesn't happen
S0405	and i think you can call that that you can call that racism
S0402	yeah obviously it be possible i'm sure there's like
S0405	there have they have to be circumstances
S0402	there be there be a small amount a small amount of circumstances where it do happen we're just say the vast vast majority of the time a white the white culture be idolise to the point where everyone want to be in so if you wanna be it you have to
S0405	everyone there be seven billion people you can use something like the whole of the world
S0402	yeah no no
S0554	no no no
S0555	the thing be the thing be you're say that we can never make a generalisation so then why do we have doctor cos they can't cos doctor make generalisations all the time to treat their patients like we might as well
S0402	i have asthma when i be four
S0405	that's a completely different issue you're put you're say
S0555	no no but the thing be you're a concept you're use be that don't make generalisations
S0402	yeah
S0555	we're not buy it
S0405	okay i won't use the point you shouldn't use generalisations but i'll make the point you're say whole of white people to represent billions of people and that's all how about hundreds of millions of people and that's you can't do that
S0555	no but the thing be when i say white people it's short hand for people who be white people who be racist and the thing be a lot of white people be racist without say they're racist so the whole racist view be
S0405	no but you're say
S0555	without admit to be racist
S0402	wait what what
S0405	but you're say the whole of white people cannot cannot but
S0555	the whole of white people the whole of white people
S0405	yeah that's
S0402	or one of them
S0405	basically what you're say
S0405	cannot be subject to this kind of racism because
S0402	we're not we're say yeah obviously it's possible like in the way i could win the lottery tomorrow it's possible we're just say it's incredibly unlikely
S0555	but like no
S0405	it's not a probability thing
S0555	like how would a white person how would a white person be subject to racism
S0402	just because no i i'm say that it be possible i'm say it's possible i'm just say it's unbelievably unlikely because
S0555	yeah
S0402	there's no there's no reason
S0555	have you ever hear of like someone be deny a job because they be white
S0405	okay but
S0554	okay no no no but the way it work be the reason white people be in so much power be because most of the western worlds be white so a lot of the colour people that be subject to this like racism
S0405	mm hm
S0554	be immigrants that's why
S0555	it's it's not only that it's cos of erm colonialism
S0402	yeah i mean if you look at if you look at the part of the world that be the most develop they be the place with the greater proportion of caucasians
S0555	like you know your know your erm situation of the white person be bully
S0405	okay can you say yeah right
S0555	that would happen if white people move to say africa or asia or asia that doesn't happen
S0405	and there be okay no no okay yeah no but it do it it it would happen so
S0555	that wouldn't that wouldn't necessarily happen and that wouldn't necessarily
S0402	do a guy just get bully in sierra leone
S0405	okay okay can i make a point can i make a point okay
S0405	no matter what i say even if i use examples the reason that your point over supersede whatever i say be because you're say that it's such a small proportion
S0402	yeah
S0405	but of course it can happen so there's a black community in erm i don't know detroit or some lower no i i i use that seriously erm erm some kind of erm work industrial city in america
S0555	yeah yeah
S0405	where it's be populate by work class erm people who be black
S0555	yeah
S0405	and there be then still white people there
S0555	yeah
S0405	and they they can be discriminate against they can be call whatever term you white boy you white whatever i'm sure that i'm sure they at some point
S0555	but the thing be they call
S0405	can i finish
S0555	yeah sorry
S0405	so so at some point these white people have be discriminate against and or they'd be erm discriminate against purely because they're white if they be black it would be different now to put that in the context of the world yes that's so small but of course that's racism
S0555	no no no no no okay okay no the thing be it's not just cos it's small it's because of the fact that can you really compare for example call someone a cracker to someone call someone the n word
S0405	okay
S0555	can you no wait wait wait
S0405	okay okay let's yeah i will
S0555	can you ever compare those two situations
S0402	okay let's i i have an example i have an example yeah
S0405	i'm just about to
S0555	can you can you ever compare those two situations
S0405	yes yes you can and i'm i'm about it
S0555	okay how
S0405	okay so let's say someone again you're not gonna believe me
S0402	to call someone a cracker doesn't have the same connotation though
S0405	listen to me come on please look look look you're not go to believe me cos you're not go to believe that something like this could happen so someone be be
S0555	no no
S0405	someone be be so abuse because he and he's so socially exclude cos he's white that he commit suicide now that be
S0555	okay that's bully that's not that's not racism
S0405	now that be
S0402	possible
S0405	yes that why isn't that racism you're say it be racism it be
S0555	no no no no no but you're talk about cracker you didn't mention the word cracker in that argument at all
S0405	no stop say cracker that's such a trivial statement let's
S0554	what do that even mean where do you take this from
S0555	no but no
S0405	stop think up stop think of racism
S0405	cracker before okay
S0554	not not to me
S0555	erm black people in america say cracker it's like
S0405	if be here she would back up cracker
S0555	yeah right so we're
S0405	okay now how be it that person's
S0402	that be racist and it be bully at the same time it's both racist and bully
S0555	yeah okay so
S0405	okay so but why be it not racist
S0555	no no i know i know as in you say you be gonna compare cracker and the n word you didn't do that
S0405	i didn't no no i didn't compare i say no i i i i didn't say i be gonna compare cracker and the n word i think you be exaggerate that and you're look at racism and think
S0555	no but the thing be
S0405	give me one sec you're look at racism and say okay if you look at it from a profanity point of view then oh look ha ha white racism can't happen to white people cos cracker doesn't mean much but but what the n word be serious so but if you look at it from racism doesn't isn't just someone just say a word on the street racism cause
S0405	no it's funny racism cause people
S0402	stop say cracker
S0555	i haven't say cracker what it's you two
S0402	you say it like thirty second ago
S0555	continue continue continue
S0405	i'm say it cos of you guy i didn't want to bring that up okay racism cause people to commit suicide
S0555	okay
S0405	and discrimination against someone because of their colour be cause people to commit suicide
S0555	okay
S0405	therefore how be it that person's fault why be it not a serious problem because no he hasn't commit suicide because he's be call the c word he's be he's be he's commit suicide
S0555	what
S0405	if i say cracker you're go to give me shit for it
S0555	i think you say cunt
S0554	the c word you can't say the c word
S0405	racism isn't just word it's it's it's social exclusion it can be it can be
S0402	yeah yeah we know that i know that
S0555	no no that's the thing it's not just word it's also historical context that's why that's why the c word
S0405	that's worse
S0405	can we get away from the cracker thing
S0555	no but that's the that's the thing cos
S0405	yeah
S0555	that's how those that's how that's like a point where those two things be not comparable at all because
S0405	i know and i didn't want to compare them it be you guy that bring up that word
S0402	you guy
S0555	no i i i say it and you say you be just about to compare them so
S0405	i'm try to compare no i be gonna compare the seriousness of racism against white people against the seriousness
S0555	okay i i you know okay first of all i i i understand that situation
S0554	we get that we get that
S0555	i guess i guess i guess that okay that situation would be racist but i don't really know
S0405	yes the vast majority happen to black but it can be against white
S0555	no no no no no stop stop you're anticipate what i'm go to say and it's wrong
S0405	yes i be
S0555	but the thing be that racism be systematic and it do not happen on the same level as it do to white people to so people of other people of other race it happen systematically where the point where we be social train to think look at look at a person for example like me and say oh he could he's brown he's a terrorist which be why whenever whenever i go out somewhere like in london my money my money be always check it's always check they always like do the thing on my money
S0405	right
S0555	because it's true i have a beard i'm brown he must be dodgy that's why
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0555	and things like whenever we whenever there's a situation where bag need to be check our bag will always be check if if if we're like if we the come from a muslim family so if your name if you have a muslim sound name it's all the time there be no point where you can compare compare that to the current treatment of white people that's what i'm say
S0405	them people white people commit suicide
S0555	no no no no no no listen to what i'm say
S0405	yes
S0555	that's why you cannot compare that's why you cannot compare because in the state of the unite kingdom today the the state your your you only see racism as an instance racism be not an instance it's a historical system
S0405	mm hm
S0555	which be currently perpetuate negative stereotype on people and enforce behaviour which for for example like they do this experiment where they send in cv's and they put give one person a hispanic name and one person a white name
S0405	mm hm
S0555	and the white and the person
S0402	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0555	with the hispanic name get erm get erm get way way way less responses there be a reason that happen
S0402	yeah load of people change their name to sound more
S0555	exactly my my uncle's change his name
S0405	you yes you can use as many examples as you want
S0555	no but no no
S0405	no i agree with you
S0555	but the thing be you you you why do you only see racism as one instance it's not an instance racism be a system
S0405	okay how about from a
S0555	cos like
S0405	legal standpoint okay erm firstly i agree with everything you say yes racism happen on such a massive scale
S0555	no no but that that's what we disagree on you you you you you seem to be think you seem to think
S0405	and so much history and
S0555	no you seem to think that racism be an instance like something happen that's racist that's not necessarily true
S0405	the reason i'm argue that
S0555	racism happen because there's a system behind it like like if someone seem someone and doesn't like them or like someone like if if someone see me and i and i and i and they look and i like maybe try to steal something from a shop shop or i i like look really and that's why that's why they follow me round the shop
S0405	yeah yeah yeah i get it i get it yeah right
S0555	that's not racist that's they have a reason
S0405	yeah
S0555	but if they see me and they have the automatic assumption because of culture which have perpetuate the idea that people like me
S0405	yeah
S0555	steal things in shop that's racist
S0405	i get what you mean
S0555	but the thing be that that that that perpetuation do not exist for white people on the same level
S0405	right okay
S0555	there's no
S0405	i agree it's not on the same level but if you look at it okay let's take it a different path on a on a legal level you can be fin for incite racial hatred
S0555	yeah
S0405	surely you must agree that you could incite racial hatred against white
S0555	okay yes fine fine
S0402	sure but no one's ever be charge for that
S0555	fine but that have nothing to do with what we be that have nothing to do with
S0405	i'm sure there have be
S0405	it that be the point that i be make because the the way i saw what you be argue be either that racism against white be irrelevant or that it cannot happen
S0555	no no it's
S0402	no no
S0555	it's not it's not irrelevant when it happen and it and it can happen
S0554	and it can happen
S0555	but the thing be i it's racism as it's as when white people talk about racism what they talk about be be rude to someone because maybe they're white it's not it's not the systematic abuse receive receive by a group of people because of a historical which have a historical basis and be perpetuate in modern culture
S0405	okay alright i get what you're say so
S0555	there be there be no equivalent for white people of that kind of systematic abuse
S0405	okay i get you i i'm not try to conflate erm discrimination so but just just so i get in your mind set
S0555	for white people
S0405	so if you look at sexism do you think that sexism can happen to males in the same way it your say female sexism have happen i know it's different and maybe i'm generalise er not generalise but conflate
S0555	you're conflate
S0405	conflate
S0555	i don't think you can compare them you you can't
S0405	but i know they're so different but this be what i see from your logic the the the sexism that be that you would be describe as the racism against minorities and black would be the sexism that have happen to women over thousands of years women
S0555	minorities and black as if black people be not a minority
S0405	yeah yeah erm
S0555	they're special
S0402	let's hope she never hear this podcast
S0405	that that sexism have always happen to females and that's the reason we're in this society it's perpetuate and females be pay less and de de de therefore sexism against males be not part of that systematic system of sexism
S0555	yeah
S0402	yeah
S0554	i think that's right i
S0405	so would you guy not argue that sexism can happen to men
S0555	okay what give me an example of
S0402	i think i think the exact same thing we say er racism can happen to white people it just happen so little that it's not even on the radar again sexism can happen to men
S0405	yeah i think you're argue different point well i think you be but
S0555	i i think i what i think what he mean by little as in
S0402	what he's say be
S0555	it's not back up by any historical basis it's not back up in culture it's not back up systematically
S0405	right
S0402	yeah those be the reason those be the reason why it be so little
S0555	yeah
S0405	but neither be
S0555	but like like you can't compare the two instance like erm a woman say that a man be sex drive that's not the same as a man call a man call i mean a man call a woman a floozy like or like call her a bitch cos you she won't sleep with him or something
S0405	right right okay
S0555	those be two different they're two different power dynamics that you can't compare
S0405	they be different but i think they're they both can be they both can be legitimate
S0402	i think they're pretty similar
S0405	and be serious offenses that we need to deal with
S0555	no but can you can you give me an example of a sexism against men
S0405	sexist against men erm i guess maybe it's a bad example
S0554	women abuse men on the street and no one care
S0405	no cos that you're go to say that's like the incidence thing like i be say about cos that do happen but it's a minority thing
S0554	oh okay
S0555	no that that that's
S0405	so er er
S0555	no but but the the thing be but the thing be that with that example
S0405	i've get a better example
S0555	that's not that's not
S0405	you'd say that happen so much less than
S0555	no no no no no
S0402	that's not as a result of the system
S0555	the the reason that people don't take that seriously
S0405	right
S0555	be because of patriarchy patriarchy be what uphold sexism patriarchy also erm in some instance go against some men for example men who be abuse by their female partner aren't take seriously because a patriarchy state that women be weaker than men men must be er like erm the dominant force in their relationship so to see a man be lower in that way be not take seriously because of patriarchy not because not because she that's sexist it's because of patriarchy that happen
S0405	why can't it be sexism though
S0555	because it isn't because it isn't because
S0402	well it be sexism
S0555	no but it how be it sexism
S0402	well sexism like erm
S0405	because it's just discrimination against someone because of their sex
S0402	discrimination because of their sex
S0405	and because they're male they're not take as seriously
S0402	yeah
S0555	yeah no no they're not the reason they're not take seriously be because be because of the
S0405	right
S0402	cultural societal reason
S0555	yeah because men have be state as superior so
S0402	but it's still it be sexism
S0555	it be it be it's sexist but it's not it's not it's not the same thing as say it's sexism against men because it's still patriarchy which affect which be the same force that oppress women so it's
S0405	right
S0402	yeah but it's not a moral standpoint it's sexist because discrimination be
S0555	yeah no no no i'm say yeah it's sexism but it's not the same type of sexism as
S0402	people
S0555	no it it it it it stem from the same force as the sexism that women face as in it's it's because of the fact that men be consider to be superior to women which be why it's so it's so people see it as so demean or people feel so or people see it as so pathetic to see a man be abuse by women that's because of the same those be the same reason that women be be discriminate against because those those things be similar but i don't think that's different i don't think that's sexism against man men
S0402	right
S0405	but then don't you think just because females tend to er er er be at a disadvantage more than men in those situations it's it's only important to consider the female side of it
S0555	no no no it's
S0405	i really don't get this cos cos okay so so you're say there's this system okay and yes it's sort of the vast majority benefit men but part of that system that we've now realise be because men be in these position of power they feel an inclination to not fail as much and therefore because of that pressure more men commit suicide than women
S0555	yes
S0405	so
S0402	okay
S0405	erm i'm try to relate that to sexism but erm okay so let's let's say if that be sexism because they be not take as seriously as a female who be erm
S0555	like men aren't allow to talk about emotions and stuff like that
S0405	right yeah i guess yeah yeah
S0555	so if he if he talk about his emotions he's consider like weak
S0405	yeah if someone tell him
S0555	you see that that stem from the same force as that oppress women
S0402	exactly so isn't that sexism as well or yeah
S0555	it be it be sexism but it's not the same thing as like cos we're compare it to like white people experience racism it's not the same thing
S0405	no i know i that
S0555	it's not the same it's not the same thing as like be sexist against a man that be the same cos the patriarchy enforce gender roles
S0402	uhu mm hm
S0555	what's happen what would happen in that situation be that a man's gender role isn't be follow he's not be strong or he's not be like stoic or whatever
S0402	right yeah yeah yeah
S0555	his gender roles aren't be follow but the thing be that's not that's not anything to do with women at all that's not anything to do with that that's only to do with gender roles which be enforce by the patriarchy in the first place
S0402	mm i do i do agree with most of the vast majority of what you say
S0555	but like that's why i don't believe in like men's right's activists cos men's men don't need right activists
S0402	but then but i do agree with men right men's right activists
S0554	yeah
S0555	i don't why
S0402	stuff like stuff like it's okay to cry or it's okay to have mental mental health issue as a male
S0555	no no but that no but that's what that's what feminism be about that there should be no gender roles which oppose
S0402	yeah i know
S0555	that oppose that behaviour
S0554	i don't i don't think their should be like an activist group for men to be able to cry
S0555	that's like say it's like say a charity for rich people
S0554	cos cry be just something you do as a human everyone should be able to cry not just
S0555	yeah yeah
S0402	okay you're say that like it's common sense but it's not because so many people commit suicide
S0555	yeah and that's why there's cos feminism be about remove the idea that there be gender roles
S0554	i think that's
S0402	then it should be gender equality
S0555	no but that no but how much of a pedantic do you have to be
S0402	just go men men's right people as in feminists meet up shake hand and call themselves equalitists
S0555	no because why why would you it doesn't make sense it's like it's like when you
S0402	it make perfect sense
S0555	no no it doesn't because it's like we instead of like homophobia we don't go into very specific detail about whatever we don't say like bi phobia or pan phobia or like straight whatever or like erm effeminate phobia you just say homophobia as a broad term the same thing with feminism feminism be a broad term that have a historical context
S0402	yeah but feminism have become synonymous with female right rather than equality
S0405	yeah
S0554	that's just cos what we hear
S0555	no no the no the thing be no the thing be that's because what you hear on like social media be because you don't read you don't read anything about feminism i cos in in english we study feminism most people's conception of feminism be so far remove so far remove from what it actually be
S0402	but whose fault it that
S0555	that isn't anyone's fault
S0402	exactly solve it then
S0554	you you you seem to think that
S0555	but but name it be such a pedantic thing to do
S0402	okay but you be say
S0554	but you understand the effect it would have
S0402	but you be change it it's a rebrand
S0555	perhaps but you you be
S0405	stupid to have men's sex activist group
S0555	men's right men's right
S0405	men's right activist group
S0555	yeah yeah
S0405	surely yes female feminism er as in female right be so much more important and and if they haven't
S0555	but i'm not say that i never say that
S0405	but no but you literally you you say it a few minutes ago you you say men's right group you you don't believe in them or
S0555	yes because that's cos like
S0405	that's just because people don't understand feminism
S0555	i no because no no yes because men's right the idea of the same thing that men's right's activists be say except a lot of them be kind of sexist as well
S0405	right
S0555	the things that they the legitimate things they say they're say be all cover in feminism
S0405	but i don't think i think you say that you shouldn't have men's right group and it should only be feminism further would perpetuate the idea that men that it's not about men it's all about women
S0555	no it wouldn't because why why would it just because of the name
S0402	the problem be you're much more enlighten than the average person
S0405	i don't i don't think that it would
S0555	you're not gonna end this by flattery
S0405	no okay
S0402	no no you be so you look at this and you go well there's no need for men's right group it's so simple look at the feminists but the average person won't understand that
S0405	exactly how many people who
S0555	yes but why should we accommodate ourselves for idiots like
S0405	because that's the majority of society
S0402	because the the majority of people be idiots you you you're like in like the top one percent of intelligent people
S0555	but no i'm not
S0402	who understand shit like this
S0405	and it and it exactly
S0555	no
S0405	and we need to effect the the the mass crowd not just the people like us who can comprehend or look into this
S0402	it's the it's it's the job of the intelligent people to teach the stupid people otherwise there's no point in be intelligent
S0555	no but the things be then why be you divide camp of already establish people into smaller group you don't need to do that
S0405	because most people only attach importance to erm female right which i get yes the majority of you probably should but we need to tackle men's right at the same time well not i wouldn't call them right i'd say
S0555	but the thing be that's what's be happen and in feminism
S0405	right
S0555	the same things be be tackle cos they're tackle under the idea of gender that idea of whether that's why i ask you be there a difference between men and women because also that that's also within feminism those debate be in feminism
S0405	yeah
S0555	and
S0402	yeah but then if that be true then you'd have an equal proportion of men and woman as part of a feminist movement but you don't see that it it's
S0405	well it's harder for feminism feminism affect society far more than
S0555	wait wait but it's harder to be a man
S0402	it's harder to be a man in a feminist group than a woman in a feminist group
S0555	well well first of all
S0402	wait wait wait if what you're say be it should be just cos they're tackle the same problem in general they should be equal you should have an equal proportion of men and women in a feminist group but that's the the thing be it doesn't happen like that it doesn't work like that
S0555	no well well the thing be feminism start as a group which oppose gender roles and it only contain women well it didn't only contain women but most of the members be women because of the fact that they be the oppress group and they be involve in like for example when racism when people start when the civil right movement happen most of the members be people of erm people who be of a minority ethnic group rather than white people but but the thing be like that doesn't damage anything they're still fight for the same things just because they're women doesn't mean they can't and yeah i just don't understand that point it's like
S0402	so no right so if it be what you're say be there's no need for men's right group because feminism
S0555	because the same ideas be hold within feminism
S0402	yeah same ideas so then wouldn't it make by the same logic you should have a shit tonne of men in a in a feminist group because they find so all the people that be in a
S0555	yeah you yeah you should but like i don't know what example you're talk about be there a feminist conference that i be miss like right now that just have like only women
S0402	but then what why i know but whenever you the thing be that people talk about feminists feminism be all women there's no men talk about it
S0555	it's because men don't take it seriously cos they benefit from the system of perpetuation of of the patriarchy
S0402	but you just say they didn't because because men's right group don't need us to fight the same thing
S0555	no but the thing be sometimes they don't sometimes they do for example men benefit in the way that erm for example in in in job people for higher position men be more likely to be select or
S0554	or pay more
S0555	what
S0554	or pay more er like in the same role but pay more
S0555	yeah yeah yeah yeah in the same yeah or be pay more yeah that benefit wait what be my point
S0554	it benefit men
S0555	yeah
S0554	so they don't oppose to it
S0555	yeah yeah yeah it benefit men but in other ways for example like emotional men be not allow to discuss their emotions that that that's a way it it disadvantage men so there be ways that it benefit men there be also ways that it disadvantage men but but yeah
S0405	yeah and i suppose some people would argue that there's ways
S0402	it's a shit argument it's a shitty argument but
S0555	yeah
S0554	and this this before he slaughter you
S0405	okay no miss totally feel this and i'm conflict and think about it but she think that many of the sexist things towards women benefit them she think it's a good thing that women should stay in the home because she's felt that she's be able to erm
S0555	learn
S0405	have better access to her children
S0402	no but what she's do there be what what she's do there be she's enjoy be a mother
S0405	yeah
S0402	and so she's take that it be a good thing because of sexism
S0405	she's take the positives
S0555	but the thing be she she her her inspiration be also from islam
S0402	it doesn't work like that
S0405	yeah
S0555	and the thing be that like that's the thing about feminism feminism be also like if you're a woman you have a right to choose if you follow the gender roles those shouldn't be enforce on you and that's the same thing with men you have the right to you have a right to choose to be hypermasculine but you also have a right not to be and be able to cry and whatever that's the thing people should have the right to choose and the thing be that people don't have the right to choose
S0402	right yeah
S0555	and that negatively affect both men and women women start the movement a long time ago women be include men men have always be include in the movement it's just that it's be so stigmatise by men by men because of the fact that it work against the power structure that benefit them
S0402	right
S0555	that's why
S0405	yeah
S0554	do you think that's why i'm i'm say this seriously this point like
S0555	yeah
S0554	he he be like say how he be like so masculine er he doesn't think
S0555	yeah no that's the thing in in some that's a whole other thing about gay people gay gay men don't like effeminate people like they really don't like effeminate people but also gay men be really racist and they really don't like effeminate people
S0402	wow that's you know you know a generalisation generalise much
S0554	generalise
S0555	no no no no no no you're say
S0405	you're say all gay men don't like effeminate people and be racist
S0555	no no no i'm no i'm not say all i'm not say all gay men i'm the thing be that you guy aren't gay so you don't know
S0405	right
S0555	but for example if you be if you have like a do you know what grindr be
S0402	yeah
S0555	okay it's a it's a gay thing it's like a gay app
S0402	yeah yeah yeah gay tinder
S0555	people people yeah basically like ninety
S0554	everyone know what grindr be
S0555	like basically like ninety five percent of people will say no black no asians whatever they all do it people they'll say also no they'll say no fems which mean no effeminate people
S0554	but be you like be you say that they gay population be whoever use grinder
S0555	no i'm not but the but historically gay people have be very the thing be that you don't know cos you don't know gay culture like i do there's like
S0402	explain explain what you can i guess
S0555	i
S0402	what's the what's the point that you're make about it though
S0555	cos he mention like how i'm just say that's a different thing cos gay people have their own issue about like they don't like effeminate they don't like people who be effeminate
S0402	oh right oh right right oh yeah yeah right yeah yeah
S0555	and that's really bad they don't like people there there there's too much they don't really focus on ethnic minorities who be also not straight
S0402	mm hm
S0555	and that and they also quite a lot of gay people do things or say things which be racist
S0402	why in particular
S0555	i don't know
S0402	cos minorities get away with everything
S0555	also because they're white most most gay people be white
S0402	really
S0555	most out gay people be white cos the majority of this country be white and also you're less likely to be an ethnic minority and have another sexuality other than straight
S0554	yeah yeah ah okay
S0402	right what because
S0555	erm because
S0402	you can't be gay otherwise you'll get murder cos it's not accept
S0555	yeah
S0405	pretty much
S0554	you can't be openly gay
S0555	cos it's more taboo in other countries
S0405	right right
S0555	and i bet you
S0402	have it be more taboo and now we're accept it more
S0405	we're accept it though
S0555	no no no we're accept it
S0402	doesn't mean the rest of the world's accept it no but but
S0554	like when you say we're accept it you mean the country
S0405	people on grindr aren't yeah okay but but people on like grindr that you're talk about that be racist aren't gonna be you know
S0555	that that be just one example
S0405	hide away gays in africa or something
S0555	that that be just one example but like
S0402	but there there be plenty of place in africa where gay where be gay be bad like
S0555	yeah
S0554	you you get jail there
S0402	you get jail time
S0405	yeah
S0555	yeah
S0402	you get jail time there for be gay
S0555	no but that that that's not also there's not just that it's also stuff like in in in countries that that before colonialism use to have same sex erm unions and like stuff it be accept as part of society when colonial colonialism happen the white people be like or british people or i'm sorry to offend you white people british people or the germans or the dutch or the portuguese or whoever come
S0402	french
S0555	the french
S0554	spanish
S0555	whoever spanish they they they
S0402	italians
S0555	and they persecute
S0402	germans
S0555	they
S0554	germans
S0555	i say germans
S0402	americans americans
S0555	they persecute people who weren't straight because they have the they have biblical christianity on their mind and they be like be gay be wrong
S0402	yeah
S0555	that's also so you it's a bite of a generalisation to say back in their home countries because it use to be accept and now it's accept but still on a really minor minor level
S0555	er overall it's still very taboo
S0402	yeah
S0555	like in india the the white people introduce the law that it's illegal to have erm i think it's illegal to have gay sex and they reinstituted that law and then they repeal it they peal it in like two thousand and eleven and they add it back in like a month a year later
S0402	what the fuck
S0555	yeah
S0402	why just
S0555	but they but they er that penal code be only establish because because white people
S0402	reinstate it
S0555	think saw it and they they think it be against their version of christianity so
S0402	yeah
S0405	i'm interest by what you're say about the relationship between homosexuality and the allowance or legalisation of homosexual behaviour and how that relate to culture and race because
S0555	like like for example in like pakistan people think it's like so erm like it must be so horrible to be gay and it be but like there's a huge transgender community in pakistan
S0405	right
S0555	cos there's such a there's such a huge historical context for the transgender community
S0405	right
S0555	there's a huge and in pakistan be one of the one of the few countries in the world which recognise more than two genders like people don't even like the even most of europe don't do that
S0402	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0555	but like people don't think of that because you know they think oh it's a muslim country they must be like really strict but
S0405	right erm why do you think homophobia
S0555	woah i feel like i need to like take a nap
S0402	just this whatsapp fuckers on our group chat
S0554	okay great
S0555	can we can you change the group chat name to like we prefer it without

S0554	so be we do be we do art work be we do art work for it be we
S0405	er we listen to that in ten years and see how it feel in five years
S0402	er you know i think this one get really sharp really quickly
S0555	i feel like i i didn't express my view very well especially with racism
S0405	no but i get i get what you be say
S0555	especially with racism
S0402	so i think for next time if we're gonna do a podcast
S0555	can i say something as well
S0405	yeah

S0402	no no it be like oh yeah fun fun fun fun
S0555	how do we how do we start it
S0402	i go for a piss for like twenty second i come back
S0555	we start on racism what be it about racism
S0405	oh i i i think i ask the question do you believe in reverse racism or something like that
S0555	oh no cos we cos we start with we start the whole thing with like sexism cos i be we we start discuss whether it be innate that males and females be different
S0405	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0555	and that go on to like that develop
S0554	oh yeah because you have your argument
S0555	yeah you and then i just go on
S0405	but i really like that podcast
S0402	i shouldn't have take a piss it wouldn't have go this far
S0405	yeah
S0405	but guy i really like this i i i do erm that be like one of the best for me
S0554	shall we shall we talk about erm
S0402	enrich can we not
S0402	can we talk about like some a giraffe like fall over or something
S0555	yeah
S0405	what what where would have stand in this conversation
S0402	be like
S0555	you see she would whenever black people come up she would intervene that's it that be it that's it that's all the bite she would
