S0530	where i be cos there's load of hill and stuff
S0529	yeah
S0530	like so i use to do like two hour walk at home and all that
S0530	yeah like but serious like uphill walk so it be like it doesn't sound much but like your your legs really hurt
S0531	yeah no well i've be i've be hike before that's awful
S0532	er er
S0530	yeah yeah definitely
S0531	i always like sport where there be like adrenalin cos i absolutely hat exercise but i like
S0530	yeah i like
S0530	the like
S0531	so i like ski and i like horse rid cos you just sit down and the other one
S0531	you just slide downhill so you just go
S0530	yeah
S0531	and you're like oh my god my god this be so
S0529	yeah but ski be like really like
S0531	yeah
S0529	hurt it's not like
S0531	yeah that be true
S0530	oh ski hurt
S0529	it's not like you're just chill out
S0531	yeah it's it's intensive but it's like i dunno adrenalin i mean
S0529	yeah
S0531	i like adrenalin so
S0532	what if the horse kick you off
S0531	mm well then you fall and then you get back on again
S0530	that's the thing about i think that's why i'm so scar
S0532	get on again
S0530	of erm be on a horse it's because like at least say if you're ice skate you kind of have control of your legs
S0531	but you can control where
S0530	of course you have
S0531	it throw you off the thing yeah
S0530	yeah
S0531	you don't like
S0532	yeah
S0531	the fall
S0530	yeah
S0532	but then you when you
S0530	no
S0532	go ski you go oh you go downhill
S0530	because apparently when you're horse rid it doesn't matter how good like of like of a horse rider you be like it's just natural that a the horse will chuck you off sometimes that's fine and then you just go fly and it's just like i couldn't cope with that i'm sorry
S0531	erm
S0530	like i've just see like alright like fairly good riders they just have to learn how to cope when they like fly off
S0531	yeah sometimes it's not so much that they it's just sometimes like say they get spook by sometimes like i've almost be throw off a horse when i be rid out in er sunflower field
S0530	oh right okay
S0531	in france erm because a tractor be out and a horse just didn't like tractors so it almost throw me off but er
S0530	oh my god
S0531	luckily my instructor be there and she manage to calm down the
S0532	be you alright
S0531	i didn't really cos it's on its side and it doesn't feel much so i have to like do it really tightly so that it wouldn't oh

S0530	oh
S0531	that's a quite a lot of sauce she say pour more sauce in
S0530	the more the merrier

S0531	really really loud
S0529	oh you could use songs i didn't know that that's good
S0530	maybe this isn't be there an app for the alarm that you can get that maybe be like really like

S0529	i'll have a look
S0532	probably
S0531	super loud alarm and
S0530	mm super loud alarm or super annoy alarm or
S0529	mm
S0530	impossible to sleep through cos it would save you money
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos you don't wanna have to buy a really expensive alarm clock

S0532	you're a big fan
S0529	yeah i'm such a fan
S0532	you should get your ticket then if you want because er
S0529	i know i'm i need to but i don't wanna go out in the rain so i think they probably will
S0530	that's so good
S0530	that's so cool
S0532	i think i think they're only sell it until i've see some
S0529	yeah but it's now so it's not so i think it say you don't have to get a scarf it just mean that you get like free entry or something
S0532	oh so you can still go
S0529	you can still go yeah it's just more of a like
S0532	it's not really yeah
S0529	a capacity thing
S0532	it's not really a free entry if you have to pay for a scarf
S0529	yeah
S0530	mm
S0529	exactly i just wish i could do a degree in harry potter
S0531	i'm sure there's a place you could do it
S0529	i would ace it
S0530	they're actually introduce that i think in america
S0531	mm
S0530	or somewhere
S0529	of course they be
S0530	no i'm i'm not joke honestly
S0529	yeah no i know
S0530	they're do it they're do they're do it
S0529	like of course they be only america like would do that that's not hard to believe at all
S0530	what do you think all the degrees in the future like what do you think how
S0529	erm probably i dunno gender something like that like more specialise than general women study like i don't know like the mean of gender like because of all the
S0530	mm
S0529	you know the trans awareness and all that stuff go on
S0530	we actually do that in gender women's study
S0529	oh do you
S0530	so yeah we do
S0529	that's good
S0530	intersectionality
S0529	mm
S0530	we do class like how gender basically relate to like
S0529	yeah
S0530	race class sexuality and then we do body image body awareness then we do
S0529	that's cos
S0530	yeah
S0529	everything else seem to be cover
S0530	mm
S0529	although i do think they should make more degrees
S0530	i think it feel like everything's cover but i guess if you look at it properly
S0529	yeah
S0530	i don't think you would think that like
S0529	mm
S0530	i'm try to think what they'd do erm erm there might be like er but then again like degrees they haven't get like i guess they'd make new degrees to make money but then like you see you don't like to work in a nursery you don't need a degree and why would you go to university to cos
S0529	mm
S0530	you can just like
S0531	i feel a lot of the things be like you don't need generally a degree to do them
S0530	mm
S0531	i dunno like
S0530	there's yeah
S0531	you can have a degree in stuff like circus study i mean what be you gonna learn in a lecture about circus study
S0531	you just go to a fuck circus get on the road like
S0531	like it doesn't seem like a think that need a degree like just practice
S0529	have you see in the news that erm universities be gonna start charge extra fee for how good the university teach be
S0530	really
S0529	like if they can prove
S0530	when be that gonna happen
S0529	probably like in the next couple of years they reckon
S0530	so when we've leave
S0529	well hopefully yeah
S0529	just about yeah
S0530	that's like america then
S0529	but it's so what they would i know
S0530	all over again
S0529	so what they're gonna do be like assess how well they be how good the teach be at a certain university and base on that they're gonna charge more for fee
S0530	really
S0529	which be just ridiculous cos they shouldn't be charge anything for fee anyway like it should be free education should be free
S0530	so
S0529	full stop you know
S0530	i'm assume that won't mean that go to like a lower university they're not gonna lower it for lower universities gonna raise it for higher ones
S0529	yeah so they won't take away any money from the lower ones i don't think
S0530	that's crazy
S0529	yeah
S0530	like how much more can they charge
S0530	be that like be there gonna be a big difference
S0529	i don't know i don't know but it's a tory government and like i don't even know like
S0530	and it's five more years of this
S0529	yes i know but yes so it's like yeah so basically like there's like a place in the top ten that can prove that they've get extra teach standards will be able to raise their grade erm their price
S0530	fuck hell
S0529	i know and they're also and it's funny because they're say now that universities shouldn't focus so much on students' examination result erm as a kind of like which be kind of true they shouldn't
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	but also like that's more pressure on the students
S0530	mm
S0529	yeah so they're gonna do more of an american style like grade like have er like termly progress for students like
S0530	but then
S0530	well that's
S0529	how they do it in america
S0530	bullshit because what you say about the thingamajig it's gonna be the richest kid go to the top universities
S0529	yeah
S0530	not the most academically gift necessarily
S0529	yeah
S0530	so i think that be the point of university like
S0529	well
S0530	equal
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	like equality for all where everyone go but no apparently not
S0529	well i mean i expect there'll still have scholarships and stuff but it's just gonna get
S0530	but not everyone
S0529	no
S0530	can get a scholarship
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	very few
S0529	it's just gonna be a lot harder to get yeah like less people who aren't necessarily really intelligent will be able to go to the top universities because they won't be able to afford it
S0530	mm
S0529	like yeah
S0530	life be just not fair be it
S0529	it really isn't someone put this like really funny inspiration video on facebook and i actually watch it for once and it be really good it be like whoa shit like
S0530	what what do it say
S0529	it be like matrix style like we're all just like follow rule in this massive big system
S0530	be that the be that the one with the big voiceover
S0529	it's yeah i watch it today it be so epic cos people have be like post it and stuff it's be around for age i don't know it's
S0530	i've
S0529	suddenly
S0530	yeah i've see that
S0529	crop up again but
S0530	it's like we're live to work our live away
S0529	yeah
S0530	that one yeah i watch that and whenever i watch stuff like that everyone's just like what be the point
S0529	yeah literally
S0529	it just make you feel more depress rather than like want to change something and just like oh for fuck's sake
S0530	it's like we're live in a world by found by
S0529	yeah
S0530	by and capitalism and shit and
S0529	but the bite about destroy and the earth be really sad
S0530	it be like in the last fifty years we've destroy i can't remember what it be it's like seventy five percent of the world's rain forest or something
S0529	yeah
S0530	it's that's really sad like
S0529	mm
S0530	humanity be quite scary actually
S0529	yeah
S0530	what we're capable of
S0529	i mean we think we're so intelligent but we're really not
S0530	we think we're superior we've get a superior
S0530	complex that's what i be actually explore in my erm not in my essay but in my read
S0529	mm
S0530	it be talk about how like how humans be different to animals it's not necessarily that we're more intelligent than other animals it's because we believe we're better than other animals
S0529	yeah
S0530	and that's what's unique about humans basically that we just think yeah
S0531	i'm sure other animals think they're more superior than us
S0530	no no but we feel like we're superior to all the animals like we believe we own all the animals we believe that we should like have all the animals kind of thing rather than like yeah
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	cos imagine a society where humans and animals be equal
S0529	mm
S0530	that would be strange like treat well if cat weren't pet but they be like humans like
S0529	well i think we'd all be vegetarians
S0530	yes we would join
S0531	apart from if it be the last
S0529	vegans we'd all be vegans
S0530	vegans
S0529	would still be she's need to can you imagine
S0531	well
S0530	yeah would eat dog would eat hamster
S0529	yeah you would
S0531	i wouldn't eat hamster i don't think hamster would taste very nice
S0530	i think you be go to say oh i'm not that mean i wouldn't eat a hamster but no a hamster
S0530	doesn't taste very nice
S0531	well it's a little squiggly thing like why would you wanna eat that
S0530	that's fluffy and yeah
S0531	there's probably no meat on it
S0530	it's i i don't know it's quite like burger size isn't it like it's
S0531	yeah if you look yeah but if you look at the size of the animal and the size of meat you can get from it it's like it's unless it be gonna be like brain head gut feet
S0530	oh
S0531	that kind of stuff you'd probably just eat like the tummy part
S0529	mm
S0531	that's not very good
S0530	yeah
S0531	sorry i'm gross you out cos you
S0530	no no that's fine
