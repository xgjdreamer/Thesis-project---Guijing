S0109	mm
S0123	it be pretty good actually well i like it i don't i don't
S0034	those things be not synonymous
S0123	i don't i don't usually like um leonard cohen stuff that's what's impressive about it
S0109	see the thing be i listen to his uh live tour whatever it be album and my favourite thing on there be one that he write but he didn't sing
S0123	hm that's usually my my attitude towards leonard cohen be he's usually better cover so he write really good songs but he just doesn't seem to have the i mean his songwriting ability exceed his own ability to perform them so um i mean hallelujah's the famous example um but um bird on a wire i mean
S0109	i i might
S0123	apparently he struggle with depression all his life and um you can tell it when he write line like be it like a be it it's like like like a beast with its horn like a baby stillborn i have tear at everyone who reach out for me
S0109	nice
S0109	cheery
S0123	the new one's get load of i mean he jewish it's get load of really christian sound stuff like he's you know um stuff like take me to the place where you'll wash the clean by the blood of the lamb um yeah there's lot of of yeah biblical well obviously um what sound like new testament analogies as well interest interest chap still massively depress as well not massively depress but sort of like some of the line be like um it's like i know that you hate me but could you hate me less i mean like a song sing to an ex lover

S0123	that mean you reverse down the one way road which be illegal
S0123	cos you're point in the right direction
S0034	cos you're point in the right direction and you can drive better so it make a lot of sense
