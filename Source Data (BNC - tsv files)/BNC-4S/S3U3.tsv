S0392	to do
S0391	be ready we think right well we'll we'll get a dance to go with it
S0390	right
S0391	it's very very simple to be honest
S0390	be be be you what do you call it copyright these tune and dance
S0393	no
S0391	no they're all old they're really old
S0392	no the minute the minute they're bear they're automatic
S0392	that's the way international intellectual right work in this country the minute you've write it it's automatically copyright
S0390	be you sure
S0392	yeah yeah
S0391	yeah but the way but the way the tune you use that you didn't write that's what might mean
S0392	oh no they're old
S0391	they're so old
S0392	no one know who write them any more
S0390	oh no i be mean the ones
S0391	traditional
S0390	that they make up
S0393	we do a lovely one
S0392	well it's more i make them up really
S0393	call the a nineteen set cos they're tune just from the villages round about here
S0390	hey that's good
S0393	yeah people like them and they're good good those be good tune aren't they
S0390	yeah from the fiddler of
S0393	mm
S0392	so if i write a tune i don't need to
S0390	mm
S0392	there's no procedure it's er automatically copyright
S0390	but what about copyright on literary work
S0391	if you put a c with a circle round it it's it's
S0392	you don't even need to put the c
S0390	i'm say this because i once write a short story
S0393	do you
S0390	and i send it off to woman's weekly
S0393	and they rip you off
S0390	erm yeah well
S0390	no surprise there
S0390	two or three months later the same story appear the same storyline
S0392	ah
S0391	oh
S0390	and it be so personal
S0392	well you can't copyright an idea
S0391	you can't copyright a line and an idea
S0393	what be the story about
S0390	oh it be just about something that have happen a garage you you don't remember when i put diesel in a petrol car and i weave a story round it how the girl sort of meet somebody she'd know age ago you know one of these simple little stories for the woman's weekly and i be mad er mad
S0393	you didn't send it to people's friend by mistake
S0390	no i send it to the
S0393	no
S0390	woman's weekly
S0392	yeah but to be honest you can't copyright an idea you can only copyright the
S0393	you can copyright a short story though can't you
S0391	yeah but it be just a similar storyline you wouldn't
S0392	copyright the idea for it though
S0393	yeah
S0392	text
S0390	yeah but it be obvious that it be the one i have put forward
S0391	yeah
S0390	so i've never send any more after that
S0392	oh that's happen to me before
S0390	have it love
S0392	yeah
S0390	ah
S0393	what happen
S0392	er
S0390	oh be your heart go
S0391	you can't copyright a title can you
S0392	i keep miss the close date for that
S0391	you can't copyright a title
S0390	so so what's this about put a circle with a c
S0391	mm
S0392	that's just a symbol to remind people that it's copyright you don't need one for it to be copyright it's just sort of like to remind people or to scare people into not photocopy it cos if it's not there you're likely to go and photocopy it or pass it off as your own but if it be there then it remind you a bite more
S0390	okay so i maybe should've put that on yeah
S0393	when when be this a while ago
S0391	computers make things easier because you've get proof on your computer
S0390	it be after you and and have leave home so it's not that long ago maybe about fifteen before we come over here fifteen sixteen years ago

S0390	oh well in that case it if its get some good pencil i'll get
S0392	yeah they might be move onto i'm try to think fifty issue they'll struggle to think of different art things to do after that but they might be do things like watercolour or something in the end
S0390	well it be art therapy and i think it cos honest i've get no talent you know i just know i haven't
S0391	you don't you don't need to be an artist for art therapy
S0390	no course you don't er er apparently it's very de stress
S0391	it be if you if you get in touch with your inner child you use your non dominant hand and do do stuff
S0390	ah i've be read about that
S0391	do stuff with that
S0390	do you know if you want to write something really meaningful it be suggest that you use your non dominant hand
S0392	oh well in badminton on thursday there's two of us that take it seriously and there be a double tournament so what we do we play leave hand we still beat everyone seven nil
S0392	but we play with our leave hand instead
S0392	so er that help us be inner children
S0390	but can you write with your leave hand
S0392	no but i play badminton with it
S0390	cos your your grandad could write with either hand
S0392	i can't write with my leave hand
S0390	i could always tell which hand he be write with
S0392	the person i sit next to in english break their leave hand which be their main hand so they have to write with their right hand and honestly you couldn't tell after a week of have to use their right hand fully you just couldn't tell at all
S0391	mm
S0390	well i have a time when i be use my leave my right hand and i be get do you know 's brother
S0391	mm
S0390	well one of them have go to school oh have be leave hand and they'd tie her hand behind her back well something have happen to one of them anyway their hand be tie behind their back
S0391	mm
S0390	and so spend age teach to use his right hand force him to use his right hand so he wouldn't have his hand tie behind his back
S0391	yeah it's awful isn't it
S0390	isn't it terrible
S0391	in er early years now they do a lot of stuff with erm maybe something like spaghetti because a lot of children especially if they're in nurseries from the year dot they don't raise their arm very high and so they get them
S0390	really
S0391	pull out spaghetti because they don't even know which their dominant hand be so they get them pull spaghetti out of a ball with their right hand
S0392	just give them a football and see which one they kick it with
S0391	how how high can you lift it now pull with your leave hand how high can you lift it little girls often haven't play ball game they haven't lift their hand above their head so they don't know which their dominant hand be
S0390	do you know that be so sad
S0391	they get up to age five and six
S0392	just i know what you can do push them over and see which foot out or which hand go down to the grind
S0391	oh some of them aren't even coordinate they're they're like toddlers
S0391	so and do cheerleader things give them things to shake above their head that help them find their dominant hand but often it take a lot longer these days especially for be in nursery from a very young age
S0393	you could do a bakery class and the the spoon that they
S0392	that's a small
S0393	i know
S0391	well you you don't know what four year olds be like
S0393	look at it it just shrink every
S0392	fit me soon
S0393	i'm tell you now
S0393	i bet you no go on please
S0391	if you give a
S0392	the sleeves be too
S0393	i wanna see if it fit you cos
S0391	if you give
S0393	every jumper i ever get shrink
S0391	if you give a reception child a spoon
S0393	no just try it go on
S0392	i'll put it on later
S0393	mm
S0391	if you give a reception child a spoon whatever hand you put it in they would
S0393	well that's good
S0391	that's what i'm say
S0393	you can teach them to be ambidextrous
S0391	yeah but they will some of them will be ambidextrous but some'll develop it
S0390	yeah but it's not very many
S0391	no most of them will develop a dominant hand
S0390	mm
S0392	right
S0391	so it's give them the opportunity
S0390	mm
S0391	to develop it or find it early on
S0393	right
S0390	there's still suspicion not not not now when i be leave hand there be still a lot of suspicion about people who be leave hand
S0391	right
S0393	be sinister
S0390	yeah sinister exactly
S0392	unnatural
S0390	yeah
