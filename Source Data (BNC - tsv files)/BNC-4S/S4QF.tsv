S0251	erm his academic circle and him
S0368	oh i see
S0251	that sort of thing
S0368	oh right
S0368	oh well i know nothing of this

S0251	yeah
S0368	yeah cos he's change his mind hasn't he the one who's get in
S0251	have he
S0368	yeah
S0251	about what
S0368	about the debt that they owe
S0251	oh right oh that's strange isn't it
S0368	mm
S0251	well do
S0368	yeah you know with germany
S0251	oh right
S0368	yeah that's erm
S0252	i think
S0368	a bite
S0251	mm
S0368	mm
S0252	it be possibly a little bite self impose in a way because if they'd collect ten years' worth of tax revenues
S0368	mm
S0252	like they should have collect
S0368	yeah
S0252	it would hardly have any debt at all
S0368	yes but it's the same with erm even on a local level erm the council don't collect the rent as they should
S0251	mm
S0368	you know on council estates
S0251	yeah they just mm
S0368	and they don't collect the erm er community charge like they should do
S0251	oh right
S0252	the the thing be whether it's local government or national government it have get to be run as a business you know
S0369	absolutely
S0252	have to get your fund and get money in in order to pay for all the service
S0368	of course you have yeah
S0252	that need
S0368	yes
S0252	deliver
S0368	now erm er years ago when i go about 's community charge or something like that you know how much they owe you know in council tax or rent and they're say well this have get to be pay and they say well can i pay fifty p a week
S0251	mm
S0368	say well no you can't because you already owe two years
S0251	yes
S0368	back
S0251	it would never come right
S0368	that's before
S0368	that's before this you know
S0251	yes
S0368	how many months
S0251	mm
S0368	so no it it just won't do but
S0251	mm
S0368	if that's if they've get fifty p
S0251	mm
S0368	to spare what what be they gonna do i don't know they can't say you're gonna have to erm pay ten pound a week because they'd say well we don't have it
S0251	well no
S0368	so i i don't know how it go on
S0369	but the thing be what's
S0368	i think council tax and rent should be take off
S0251	you put it first yes
S0368	off any they usually
S0369	benefit
S0368	get
S0251	on benefit mm
S0368	mm yeah
S0251	mm
S0368	benefit or unemployment or
S0251	mm
S0368	something it should be take first
S0251	mm
S0369	but there may be a law
S0368	you can't do that
S0369	where you can't do that
S0368	no
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	the er competition market authority have er make a er a a sort of er notice of some concern
S0368	mm
S0252	in regard to richard branson operate the east coast main line
S0369	have he
S0251	oh right
S0252	yes
S0369	mm
S0252	er problems be that there would be insufficient competition between erm grantham and newark and edinburgh to dundee because there would be er too much of the service would be run by
S0369	by branson
S0252	stagecoach be virgin and its company because between newark and grantham the only other sort of competition be east midlands train which be also which be a stagecoach company
S0251	oh right
S0252	and erm between edinburgh and dundee a significant amount of the service be run by scottish citylink coach service which be also stagecoach
S0369	yes
S0252	so they've get a week to er suggest how such issue can be remedied
S0369	hey when you think about that run the distance between newark and grantham
S0252	yes
S0369	it's not all that great be it
S0251	be it the next stop
S0369	more or less
S0369	there's not much in it
S0252	mm
S0369	and so you know they've get all that run and then just
S0251	that bite
S0369	a little bite in the middle
S0251	no no no
S0369	no
S0251	what about edinburgh to dundee be that a long
S0252	that be a
S0251	piece
S0252	very good stretch
S0369	yeah
S0251	yes
S0369	that that would be a bite longer wouldn't it but nevertheless
S0368	so there isn't enough competition be that what they're say
S0252	they're say that
S0251	yeah
S0252	well currently it's the east coast be hold by the state so the issue of competition doesn't exist because
S0368	no
S0252	the state doesn't compete with itself
S0368	no
S0252	but because it will be operate by stagecoach and virgin
S0368	yeah
S0252	there's they the competition and market authority doesn't think there'll be enough competition between those rout because i think about nearly eighty or ninety percent of the service would be operate by them which then put them in a position to either increase their price
S0368	yeah
S0252	or reduce their service frequencies
S0369	mm
S0252	which would not be in the interest of the traveller
S0251	mm true mm
S0368	mm well i don't understand
S0251	i don't know why they have to sell it anyway really
S0369	i don't
S0368	no
S0251	it seem to be go on alright
S0369	yeah i mean to be honest i would have er like british railways back again
S0252	mm
S0251	it wasn't popular at the time but
S0369	no it's not popular or let me put it this way you'd think it's not popular
S0251	mm
S0369	because you've get like the certain section of the community
S0251	mm
S0369	like the media
S0251	mm
S0369	type of thing start niggle away at it
S0251	mm
S0369	you know make
S0251	comment about the sandwich
S0369	or the sausage roll even
S0251	yeah
S0369	yes it's that type of thing
S0251	mm
S0369	exactly that and say out costly it be to run
S0251	mm
S0369	and er and there be because it's it's er like government money shall we say
S0251	mm
S0369	for example don't forget when i first start work it be a private company
S0251	mm
S0369	with shareholders
S0251	mm
S0369	and it be call and it have a number of bus company of which be one
S0251	mm
S0369	and we use to have directors' visit once maybe twice a year
S0251	mm
S0369	or certainly once a year when everything have to go and be clean up and that
S0251	mm
S0369	and it be run to er er a profit for the shareholders
S0251	mm
S0369	now then it become nationalise
S0251	mm
S0369	no shareholders really
S0251	no
S0369	and we get a new fold machine a new guillotine
S0251	mm
S0369	er and in other departments there be more equipment come in
S0251	mm
S0369	cos it's government money
S0251	yes
S0369	and things be better
S0251	better equip
S0369	really
S0251	mm
S0369	mm but because it's er government money the have all sort of things do because government money mean it be a bite like i be talk to a doctor there er and he say this be next door like and he say er i don't know he say get a bite of a problem on here he say i've something like er er ten thousand pound to spend on er
S0368	the surgery
S0369	surgery type of thing it be a like a a
S0368	clinic a clinic
S0369	a clinic mm like an antenatal clinic and that
S0251	mm
S0369	type of thing and this have get something like you know ten thousand grand to spend there
S0251	mm
S0369	and he say i can't see really what we want
S0251	no
S0369	he say i think i'd do well say right get rid of all the chair we'll have some new ones
S0251	yeah
S0369	but you see it's nowhere near cover it
S0251	mm
S0369	you see they've get the money
S0251	mm
S0369	but what
S0251	what to do with the money
S0369	do we do with it now
S0251	mm
S0368	and then if they don't spend it
S0369	you if they don't
S0368	this year they don't get it next year
S0369	spend they won't get it next year
S0251	yeah
S0369	and so you know that's that's the way
S0368	mm
S0369	er sort of government body work
S0251	mm
S0369	they've get the grant and they've get to spend it now and er now then when it become a national bus company there be we have all sort of things you know some big some small of er things happen and then of course margaret thatcher come in and er sort of stop that and corporation corporation even have to sell their bus off to
S0251	mm
S0369	to stagecoach get them we be okay but er up against they be deem too big
S0251	mm
S0369	so some of it of have to come into you know all stuff
S0251	mm
S0369	like that go on and er but there wasn't much more er equipment and that come in then
S0251	mm
S0369	but it's all be pay for by government all the best equipment
S0368	mm
S0369	and this be how it go it er when it's government money when it's
S0251	mm
S0369	corporation money public fund
S0251	yeah it doesn't matter so much
S0369	yeah it don't matter nobody seem to be accountable for it
S0251	no
S0252	in the in the railways erm the fund be actually more now even account with inflation than the days of british rail
S0369	be it
S0252	it's more expensive by about
S0369	mm
S0252	nearly twice as much
S0369	yeah but the thing be there
S0252	and we haven't really get any massive project i mean if you think about nineteen ninety one nineteen ninety two the whole of the east coast main line be electrify
S0251	yeah
S0252	it be a big project and we hadn't
S0252	really see anything like that
S0369	mm
S0368	no
S0369	but now isn't it split up there's the network rail they look after the track and all that business
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah
S0369	and somebody else look after the
S0251	train roll stock
S0369	you know so the it
S0252	it's very complicate yes
S0369	it be this be it and in all that
S0251	separate
S0369	complication
S0252	mm
S0369	there'll be a lot of money transfer and
S0252	yeah
S0369	float about and
S0368	oh it be
S0252	i mean network rail you could just about say that that be the government
S0368	right
S0252	but they the company who run the train be
S0369	on the rail like virgin
S0252	yeah and first and stagecoach and
S0369	mm
S0252	quite a significant amount of those be also stake of different countries
S0251	mm
S0252	erm which be sort of expect the passenger
S0369	mm
S0368	mm mm
S0252	for example arriva be own by the german state it's
S0369	yeah
S0368	be it
S0252	part of deutsche bahn
S0369	i be just gonna say what about er you know the er euro train who's
S0252	it's er that's our business that really the various er in our but it look as though that be go to be sell off
S0369	sell off yeah
S0252	yeah
S0369	to whom french
S0252	there's lot of bidders in at the moment they haven't choose anybody yet but we've get a singapore asset firm erm we've get erm who else have we get we've get er edf energy de france
S0369	oh yeah
S0252	which be own by the french state
S0369	that's french isn't it mm
S0252	we've get one which be a bite surprise be the erm i think it be the
S0252	nottinghamshire pension fund for er the state workers of nottingham
S0369	be it really
S0252	really
S0369	nottingham
S0252	erm we've get i think prudential in line with a a pension show have put in a bid
S0251	mm
S0252	erm
S0369	so some of these be amalgamate to
S0252	mm
S0369	come into purchase it
S0251	well they just don't do any bid at the moment
S0252	yeah
S0368	mm
S0252	yeah
S0368	mm
S0252	but they plan and the
S0368	mm so in the end would it be one one group this
S0252	yes it would
S0368	oh
S0252	just one bidder will win which
S0368	yeah
S0369	mm
S0252	i mean some have put a giant bid in
S0368	yeah
S0252	erm
S0368	yeah so why be we sell it then
S0252	it's allegedly to help the deficit but the amount of money it will raise be not go to put er well
S0369	no
S0252	it's hardly a dent er i think it bring it down from about eighteen point four trillion to eighteen point two or something like that so
S0368	mm yeah
S0369	that's for sell that off then
S0252	no it's not
S0369	mm
S0252	much money i think erm governments in recent years have be very afraid to own anything it it's just er
S0368	mm
S0252	some kind of ideology that it be privately own be the best way about it
S0368	i would have think it be an asset wouldn't you
S0251	mm
S0369	like the silver it's
S0251	well yeah i
S0368	yes
S0252	it's a national
S0368	yes
S0252	asset
S0369	mm the family silver
S0368	yeah
S0251	i think we should keep full control
S0368	yeah so do we own it jointly with france
S0252	we own erm forty percent be it no forty five percent the french state own fifty percent and the belgian state own five percent
S0368	oh do they right
S0252	yes
S0369	but it go to their
S0368	yes
S0369	that that
S0368	yes it go to the
S0369	obviously countries and belgium as well
S0368	that's right yeah
S0369	mm
S0368	no i
S0252	another thing be
S0251	mm
S0252	even if we be go to sell it now be not the time to sell it because they're go to get they'll have have order and i think next year some new train will be come with the intention to do new rout to amsterdam and frankfurt and er geneva so obviously that's go to be a new venture
S0368	a source of income isn't it yeah
S0252	and obviously it's a new stream of income
S0368	yeah
S0251	mm
S0252	that all be well will
S0369	mm
S0252	add to the value of the firm so my concern be be that the firm's value will rise in the next five to ten years
S0368	mm
S0252	significantly because of that
S0368	mm yes
S0369	well people do travel more don't they
S0251	mm
S0368	yes
S0369	mm
S0368	well it's a good a good way of travel isn't it on that
S0251	yes i think so
S0252	i think
S0369	and
S0252	they have er get a bite of an issue with expansion largely due to the sort of the passport issue that er passengers must have their passport check at the station so the train have to be at a seal platform and obviously
S0368	mm
S0252	that's create a bite of a problem
S0369	yeah
S0252	for er create new rout so it's kind of limit its expansion a bite and it look as though that these new rout everyone will have to get off at lille to go through security
S0369	mm
S0368	oh
S0369	cos at the airport
S0368	mm
S0369	you go you know out of one area more or less into a gift shop but you can't go back once you're through there
S0251	no mm
S0252	mm
S0369	and then you go through for the plane don't you
S0251	yeah you're like in a no man's land really
S0369	yes you you're
S0252	yes
S0369	stick there mm well it'll have to be like that at at the train then wouldn't it
S0251	mm
S0369	that's what you're say it's security have to come into it mm
S0252	yes
S0369	but you see this the ideology of of what you're say there this be where the politics come into it isn't it
S0251	mm yeah
S0369	you know and really er the politics be be you've get er well like sort of conservative type politics on one hand and at the other end you've get these er republicans and that who you know do away with this and do oh dear oh dear
S0251	mm
S0369	instead of really people should decide what they want to do and then go to that country like if you want to be a republican go to ireland that's a republic
S0251	mm
S0369	or wherever
S0368	mm
S0369	er but don't start disturb it here
S0251	it never happen like that though do it
S0369	no no
S0251	they try and change
S0369	yeah
S0251	what there be
S0369	they change it here
S0368	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	it's a i think they fail to see that the eurostar be potentially a steady stream of income
S0368	mm
S0252	you know it's
S0369	mm
S0252	money that it the government doesn't have to do very much to get it
S0369	no
S0251	no
S0252	and
S0369	no they've do
S0252	obviously if they they see it be an asset that's bring money in it can help pay for other things like the nhs and that type of thing
S0368	mm
S0251	over the one yeah
S0252	and then attempt to not to really have to sort of increase tax be er
S0368	mm
S0252	the bottom line really
S0369	but you see they've pay for the up get it up and run
S0252	mm
S0369	all the infrastructure
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0369	all the admin that it take
S0251	mm
S0369	er and that and then somebody else be gonna get the benefit of it all
S0251	let it go yeah
S0252	yeah
S0369	and i would say
S0251	yeah
S0369	that the eurostar be more popular than er who be it agatha christie's er
S0251	murder on the orient express
S0369	orient express yeah to vienna
S0252	mm
S0369	i would say it's just as er
S0251	successful
S0369	desirable to travel
S0251	mm
S0369	on eurostar as orient express
S0251	mm
S0252	mm one thing that do have to be take into consideration be because the french state be the majority
S0368	mm
S0252	holder that it have fifty percent that it be allow to charge a premium on top of the price agree for the forty percent stake of the uk government
S0251	mm
S0252	ie it's able to charge a sixteen percent surcharge
S0368	on the fare
S0252	on the no i mean the amount the firm pay for the uk government's stake
S0368	oh right yeah
S0252	the french state can
S0368	oh
S0252	charge a sixteen percent er
S0368	yeah
S0252	supplement on top
S0251	oh right
S0252	of that because it's a majority shareholder
S0368	oh i see so who's pay for all these new er carriages and all in this
S0252	it will be split between the
S0368	two oh
S0252	the three governments
S0368	the three yeah
S0252	yeah
S0368	mm
S0252	mm
S0368	mm
S0252	and
S0368	well i should imagine that's quite a a large sum isn't it
S0252	yes
S0369	mm oh yeah
S0252	it's
S0369	mm
S0252	and it's the er it's a lot of money yeah
S0368	yeah a few million
S0252	it's be a few million it's
S0251	yeah
S0252	be about about ten million pound per set yeah
S0368	mm
S0369	when we're talk about infrastructure well you're talk about some towns and some station they're have to enlarge
S0251	mm
S0369	you know
S0368	mm
S0369	make it longer
S0251	mm the platform
S0369	this the platform
S0368	yes
S0251	for the length of the train
S0369	for
S0368	yeah yeah
S0369	the train to match the train
S0251	mm
S0369	you know it's not er it's not just put a couple of more machine in like
S0368	mm
S0252	but even order those new train have create a big situation really
S0369	mm
S0368	really
S0252	because the tender process be do the uk way and not the french way
S0368	oh
S0252	er when it's do the uk way you sort of invite everybody to
S0368	yeah
S0252	put in a bid and they eventually award siemens of germany to build them
S0368	i be just gonna say
S0252	but the
S0368	that they get it
S0252	the french way of do it be to hand it over to a french company
S0369	mm
S0252	erm which be would be alstom of france so er alstom launch a lawsuit against it
S0368	yeah i don't blame them either
S0252	because siemens win the contract but
S0368	yeah
S0252	they didn't get anywhere with it
S0368	they've still get it have they
S0252	they've still get it yes

S0369	which will run round to different hotels
S0251	yeah drop
S0369	drop you off
S0251	yeah
S0251	and your

S0251	stagger in and want to lie down and
S0369	mm
S0252	that be one good thing about rail be that it take you bang on in the centre doesn't it
S0368	yes
S0252	mm
S0369	mm
S0368	mm

S0369	and er and then the next day be
S0251	mm
S0369	wherever wasn't it
S0251	yeah
S0369	but the train it definitely the best travel
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0251	i think so
S0369	you know so long as the proviso you're face the right way
S0368	oh right that's right isn't it yeah
S0368	some people
S0252	and you've reserve a seat
S0368	make a fuss about it don't they
S0251	mm

S0251	or you've get a
S0368	that
S0251	kind person with you who will swap with you
S0369	yes
S0368	yes
S0369	that's another thing
S0369	yeah
S0368	yes
S0252	i have look at do italy via rail but er it's just a little bite too far to do from in a day and so you can do it from london or ashford
S0369	mm
S0252	in one day
S0251	oh right
S0369	er to italy by train
S0252	erm
S0368	yeah
S0252	in one day
S0369	yes i would say so mm er what go into what rome or something or
S0252	it would be well if you catch the first eurostar of the day which be five forty from london or six twenty eight from ashford
S0369	i'll listen to this back
S0252	erm you could be er in milan for or at five o'clock in the even
S0251	oh
S0369	milan mm mind you
S0368	well we
S0252	and it would be
S0368	we go to spain didn't we
S0252	efficient
S0368	we do spain didn't we
S0252	yes
S0369	by train
S0368	yes
S0369	well they they have this er they call it the golden rail
S0368	mm

S0369	they saw our luggage with the mark on like and they come er company so the company's saw us like onto the seat and it be all book through weren't we
S0368	mm
S0369	er one night in paris
S0368	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	go across go to folkestone and from folkestone i think we go to boulogne or somewhere and then on a train there to paris
S0368	mm
S0369	we get to paris about what seven in the morning
S0368	mm and then we have breakfast
S0369	and i go we have our breakfast there didn't we
S0369	er i go to get shave and i say to this er like where can i get shave and that in there like so i go in there and just get start there be all women come out of the bloom toilets and that that i i'm in the wrong spot here

S0251	english boys be not use to that sort of thing
S0368	no
S0369	absolutely not
S0369	not have my private shave as well
S0369	that wasn't
S0368	yeah
S0252	a very good shave
S0368	no
S0251	it wasn't no
S0369	you know the nervous
S0251	rush
S0368	yeah
S0369	tension be there wasn't it
S0368	yeah
S0368	well we we decide we'd have a an english breakfast
S0251	mm
S0368	er and you pay extra
S0251	yes
S0368	so erm okay we when it come it be
S0251	they didn't know how to do it yeah
S0368	i think they'd put the bacon in and
S0369	pull it out again
S0368	turn it over
S0251	yeah
S0368	and that
S0369	it be
S0368	be that
S0251	virtually raw
S0368	it be awful wasn't it
S0252	it would have be
S0368	we would have be better off with a
S0251	other yeah
S0368	with the er
S0251	a croissant
S0252	a croissant
S0368	croissants yeah
S0368	but yeah and i say
S0369	but
S0368	your dad say oh well we'll have a good breakfast and then
S0251	yes it'll last
S0368	you know it er will last us a bite so but we didn't
S0252	you can definitely do spain in one day now or even
S0368	can you
S0252	yes
S0368	oh right
S0252	er it's five hours to
S0251	five be that true
S0252	barcelona from paris yes
S0251	oh right
S0252	by train yeah
S0369	well that that's not too bad be it really
S0368	no
S0369	well it's better than get up at i don't know and er what time do you have to go though for that
S0252	erm well i think they do five train a day cos it be do five train a day from paris so
S0369	really cor
S0252	er if you've get the first train of the day at
S0368	yes
S0252	er and say you could get into barcelona in the same day
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	oh and er
S0368	that might be an option
S0369	who who's run that be that
S0252	it's you just kind of it's not
S0369	like a travel company
S0252	erm as like a travel company
S0369	mm
S0252	it will be that you just book a a a normal train service between
S0369	mm
S0252	to york and then york to london and then london to paris and then paris to barcelona
S0368	mm
S0369	maybe the golden rail ticket come back that will be another
S0368	yes
S0368	it be a long time ago
S0252	yes the only downside be be you have to cross paris which be a bite of a nuisance
S0369	yeah yeah it's and it's that downside which could be er quite a problem
S0252	i mean luckily all international ticket be cover by the
S0252	which mean that if your train be late erm you will be transfer to the next one or put up in a hotel
S0369	mm
S0251	oh right
S0252	erm until
S0368	yeah
S0252	you can travel
S0368	mm
S0252	if your
S0368	mm mm
S0252	till you eventually get there
S0368	mm
S0252	mm mm
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0368	well it might be better than go by plane you know for a trip isn't it
S0369	well there'll be there'll be similar from i should imagine
S0368	yeah
S0369	anyway it's from though
S0368	yeah
S0369	mind you you see the thing be go to york
S0368	yeah
S0369	and york be a hub
S0368	yeah
S0369	railway isn't it
S0368	well we would go to york wouldn't we
S0369	we'd probably go to york yes
S0368	yeah
S0369	from mm
S0252	there be a six er half sixish train from to london
S0369	mm
S0252	that will take about
S0368	mm
S0252	two hours and forty minutes so
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0252	i mean you i would say it wouldn't be much different because the first train of the day from be about twenty to seven
S0369	mm
S0368	right
S0252	but obviously you've get that earlier train direct to london from
S0368	mm
S0252	no it's a when you think about it er you can definitely get quite far away in a day by train
S0369	you could
S0368	yes
S0369	couldn't you
S0368	yeah
S0369	mm
S0368	yeah
S0369	mm and actually just look at the leave from here
S0252	yes
S0369	to
S0252	yes
S0369	could be quicker by train than by aeroplane
S0252	yes
S0369	bear in mind the wait time
S0252	yes
S0369	et cetera and where the
S0252	mm
S0369	where you land
S0252	yes
S0369	from from your wherever you want to be whereas er there could still be a bite of a torturous journey from there to
S0252	yes
S0369	to whereas by train it would be nearer wouldn't it
S0252	yes
S0369	see the thing about the train be it land you in the centre of
S0251	mm
S0369	paris or
S0251	mm
S0369	barcelona or somewhere or
S0251	mm
S0369	even
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	without
S0251	mm
S0369	go too too far away
S0251	yes
S0252	i think i'm hop in the future with the few new high speed line in central europe and er hopefully some will make use of the sort of lille europe hub with connections to eurostar to they certainly could get some good fast rail
S0369	mm
S0251	yeah
S0252	in the future
S0369	mm
S0251	yeah yeah
S0252	yes
S0369	we have be to lille haven't we

S0369	yes
S0252	but the other side seem to have start off now
S0369	oh i see
S0252	yeah it's not as bad as it use to be but when there's a bite better weather i'll do the same thing and
S0369	yeah the same again that's it
S0252	but the good thing be that side look as though it's sort i think i've do it
S0369	mm
S0252	cos there be quite a bite of work to do on that side when you think that there be the curtain rail to do which be
S0369	yeah
S0252	no easy job
S0369	no no they're not be they curtain rail no yeah i've be deal with curtain rail this week as well
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	yes i've deal with curtain rail this week twice actually just i'm go to do a modification
S0252	you
S0251	oh
S0252	modification
S0252	modification yes
S0251	what's that
S0369	we're still have one rail
S0251	mm
S0252	uhu
S0369	and there be a central fasten
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0369	and it's the two rail go into that
S0251	yeah
S0369	i'm go to get another central bracket so we can just lap them like that a bite
S0252	mm
S0251	yeah
S0252	yes
S0369	mm
S0251	like when you have the string they're
S0368	mm
S0251	like that aren't they
S0368	mm
S0369	yes
S0251	so it cross over slightly
S0369	yeah or
S0368	mm
S0369	or by that bite
S0368	mm
S0251	mm
S0252	yeah i be so please that erm it could use the exist fittings
S0251	i know
S0368	mm
S0252	you know i didn't have to drill anything i er so
S0251	i think i felt sure
S0252	it's safe
S0251	we would
S0368	oh yes
S0251	but nothing ever be the right size
S0369	no
S0368	no
S0251	or compatible
S0369	because i believe that there would be like the plasterboard
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	and you would have to use er butterfly nut
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0368	and it make a big hole doesn't it
S0369	be you with me on butterfly nut have i show you butterfly nut
S0368	yes
S0252	they're like a little plastic then that kind of
S0251	do you mean rawlplugs that's rawlplugs on here
S0369	that's a a butterfly nut be it's get two legs and it's fasten with a spring and you close them in
S0252	uhu
S0369	and there's a a longish ball go through and you screw it through which mean you've get to put the bolt through first
S0252	uhu
S0369	through what you're go to fasten and then screw the butterfly on just to start it
S0252	mm
S0369	and you need a hole big enough big enough when it's close up to go in so it would just be this elongate
S0252	yeah
S0369	you put it in and let it go and it open up and you can now screw away to your heart's content
S0252	mm
S0369	because you only use it once because when you wanna do it
S0252	mm
S0369	that drop not that it matter cos you just get another one and do the same again to put back
S0252	yes
S0369	but i shall have to er
S0251	demonstrate
S0369	i'll bring to couple to show you
S0252	yes
S0369	er but for er
S0251	curtain rail
S0369	well really
S0251	i hate curtain rail
S0369	for er plasterboard fasten
S0251	mm flimsy wall
S0369	mm i mean don't forget the plasterboard be on wood as well
S0251	mm
S0369	so if you be lucky and you hit the wood
S0251	yes it would be better wouldn't it
S0369	yeah you could have a screw in but that rarely happen do it
S0251	mainly you don't
S0252	mm
S0369	it would just be an inch out or something or or
S0252	i must say get this now a an aluminium curtain rail rather than a a plastic one
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0251	should be a bite stronger shouldn't it
S0368	yes
S0369	that's it
S0251	yeah
S0369	mm well there's some wonderful fix and tool that out now isn't there
S0252	there's
S0251	mm
S0369	really
S0252	some
S0369	fix
S0252	fittings
S0369	really good fix
S0252	yes
S0369	you know to like these mind you these butterfly nut be ancient really
S0252	mm mm yes i prefer to do as little diy as possible
S0252	i do quite well to be honest but
S0251	do some good job haven't you
S0252	yeah
S0251	mm
S0369	well i like those er this screwdriver set that much that when i get home and weigh it up
S0251	no you want a
S0369	i be go to get one
S0251	mm
S0369	yes i'm go to get one
S0368	yes
S0252	what i be think of do be er i've get a little tray in the garage and i'm think of put all the essential tool in there and keep that in the house and attempt to
S0369	mm
S0252	er sort of make it easier to to to sort of get hold of
S0369	i know
S0252	tool
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	i mean by the way if you read the back of that card
S0252	yes
S0369	there's a magnet there as well
S0252	a magnet
S0369	yes and i think it's you know when you're cut the bits off and that
S0252	yes
S0369	er you know and you can put them on so you don't lose it
S0251	mm
S0252	yeah
S0369	or it get mix
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0369	you see so you just have to watch
S0251	you kind of do with a little tin to put them in
S0369	mm
S0251	otherwise they'll be all over the
S0368	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	well actually i say really if i have time i'd knock a box up you know a wooden box
S0252	uhu
S0369	and
S0252	yeah
S0369	and to lay them in there because the big danger be you get them all mix up
S0252	mm
S0369	i mean
S0251	with what other bits or within that set
S0252	well you might put
S0369	in within that set as well
S0251	oh right
S0369	and any others anyhow mm
S0252	a t twenty screw in the t twenty five
S0251	slot
S0368	mm
S0252	slot and then
S0368	mm
S0251	oh how can you
S0252	use it to
S0251	get it to stay on the thing
S0369	mm
S0368	i don't know
S0252	well it might do or you may need to get
S0369	i think i think they be in a little clip actually
S0252	yes
S0369	of course they're still in that bubble pack
S0251	yeah
S0369	but when i go into er as mum call it
S0369	the correct name be
S0251	yeah
S0368	mm
S0369	er there be er er these two like and and another so i say i'll tell you what i'm after and i say haven't hear of it have you a t twenty screwdriver it i'm call it that
S0251	mm
S0369	say yes i say no well i've hear of phillips
S0251	mm
S0369	and pozidrive and slot but t twenty and the other bloke say i have he say and he say i think they're do it on purpose so as you can't do things
S0251	yeah
S0369	because you need these
S0251	it
S0369	you
S0251	yeah
S0369	you know bits and piece
S0251	mm
S0369	like and that and so the other one say right follow me and away we go round up and there there they be like and it's there t i say that's it t twenty and it's in the pack so i take it and it's get a screwdriver as well
S0368	have they
S0369	and i don't know whether the screwdriver's a ratchet as well i think it say it be a ratchet
S0252	i would suspect
S0251	mm
S0252	it be yes
S0369	mm and then when i look at it it there be a magnet in there cos it say forty four piece
S0252	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	and i count up i think you count as well didn't you
S0368	mm
S0369	anyway and say there isn't forty well i say there's the the screwdriver
S0251	mm
S0369	itself i say that's another one like and i'm well i say there's some in the handle as well there
S0252	mm
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	i say another i don't know must be about five or six there and then it say magnets
S0251	mm
S0369	don't forget magnets keep away from laptops and
S0251	telephone and things yeah
S0369	computers and er even maybe mobile phone and that magnets and televisions now they don't go they're not compatible
S0251	mm
S0369	but er yes i think the magnet be to when you've get them out you know just put it on or if you're gonna pick them up ten of them put them in but it they get them back into but they may be mark
S0252	mm
S0251	they might be
S0369	may be mark
S0251	engrave on the side
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0251	so you can see
S0369	mm
S0251	which be
S0369	i don't know but of course when you look at the end you can well these t ones you can't mistake those so they they will be alright
S0251	mm
S0369	they're to keep together and i think the phillips and the cross like the cross one it's just a flat one ordinary
S0251	mm
S0369	down there and there's the the pozidrive well the pozidrive and the phillips they're similar but you'd soon find out
S0251	mm
S0369	yeah

S0369	absolutely mm
S0251	in your sew box et cetera or
S0369	mm mm
S0251	little

S0369	it's surprise how these things take off and
S0251	maybe
S0369	and develop you know
S0251	yes
S0369	mm
S0251	so
S0369	mm
S0251	i don't know
S0252	they be change gcses nearly every
S0251	oh
S0252	every year aren't they really
S0369	well
S0251	it's awful isn't it
S0369	every
S0368	yeah
S0369	er new education minister that come up start afresh don't they
S0251	something or other it's never still
S0369	mm
S0251	for long
S0369	and i be in at the begin with a
S0368	mm
S0369	i think i think they call him
S0251	that's right nineteen forty four
S0369	and he start mm
S0251	yeah
S0369	i don't know whether i'd leave school or not then don't forget i leave actually at thirteen you know
S0251	mm
S0369	i start work at fourteen and one week and because my birthday as you know january the tenth be in the christmas holiday that's it so when i leave school before christmas i be still thirteen and eleven months or something so start then and then from then on everyone that come be change it all for the better
S0251	mm
S0369	but as it go on they find out oh there's a lot of problems in this one oh and
S0251	mm
S0369	away they go again there's no end to it
S0251	it'll never be right
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0368	well i think yours be one of the biggest erm sort of mix up you know when they go comprehensive
S0251	oh yeah
S0368	that be a very big change wasn't it
S0251	yeah get a lot for the summer i get about fifteen thousand
S0368	mm
S0251	over the summer yeah
S0252	i do also get an email which erm to say that they're change the system a bite
S0251	which system the mark
S0252	the epen system
S0251	the epen
S0252	yes
S0251	oh really
S0252	really
S0251	in what way
S0369	what be that
S0252	well there's the platform that you mark on the computer be go to need some additional system requirements
S0369	oh
S0251	mm
S0369	uhu
S0368	that be before they start it
S0251	you mean technical requirements of the computer
S0252	big change yes
S0251	to what now
S0252	erm i don't think it
S0251	will we still meet everything
S0252	i i think so well
S0251	mm
S0252	we've get sort of two computers
S0251	mm
S0252	well even three computers and they're all a slightly different
S0251	yeah set up
S0252	set up which
S0251	mm
S0252	i'd be very surprise well it
S0251	mm
S0252	wouldn't work if all three of ours didn't work because
S0369	mm
S0251	yeah
S0252	it would only leave a very small number of computers
S0251	i usually just leave the dell set up
S0252	yes
S0369	mm
S0251	for that and then i don't
S0369	yeah
S0251	have to
S0369	that's it
S0251	tinker about with it
S0369	mm
S0251	so that
S0369	still go strong be it
S0251	and make it a bite easier
S0369	touch wood oh oh dear
S0252	but you be able to do it on my laptop which
S0251	i know
S0252	technically it wasn't suppose to work on there but
S0369	mm
S0251	we get it go didn't we
S0252	yes
S0368	mm
S0251	or you do rather i didn't
S0368	yeah that's er that might be a little bite
S0251	mm
S0368	towards your yeah that's good cos you don't get much erm school work now do you
S0251	no mm feel better do mark though really
S0368	mm
S0251	quieter
S0252	it's very er maybe isn't it
S0368	yeah it's
S0251	mm
S0368	yeah
S0369	that won't be wireless though will it that won't be wireless
S0251	the dell
S0252	erm
S0369	the dell
S0252	we're we be no the dell isn't wireless
S0369	you just do your
S0252	we can do it though it's
S0369	your most er and that
S0252	it's
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0252	but when we do it on the laptop that be with wi fi
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	i think they prefer you not to use wi fi because it do require quite a bite of sort of data energy from the the wireless system and generally it would have to be a ninety percent strength which be maybe
S0251	yes
S0252	just a little bite of a high expectation
S0251	yeah
S0252	in real life it doesn't need to be ninety percent but
S0251	and we be in real life really
S0252	yes
S0251	aren't we
S0369	yes we do real life yeah
S0252	it would manage with less it's just it might be
S0368	mm
S0252	a little bite sluggish
S0368	mm
S0252	but it it's amaze to think we do have the fastest broadband we possibly can and
S0251	mm
S0368	you do it what you mean through through your computers or through the airwaves
S0252	erm well erm
S0368	oh
S0252	obviously it come through there which be we have a a fibre optic unlimited broadband plan so it's it's the most advance
S0369	be you on fibre optics here then
S0252	yes
S0369	mm
S0252	a plan
S0368	oh right mind you where wherever we see seem to go whether it's a library or erm
S0251	a bank
S0368	where wherever the bank they always say it's a bite slow you know we'll have to wait
S0369	mm it's slow today
S0251	yeah
S0369	it's slow today mm
S0251	mm
S0252	i think be just a little bite
S0368	behind the time you be gonna say
S0369	backward be the word you're look for
S0252	it's kind of off the map a little bite in regard to internet i think
S0368	i be it off the map
S0369	you mean be it something like that you know
S0369	they what they call them
S0251	neanderthal
S0369	there's or something
S0251	yeah
S0369	we're not mondado mondeo man yet be we
S0251	mm
S0369	but we're gonna be the i don't know how this be gonna work
S0252	mm i wonder er on the television it be say that virgin media be plan to lay a lot of fibre optic cable around the country
S0251	oh be they
S0252	i wonder if they'll er move into
S0369	us
S0252	yeah
S0368	oh no
S0369	yeah
S0369	they won't know where it be
S0369	yes and
S0368	it won't be on their map
S0369	no
S0252	one thing i say i saw that be a a bite of a problem for other operators be that the wire be a different er width compare to the rest of the country in
S0369	us
S0252	yes
S0369	ah they will be yes yes
S0368	like the railways wouldn't it
S0369	like that railway
S0368	yeah
S0369	between grantham and newark it's just that bite
S0369	in that bite that's it that's do it i've pull the plug pull the plug on them mm
S0368	and yet we've get our own telephone and erm
S0251	yeah
S0368	you know
S0368	all get and that
S0369	mm mm
S0368	erm you'd think it would be
S0369	mm
S0368	top notch wouldn't you really
S0369	yes
S0251	mm
S0368	but it's not
S0252	different size wire in
S0251	mm
S0252	compare to the rest of the country
S0369	mm
S0252	and crucially more expensive to install wire
S0369	oh it get
S0368	oh
S0369	from bad to worse doesn't it oh just when you think it can't get any worse we get to
S0251	mm
S0368	yeah
S0369	then it do
S0251	it's a special case
S0368	so really they really need to replace them all do they
S0252	to replace
S0368	all the wire
S0252	well
S0368	to be in
S0252	the
S0368	line with everybody else
S0252	they would just the options would be that you'd they it would be just unreasonable to directly just have to really stick with those wire it's really a a decision's be make by presumably to make the wire different in an attempt to put off other company
S0369	mm
S0252	because obviously
S0368	yeah
S0252	you'd have additional expense for compatibility
S0368	mm
S0369	yes that's it that's
S0251	so you're hold to ransom in other word
S0368	mm
S0369	mm
S0368	yeah
S0369	yes that's the sort of trick they would pull and think that be smart that be smart
S0252	really what they should have do or there should have be a requirement that all the wire have to be the same specification for that country
S0368	just
S0251	right okay
S0368	you would have think that would have be the case wouldn't you
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0368	mm well i think if people have a choice of them would leave wouldn't they
S0369	well mm i think so mm
S0368	they'll go onto bt and
S0369	mm
S0368	virgin or whatever
S0369	but i know actually the fibre optic business have come into because it it's come come through
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0369	er i've be in there
S0251	mm it's hollow in yes
S0369	and of course there be a lot of there and there's hole and that cut all over you know for wire and pip come through it it's not just the bridge
S0251	no it's not empty no
S0369	no and come through and they've they've er you know it's over the other side and they they've come through and i don't know whether or not it's in so it's not that far away from us as such
S0368	no
S0251	no
S0369	the fibre glass
S0252	mm mm
S0251	mm
S0369	and i be only when we be the come i keep see these big long grey pole which seem to have a a wider end you know like that on the top er still tubular
S0252	about the height of a lamppost or
S0369	bite higher than that
S0252	yeah
S0369	mm and i i can i keep say i wonder what they're for and i be come today
S0368	mm yeah
S0369	there be
S0252	mm
S0369	two more up
S0368	yes
S0369	come out at isn't there
S0368	yes
S0369	and i say look there's two more there and i think they're something to do with the mobile
S0252	yes
S0369	telephone
S0252	mobile phone masts
S0369	yes
S0252	there be a a few in this area
S0368	be there
S0252	and like like that be they grey
S0369	yes
S0252	oh yes
S0369	mm but to me mobile phone masts you see them er maybe in field or we see some just outside er paignton there er they're in the wood but they've get all they
S0251	yeah they're try to disguise them as tree
S0369	yes there's all sort of
S0252	mm
S0369	like er dish on them and that
S0251	mm
S0369	which to me that's a mobile phone mast
S0251	mm
S0369	but they really didn't
S0252	but i suspect it might not be as powerful as that but
S0369	mm
S0252	maybe there's a little weak spot
S0369	mm
S0252	with a a poor connection in that point so
S0368	oh yeah
S0252	they put er
S0369	mm
S0252	one that integrate
S0369	yes
S0252	a bite better
S0369	mm
S0252	erm in an attempt to boost the signal
S0369	but the but there's they're pop up all over aren't they now
S0251	mm
S0252	mm well there's one in which cause a massive controversy
S0368	oh do it
S0369	oh that one they have to measure
S0252	yes
S0369	ah mm
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	have it be deal with now then
S0252	yes i think that
S0369	mm
S0252	case have be put to sleep now
S0369	uhu and be the mast up
S0252	yes it's still there
S0369	how come
S0252	now the big thing in now be fracking because
S0369	yes
S0368	oh yes
S0252	he say oh i propose to do it about four miles away from so
S0251	oh right
S0369	mm
S0251	i think it's near at
S0252	yes
S0251	near
S0368	oh yeah
S0369	uhu
S0368	yeah
S0252	but it's not actually a district matter
S0368	oh
S0252	it's er a county matter but the district council be
S0368	mm
S0369	it's and er it er where do that pamphlet come from a pamphlet be give maybe in about that one out there you know at workington
S0368	yeah
S0369	and it say that fracking have be ban and it name i think three countries
S0368	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	i think germany be one
S0252	yes
S0369	where it's be ban no fracking in germany er
S0252	i think france be another one
S0369	two other place you know so you know they be but as i be say to grandma about a month ago in lincolnshire
S0252	mm
S0369	there be er an earthquake
S0252	yes
S0369	and it be actually for this country it be fairly big
S0252	mm
S0369	it be something like three point four or something
S0252	on the richter scale yeah
S0369	mm now then er in lancashire er they be do some fracking there
S0252	mm
S0369	somewhere blackpool way and there be two earthquakes
S0252	yes
S0369	and they be attribute to the fracking
S0252	mm
S0369	so that's now then there's this one in lincolnshire and i say three point four for this country be be er get on the big side for us and of course it's not that far away from and just across and you're there er so you know it's all like er er you know grist to the mill like isn't it
S0251	mm
S0369	to say that er yes there be something in that business but you see at they're say we're not er er do it they're just test but the they're test really for continue
S0251	mm
S0369	to do it aren't they they're not
S0251	no well
S0369	test it for nothing
S0251	test yeah
S0369	what be they test for
S0251	mm
S0368	well the people have be er and all sort
S0369	mm
S0368	of things and in fact the police er
S0369	mm
S0368	come and
S0369	well they've be and
S0368	knock them down
S0369	knock all the tent down and
S0368	but they've be there
S0369	all that business and
S0368	you know overnight
S0369	they're still there
S0368	when people be stay there be there for a few weeks haven't they
S0369	mm well they've be there age
S0368	yeah
S0369	mm but to me when it come to this electricity business i'm sure will collect correct me if i'm wrong but i think france the majority of france's electricity and we buy some of their electricity over here be from nuclear
S0251	mm
S0369	be that right
S0252	mm yeah it's practical
S0369	mm
S0368	but we don't we don't want it do we
S0369	we
S0252	well it's there be some nuclear plant in this country i
S0368	be there
S0252	i think it's approximately
S0368	oh
S0252	twelve to fifteen percent
S0369	mm
S0252	be nuclear
S0368	oh be it
S0252	of our energy
S0368	i didn't think we have any oh right
S0369	and don't forget you've both be in one haven't you
S0251	dungeness
S0369	dungeness
S0368	yes
S0369	mm and they start off on this tour we do and they say anyone who have a breakfast of bacon and egg this morning it be fry on nuclear power electricity
S0369	and er that be a really good stab at so you've have the benefit of nuclear power on your bacon and egg
S0252	mm mm
S0369	but what they're go to do and go to be er you know smaller nuclear station er power station all round and as i say er i know even in this atom bomb business i've be read with er with er churchill and go through they're on about fission and fusion
S0251	mm
S0369	and i think the bomb be er
S0368	fusion
S0369	be fusion
S0251	mm
S0369	and anyhow that's the thing with the and it's get you see it's get that bad reputation which it deserve
S0251	yeah
S0369	but there be another form of atomic power which be the as i say the fission er i think it's fission which doesn't have this these dangers
S0251	mm
S0369	but it's a little bite more difficult
S0251	mm
S0369	the they do it they can do it in a laboratory you know experimentally to demonstrate it but get it to be up and run
S0251	mm
S0369	to put it into production for electricity be er just but it will come it will they will get it that way mm because electricity it's so we're dependent on it
S0251	mm
S0369	all over aren't we we can't do without it now
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	and when er faraday michael faraday
S0251	mm
S0369	first do it british er first do it and they take the prime minister i don't know who it be the prime minister er asquith or somebody to show him to demonstrate
S0251	mm
S0369	it and that and he look at it and light this bulb and that you know
S0251	mm
S0252	uhu
S0369	so he say well what good will be be
S0251	mm
S0369	you know what good will it be this thing and faraday say well one day you'll be able to tax it
S0251	mm
S0369	pat and he say
S0251	mm
S0369	carry on carry on
S0251	mm
S0369	and look and we're so dependent on it aren't we
S0251	mm
S0369	our railways now er the go to have it electric aren't they
S0251	that's right
S0369	which mean we'll call off the coal
S0252	mm
S0369	and actually even in margaret thatcher's well even when they be make this bomb you're talk about wartime they realise then er that er coal be really outdated
S0251	mm
S0369	you that that's why it it go out of favour cos we decide that that coal be just far too expensive and and one way or another er to be continue with coal mean really for the railways
S0251	mm
S0369	cos it's so important have railways like communications so they go to diesel
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	now they're out
S0251	mm
S0369	go to electric
S0252	mm
S0369	and there's be a big er conference on and one thing and another to get it electrify from to but the way they've get it on the map it's stop at didn't come through to but anyhow i think they've more or less get it through to come to now
S0251	mm
S0369	electric
S0368	mm
S0369	so electricity be the be the key isn't it and when you think when you go back and you look at the sistine chapel which you have do and you see that er adam reach out
S0251	mm
S0369	to god
S0251	mm
S0369	in between them
S0251	mm
S0369	that electric spark
S0251	mm
S0369	make you think doesn't it
S0369	mm
S0369	ten to three mum
S0368	uhu
S0369	just have a time check anyhow it's to see you both look well actually
S0251	yeah
S0252	uhu
S0251	yeah
S0369	and i think you look really smart i must say
S0251	mm
S0252	thank you very much
S0369	yes very good
S0251	mm the bits at the end
S0369	so next time i come i might bring my
S0368	mm
S0369	the kodak printer
S0252	yes
S0251	get it flush out
S0368	mm
S0369	and i shall write it down
S0251	take note this time
S0369	note will be take
S0369	mum be say the other day about that erm
S0368	dvd dvd
S0369	no not the dvd when she when she go to school and we get her that er
S0251	the tape recorder cassette
S0369	no not tape recorder
S0251	cassette
S0369	the
S0368	computer no
S0251	calculator
S0369	can't remember
S0251	calculator
S0369	oh a calculator the scientific one the scientific
S0251	oh yeah
S0369	cos you have a calculator which be ordinary
S0251	mm
S0369	which we think that be
S0251	mm
S0369	the eighth wonder of the world didn't we
S0368	yeah
S0251	mm
S0369	eighth wonder of the world a calculator mm and then come the scientific one and it do square root and i don't know what
S0252	mm
S0369	do everything but make a sandwich
S0251	mm
S0369	when you have this one and we wonder where it be all go to end then but
S0251	mm
S0368	well
S0369	yeah
S0252	well
S0369	which
S0252	suppose it's graphical calculator
S0251	mm
S0369	i want it though
S0252	the graphical calculator
S0369	graphical
S0251	mm
S0369	well what be on it the other night and it show you this be it swatch or something
S0368	mm
S0369	and he say oh look that's what or be on about
S0251	mm
S0369	now look that business and it tell you all sort of things on that
S0251	mm
S0368	on that watch
S0369	mm
S0368	what do they call what do they call it
S0252	a graphical calculator
S0251	no the iwatch
S0369	the the little
S0252	oh the iwatch
S0369	in
S0368	iwatch
S0369	this business you know
S0368	yeah
S0369	it's get everything cos grandma say well you'll need a magnify glass that big so as you can see it on there if it's like that
S0251	i wouldn't be able to see it
S0368	well if there's print on it you know it
S0251	i wouldn't be be able to see it
S0368	would be so tiny wouldn't it
S0369	mm
S0251	how they i don't know
S0368	mind you some of the
S0252	it's
S0368	watch now the men's watch be absolutely massive aren't they
S0251	yes like
S0369	mm
S0368	yeah yeah
S0251	cos you can get
S0369	mm
S0251	yeah
S0368	no i think you mean when we have the erm recorder thing under there
S0369	tape recorder
S0368	the tape recorder
S0369	mm
S0368	i could never do it
S0369	yes
