S0200	yeah
S0187	three hundred and fifty million viewers
S0387	i saw that thirty different countries
S0200	and then what be it fifty million pound a year for the bbc bear in mind they don't advertise so
S0187	mm
S0200	that's a lot of money although i saw we have a tv licence letter downstairs
S0187	oh really have we
S0387	have
S0187	say it say it expire the other day
S0200	yeah so i don't know what we do with that
S0387	as long as we don't watch live tv we're good
S0187	it's always tv's always on downstairs
S0200	be it
S0187	yes
S0200	i don't fuck watch it
S0387	but generally we we only watch netflix so and and sky on demand
S0200	yeah you
S0387	you do
S0200	but it on the other side of the coin though it be only twenty quid
S0387	twenty quid
S0200	between us for the year
S0387	i'm not get it this year
S0187	yeah but what's the point in pay it for i watch it i wouldn't it wouldn't be a loss to my life if i stop watch it but
S0200	yeah
S0387	from now until september
S0200	but the other thing be they don't know the only thing be be that the live room tv be connect to an aerial and if they come in they'll go you've obviously be watch tv
S0187	mm
S0200	so that's
S0187	you're allow to you're allow to tell them no once aren't you and then if they come back with a warrant
S0387	yeah cos i say no last year and then we pay it
S0200	yeah we pay it before he come back round
S0187	yeah
S0200	but you can stream and stuff but you can just put the laptop on or an xbox or whatever
S0187	yeah you see i think watch be just the ease of i i've get my dinner i put it on the table and i eat like watch tv but
S0387	eat we eat in here generally don't we pretty much
S0187	yeah i like eat either either in the kitchen or in there
S0387	i i never watch live tv
S0200	yeah you don't need it if you stream like bbc iplayer or
S0187	mm a lot of the time i think though 's get it on like he'll be in there and have it in the background while he's do something or whatever and it'll be on i'll come in and sit with him and just watch whatever shit's on tv i like have it but i'm not really arsed
S0387	i sit and watch i sit while we've be watch on demand i miss live tv i like to flip through the channel
S0187	mm
S0387	sometimes you you watch stuff you wouldn't normally watch
S0187	yeah i think when i just end up stream everything or like net if we're on netflix or whatever there's there's an odd feel about it like it's just unlimited like i could just be sit here all day whereas yeah i don't feel like that with tv
S0200	yeah it's too much it's too much really
S0387	i be read on erm ten ways recently erm if you've get sky broadband if you ring them up and say you wanna cancel

S0187	mm
S0200	and i've be back a a week tomorrow i think but
S0387	have be shout a lot recently i've hear
S0187	he's always fuck shout
S0200	he just need to get on with it like
S0187	just move the shower out the way and
S0200	yeah exactly
S0187	wait

S0187	mm
S0200	have a nice hot shower
S0187	mm
S0387	mm i think i tell you in erm before i come to uni i have my gap year have a house and her shower like it be ice cold and it have its own generator it would as it would make a noise to generate heat but it'd be pure hot so it would literally be in like maybe ten second every sixty that you'd have to jump in and jump back out
S0187	so shit yeah
S0200	where be that
S0387	huh
S0200	where be that
S0387	don't know where it be it be in a block of flats

S0200	we the shower generate its own hot water
S0187	mm
S0200	you can flush the toilet you can you can run a million tap in the house it never make a difference
S0387	the worst thing they have for a year be over christmas when everyone go home and i be here for work and have turn off the heat when i be out so i get up for work there be no cold water so i have to i have like five pan on the stave have the kettle go try to fill up a bath
S0187	yeah it's not it's not great to be honest i think we we have we've get it at home where because of the farm like dad get the water sort out i think but we've get an electric shower because of the farm sometimes like if they're power wash or something we just get horrendous water pressure so
S0200	oh like a dribble
S0187	so yeah it come out a dribble and it's really hot and it'll go stronger if you put it round down to the cold but yeah it's
S0387	and when the pressure be right it's freeze cold
S0187	yeah it's fuck minging but he's get it sort now cos but if if they be power wash we're still still fuck
S0200	i i the worst i have here be the downstairs toilet wouldn't stop flush
