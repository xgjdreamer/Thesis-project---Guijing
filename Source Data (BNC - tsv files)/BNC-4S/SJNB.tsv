S0123	make you angry
S0050	yeah the the think of have to do another thing for church make me really angry and i think that maybe i need to sort out my heart and i need to pray about it before i could do it
S0123	good one
S0123	i be gonna say i be a little bite worry there that you
S0123	like the content of it make you angry the gospel damn it
S0050	no
S0109	do you say this tongue in cheek or do you say this genuinely
S0050	er i say that it make me angry er it really do make me angry it still be make me angry
S0109	yeah
S0123	why
S0050	so um because er i'm feed up i can't do any more church things in my week it's ridiculous i don't ever see anyone else i don't ever do anything else
S0123	mm
S0050	like i get into school and i er like my partner teacher will be like oh like so what do you do last night church
S0050	what do you do last night church what do you do oh yeah i be at church last night yeah i be at home group last night yeah i be at prayer yeah and it's ridiculous
S0123	mm
S0109	yeah
S0050	um i've get to spend some time with people who be not christians
S0034	yeah
S0123	you you guy work a bite harder because you you've get your home group and you've get um pathfinders as well haven't you
S0034	yeah
S0109	yeah
S0050	and we've get then we've get plan as well
S0123	yeah so whereas twenty twenty you don't do any plan
S0123	and and it be your home group so lighter and
S0123	um well sure you know you plan bible study in advance but then that only involve one person and you don't have to think of entertain things for people to do they can just
S0109	do you send your bible study off to people to read through before you do them then
S0123	i generally do to um i should do it to the other leaders as well because sometimes you it's better to it might be nicer to have the other leaders actually know where i'm try to head with it
S0050	mm
S0123	um yeah so um yeah generally i send it to i use to send it to when i be do it
S0050	oh okay then
S0123	um because er you know it's just good to have another pair of eye over it
S0050	yeah
S0123	people just you could go i don't understand what that mean or
S0050	no
S0123	have you think about this very important vital part aspect that you've not address
S0050	yeah i think it's really helpful and i think it's i i really enjoy plan
S0123	mm
S0050	like i do think it's really good and i really i like meet up and i like plan and i like do pathfinders i just don't like that it mean that i can't do anything else
S0123	mm
S0050	and this week i just be i just couldn't i just couldn't do it
S0123	mm
S0050	and i just hadn't do anything so i just on sunday i be like i've not do anything i've not read it i've not do any prep
S0123	mm
S0050	and it make me angry i think he might he be like right we'll talk about it next half term
S0050	so i'm not completely out of it yet um i do see that it'd be useful
S0123	mm
S0050	i do know that i need to be train
S0109	but the thing be quite a lot of the stuff that they be say we already do as pathfinders
S0050	do we
S0109	yeah
S0050	okay
S0123	mm
S0109	i mean i don't i guess it's really really helpful for like new leaders in sunday club
S0123	mm
S0109	but ant and soph kind of cover quite a lot of what we've
S0123	yeah
S0050	what we do
S0109	what we do
S0123	so what kind of stuff do it contain
S0034	um
S0109	stuff about
S0034	i don't know well
S0109	focus on the bible
S0034	so yeah so the first session be all about the importance of the bible
S0123	okay that's like the standard
S0050	it be all about god
S0123	that's the standard evangelical start isn't it
S0050	er do he just say it's all about god
S0109	i don't know
S0050	the first session be all about god
S0034	the importance of the bible
S0050	okay
S0123	every every time you start something like in twenty twenty or you know with the als it's always the authority of scripture focus on that
S0050	well
S0123	and then work from there so um what er what er what be it say about the importance of the bible be that it
S0034	it be say it be important
S0123	mm er that's good
S0034	yeah
S0109	it steve be sort of expand on that on say that it's important to er apply it to your context er but then that didn't i don't know
S0123	do they be you um
S0109	didn't really go into it
S0123	wheel out the old um timothy the um you know scripture be good
S0034	well yeah obviously but but
S0123	everyone always wheel that no one ever wheel out you study
S0034	no
S0123	the scriptures for by them you hope to have eternal life but you refuse to come to everyone er everyone do the the er the pro and not the against
S0034	oh right yeah well we have a bite of a discussion on that
S0123	yeah
S0034	yeah there there so you get get a whole load of stuff you have to read and
S0123	mm
S0034	and and so there's like a a few paragraph you know there's like so there's like a little question so there's
S0123	mm
S0034	you know that you kind of show that well what what what and the answer to that question be the next few paragraph so if you read ahead you can basically
S0123	cheat
S0034	kind of
S0123	well
S0034	but then it's also sort of reflective stuff but then you have to but those question will say things like read act one to five
S0109	yeah pretty casually
S0034	compare act the compare the servant in act one five seven and ten and you're like oh
S0123	oh man that suck
S0109	it's just
S0034	read psalm seventy eight
S0109	that's after you've read the first psalm and you think you be really good for get through that in detail
S0109	and write lot of note on it and and then
S0123	oh
S0109	you're like oh
S0034	so it's quite chunky
S0123	but yeah i mean i guess the even if you go through it at a quite a er shallow level it's just read something take time
S0034	yeah
S0123	no that sound
S0050	have you meet up with anyone to do it cos i know that um and i think meet up with
S0034	yeah they say to her cos i cos you know i i say well the first um like assignment be plan a session
S0123	mm
S0034	on this and i be like well i wouldn't do it on my own
S0123	mm
S0034	and actually we also say beforehand that it mean you know it answer those question by yourself you're just like i don't get it or like you you think some obvious things and then it doesn't really do anything it kind of make sense to meet up and they say yeah er probably a good idea
S0109	yes but the thing be the only time i find to do it be on a saturday morning in bed
S0034	yeah
S0109	or over dinner or
S0050	yeah
S0109	things like that
S0050	exactly exactly
S0109	you know i er i can't spend another even
S0034	yeah
S0034	cos then you have to plan book another even don't you
S0109	yeah
S0034	and then it's
S0050	i know
S0034	uh
S0050	it be mental
S0034	but it isn't i mean if it's the be it one every half term
S0109	yeah
S0123	oh be it just one one one of these things that you
S0034	so it's not like it isn't
S0123	it's spread out
S0034	massive massive in term of time
S0109	no but this be a particularly busy half er term i think
S0123	yeah
S0109	no actually they're all busy
S0050	they're all busy
S0109	what be we talk about
S0050	i think i think it's just another er for me it's just another thing
S0123	mm
S0050	um
S0109	and it's another thing er at a time when you feel probably if you're anything like me that
S0123	mm
S0109	church should actually be help you say no to things by not offer you more things and certainly not by tell you you ought to be do
S0050	yeah well we weren't really offer it be we we be i felt awful when i speak to like i basically
S0034	we be basically tell yeah
S0109	yeah
S0050	yeah we be tell we have to do it didn't weren't we
S0109	yeah
S0050	and
S0123	wow the thing be like you guy be all have be do this for a while for the experience so
S0034	that's but they're they're make it compulsory for new leaders but it wasn't actually compulsory for us
S0123	oh okay
S0034	although they kind you know there be that kind of assumption that we would do it
S0109	i e say well i'm gonna sign you up for it if you really don't want to do it then come and tell me
S0123	okay
S0050	yeah it be really funny when he announce it like there be a real silence around the table
S0050	i felt a bite like oh i felt like we should be positive
S0123	mm
S0109	well
S0050	um
S0109	the trouble be if you announce it on a friday night at like half ten
S0109	when everyone's just want to go to bed
S0123	mm
S0109	you're not gonna get a positive response be you
S0050	yeah
S0123	i kind of feel though that new leaders
S0123	new leaders should be ship into twenty twenty and then we should be move leaders on from twenty twenty into other things rather than cos if you think about it lead twenty twenty be probably the easiest thing you could do because you're you're lead your peer you're just um
S0109	but it won't help you in any way for for lead for children's work cos it's just so different
S0123	um i think in term of like i guess cos with all this like the stuff you've just be do there the your knowledge of scripture and this kind of and that kind of stuff twenty the lead twenty twenty do equip you with and of course you know be able to study a passage look at it and then try and you know work out question and express i think it provide all the foundations you still have to build upon it but
S0109	but just do a bible study every so often in your home group would would manage that
S0123	mm
S0050	i i'm not i don't know what i think about pathfinder lead now cos i think it's quite hard and i think
S0109	mm
S0050	if you've just start come to church or you wanna get involve and you wanna get serve i think it would be a really hard place to to get serve like i think you're really well support
S0123	mm
S0050	but i think a lot of be be expect of you in term of be able to manage to lead group to manage behaviour to to stand up and do talk
S0123	mm
S0050	um
S0109	it's far more intimidate than say scramblers
S0050	yeah
S0109	scramblers for a start they don't care about coolness or anything like that
S0050	but no i the pathfinders be like
S0109	no they're a lovely lot don't get me wrong
S0050	yeah
S0109	but it's just that age group plus the fact that they're at that level when they're really spiritually start to engage
S0050	yeah
S0109	and you feel the responsibility
S0050	yeah
S0109	and you've get twice a week and plan and it's i i wouldn't ease somebody into serve through pathfinders
S0050	pathfinders no
S0123	mm
S0050	it's quite excite that 's gonna be do graft
S0109	it's quite sad that he's go to be do it as well
S0123	be he i didn't know about this
S0050	oh yeah he be
S0123	take over from
S0050	er so he's gonna be employ um by church next year to be do half admin and half run graft
S0034	really
S0050	yep
S0109	yeah
S0123	wow okay
S0034	i didn't know that that's cool so we lose him from pathfinders
S0050	but we lose him from and we lose him soon like we lose him
S0109	two weeks after half term i think be it

S0034	wow
S0123	which be pretty
S0050	that's very nice

S0034	ring them up and yep my sister's just make me cake
S0034	excellent
S0050	let's go now love it
S0123	yeah that be awesome that get me that get me um some point because er the er my sister's off to brazil soon so not the sister we meet fashion sister and um so there's a family get together next weekend um so i think pop home be gonna like little bite of a rescue thing rather than go sorry can't see my sister off go to wash some dish fifty kid that's it
S0123	so
S0034	what do that
S0123	she she's go by herself to brazil stupid thing and it's like literally i'm gonna go travel brazil on my own
S0034	really what do fashion sister make of non fashion sister
S0123	er they're like polar opposites
S0123	really i mean see my well actually no you see my i think they're both very proud of each other in term of what they do um but they be totally different so my er er eldest little sister be very
S0050	so which one's that
S0123	er that's that's the one who be bake the cake but er um
S0034	she's your older sister
S0123	no she's my eldest little sister
S0034	oh right yeah
S0123	cos i've get two little sisters so yeah yeah i i dunno they're just very different i mean like so when i go to visit in berlin fashion sister like could get to midnight and i'd be like i wanna go home or go to bed in the hotel and she'd be like what it's midnight come on let's go out drink er and then whereas like you know the my you know you go to berlin and she'll just she'll walk you round in you'll see all the tourist things and then at eight p m it'll be time to go to bed
S0050	really
S0123	you know but er she yeah very sort of different um thoughts of enjoy the world 's very independent so she be in new zealand monitor bird on islands inhabit by herself and some penguins and that be it
S0050	really
S0123	um and she
S0050	wow that's very isolate
S0123	she kind of can cope with that and be happy and whereas be always like in the middle of cities surround by lot of friends and um yeah
S0050	so how would you place yourself in and amongst them like
S0123	i think so my brother my little brother be a lot more so i guess i'm more like and 's more like
S0050	okay
S0123	um so bizarrely i probably tend towards the straight lace sensible side of the family um and then er luke would turn would tend towards the um go out night go you know party hard and that kind of stuff um er lifestyle er both i think both anna and luke be a lot more streetwise than either so they're um far happier um out and about
S0050	yeah oh that's quite brave though go to brazil on your own
S0123	yeah i think she's a bite
S0034	have she get anything to do or be she just go around
S0123	no she's do the big um both actually 's go over as well um a month later they're both gonna do the inca trail up to the big famous um mayan ruin or whatever in the jungle
S0109	presumably with a tour
S0123	oh yeah with a tour not by her not by her
S0109	yeah so she's not really er go on her own anyway
S0050	it's the it's the kind of thing though isn't it they'll they'll pitch up and she'll meet a whole load of randoms in a hostel
S0123	yeah
S0050	and she'll figure out who's go where and she'll probably tag along with quite a few of them
S0123	oh yeah
S0050	like you do meet a whole load of random people
S0034	mm
S0050	who be travel alone
S0123	yeah i'm pretty sure i mean and she's the kind of person who who would cope fine with that i think which obviously doesn't make my er parent very happy er
S0050	what be your parent like then be they quite
S0123	again er cos my dad be
S0034	they seem pretty cool to me
S0123	my dad be more like me um and so probably well probably even more like um yeah i dunno straight lace and then my mum's kinda massively i guess um yeah a bite more on the kind of wild side i guess well wild side's a bite wrong but um so my my dad my dad's quite happy be by himself and go ski and that kind of stuff um whereas my mum it's er you know she want to be at a party she want to um er have fun friends or go to a spa with her friends so yeah so yeah
S0050	families be weird aren't they i find families weird
S0123	i be read something interest er on the um resurgence um and it have have an interest comment not i haven't to my family but it be just an observation that say that every family be break you start off with a you know if you get marry and you have a family so you start off with a break family because everyone's flaw and everything um it's just a question of how quickly you realize it
S0109	oh what do you mean break
S0050	gosh that's quite sad so what's the what's the kind of
S0123	it be the
S0050	what the feel be that
S0123	well he
S0050	because it's break
S0123	well so he the guy be say he be sort of so he be so i so he say a lot of people say like oh my family be absolutely fine until my dad walk out or my um you know my marriage be really be great until i find out my wife be be unfaithful and there there's lot of these kind of um so people have like a big disaster in the family it just seem to be something you hear that they they blame the brokeness in the family on a particular event or a particular person make
S0050	yeah
S0123	a particular mistake and he say it's um probably what you need to realize be that the family be break all along you just couldn't see it um and you know
S0050	what and it just take an event
S0123	yeah and he say actually if you think about it
S0050	for you to realize it
S0123	you know you you kind of extend that there you have to assume that everyone's family be in some way break um and you have to be proactive to try and keep it together and to um you know help it survive so
S0109	well no family's gonna survive without work
S0123	no exactly
S0109	but that doesn't mean every family be break cos break imply something
S0050	i'm not sure about the word break
S0109	be er
S0123	well okay so the the the if i try a different analogy the um er guy who found pixar ed catmull um give an interview with the um er economist which be he where he i think he reveal himself to be a very wise man he say about pixar he say so you know that pixar make you know consistently great movies um but he say the thing i have to accept about pixar be that there be already something go wrong with it and i can't see it because i'm blind to it he say i accept that there be problems in the company that i just can't see that i er that that i have a blind spot for er um and then he he go on to talk about like you know ways in which he try you know he have to keep his hand on the rudder and this kind of stuff and i think that that that i think that's true for everything and every every relationship we have not just sort of the company that there be always things go wrong things be out out of balance things where the emphasis be on the wrong place um and you just have to accept that you know fundamentally we're all imperfect people um er and whenever you get more than one imperfect person in a place you've get trouble brew
S0050	hence why you never have a perfect church
S0123	yeah
S0050	and if you do then you must
S0123	completely not
S0050	leave cos you'll ruin it
S0123	mm the thing you think about a church you know you've get a bunch of people all go damn i'm screw i need a saviour turn up in the same build that's never gonna wind up nice
S0050	yeah
S0123	i be try to explain that to er my colleague who think that she be ask me whether i whether i think that maybe heaven might be the church now and i be like
S0109	have you be to a church
S0123	yeah exactly i mean it would be i could kind of see her point if you really idolize the church community and fail to see any of the problems with it then you could be like well maybe this be a manifestation of you know to some extent
S0034	it be
S0123	the embody christ it be but not in a final she be like say it in a sort of final this be it way so
S0034	mm yeah
S0050	i think always before i've be really annoy when i've when i've see non christians be really nice
S0123	really
S0050	and i i've be like a bite like oh er that's really annoy that they're nicer than me
S0123	mm
S0050	i should be nicer cos i'm a christian um i think it's a really good thing to realize that just cos you're a christian doesn't actually make you nice
S0123	mm
S0050	it just mean you recognize that you're not nice
S0050	um but i be think about even like yesterday like one of the other teachers from my school like i have to keep my class in cos they be be a pain in the backside they be be horrible but i be suppose to be on break duty and i walk out of my classroom um and um one of the year six teachers be there and he and i say to him i be like please can you just go and outside and cover my break duty cos i've gotta stay in with my class cos they're be horrible and he didn't bat an eye he just go yeah of course turn round get his coat and walk out and go and stand on duty if that have be me and someone have say that to me i'd have be like what really for the whole thing what so i don't get a cup of coffee what so i've gotta go out in the cold when it's icy and they're really annoy really
S0050	fine okay i'll do it fine fine yes fine yeah fine no like that would've be my reaction and i think that he
S0123	mm
S0050	he be so nice he just
S0109	but do you think he be think it or
S0050	dunno
S0109	or be he not the sort of guy
S0050	dunno
S0123	i i use to work with a guy like that he'd just he be i i keep think it would've be lovely if he'd um if he'd become a christian because er then there'd be like a christian who be genuinely nice
S0123	be like no he just really friendly and you know he's one of these people who who's just always enthusiastic to see you and always always please to see you
S0050	that's really nice
S0123	and just go oh yeah unfortunately um
S0050	that's very much like my housemate she's very much like that all the time
S0123	the one who need a man
S0050	yeah
S0123	a tall man let's not forget
S0109	which one
S0123	oh this be be record isn't it
S0050	yeah
S0050	oh no i wish i'd never bring that up she'd be so embarrass if she realize
S0109	oh
S0123	oh
S0109	j or e
S0050	i just think need to get marry i think need to get marry
S0109	i don't think i've meet her
S0050	do you've not meet
S0109	no
S0050	okay
S0123	oh
S0109	but if she do you'd have to mm you'd have to leave
S0050	i know that would be very sad so if she didn't get marry yet
S0050	especially not before i've rearrange the furniture
S0109	get any further on that
S0123	send send her off er
S0050	yeah i have she say to me yesterday she say er becca if we change it round for eight weeks we'd be able to move it back if we didn't like it wouldn't we and i be like yes
S0050	i be like we're on the way we're on the way to the change around of the furniture
S0034	what do you wanna do
S0050	so excite bean

S0050	and tell that i be gonna move her house round
S0050	um and she didn't really say anything but then the next day um she be speak to and she basically put her head in her hand and say to that i couldn't possibly do it and it be ridiculous and she write me a note say please don't move all the furniture
S0050	er which i felt very sad about so instead i do move a bite of furniture
S0050	um but only a little bite and i move it back um and i make a scale draw
S0050	of every single piece of furniture in the in the two room
S0050	and the scale draw of the two room um

S0123	oh dear
S0050	it's take me almost five years to realize
S0050	that's wrong with this but now i've realize it i'm not let go
S0050	that furniture will be move
S0123	oh can you just do the kind of thing of get some friends round to move it all in the middle of the night and then when when she wake up just pretend like
S0123	it's always be this way what be you talk about
S0050	what be you
S0050	you crazy woman

S0050	and that be a rubbish idea so you wouldn't wanna do that
S0123	oh my er my flatmate he's an trainee architect and he get so annoy at my house cos the kitchen's just design in a way that if you open any one door it seem to block every other door
S0123	in the kitchen from open so you can just if you open the oven it it block like at least two door two like you know things from open if you open the pull out the pan no one can enter the kitchen
S0050	oh that's quite annoy
S0123	if you open the fridge you're at risk of be bash by someone walk in it be a bite er
S0050	so hang on be you you're not still live in old house
S0123	oh yeah still still live in house so and it's kind of funny cos we'd just be we'd just be live with it like it be you know quite happily and then this he come in obviously be train in he's like argh why do it work see i do that again
S0050	you do do that you love that
S0034	i think that's
S0050	i've just realize that we shouldn't have come this way
S0034	be this the right way round

S0109	fifth and the sixth and stuff like that be around easter
S0050	yeah
S0109	april i don't know whether the i i have a feel it be the the first week of june but then i could be completely wrong
S0050	no you could be right um so i'm go to my tent exhibition next week also
S0034	a tent exhibition
S0050	yeah
S0123	what a a bold and excite life you live
S0050	can i just say it's really excite so we'll have none of that chat
S0034	so be that they basically have a load of manufacturers that go and have different tent and you go look at this tent
S0050	go to the yeah i go to the centre and there's gonna be load of tent and i'm gonna go in load of them
S0050	and it's gonna be really excite
S0109	you see that be excite
S0050	i think it's gonna be really excite
S0109	what's not excite be the tent when it's up
S0034	like maybe like hm
S0109	in the rain
S0050	oh right
S0034	this be this be a bite like the coleman's two thousand only they've get a zip over here instead of over there
S0050	no i'm gonna buy one it's not just look at them that'd be very bore but i'm go to go and buy one
S0034	ah
S0050	my plan be to buy a tent big enough for four or five people
S0034	oh yeah this be your grandma's money have she um
S0050	yeah
S0034	she hasn't veto the idea
S0050	well she kind of have but i've just ignore it
S0034	yeah
S0050	as have mum
S0034	la la la
S0050	in fact mum like keep on go and tell her 's spend your money on a tent 's spend your money on a tent
S0050	which drive her nut
S0050	um so anyway er
S0123	just tell tell her she need to give you enough money for a tent and furniture and then
S0050	and furniture i'll say oh come on grandma we can sort this out you just give me some more money um anyway
S0050	so er we need to go away in my tent
S0034	cool
S0050	let's go on holiday in my tent on a bank holiday weekend
S0109	it's bind to rain at the bank holiday weekend though
S0050	no it doesn't it hasn't do for the last like one year
S0123	well then the
S0050	last time i go away it didn't rain
S0123	well this this be 's cunning plan be to get a big tent so that you can stay inside
S0050	yeah that be the point the idea be that you sit inside
S0034	so what what size tent be you get
S0109	i think you pitch your tent near the pub
S0050	well yeah you could do that as well i find a really nice campsite
S0034	do you
S0050	on the norfolk coast
S0034	cool
S0050	so it's not very far away might be right quite breezy
S0034	so you're think a sort of six man
S0050	yeah well i
S0034	be that about the kind of size that you're think of
S0050	to be honest i'm kind of think about a four or five man er but i've get another
S0034	yeah
S0050	little tent as well so that could always come out for sleep arrangements
S0034	we've get one somewhere like quite a big one but it's kind of that sort of shape
S0123	i still wanna get the um
S0034	and then there's two end where you can get three people and like you get two really really comfy and the big bell bite which be sort of head height which be quite cool
S0050	so that's basically what i'm gonna get
S0123	mm
S0034	yeah like a six six
S0050	because i think that's what you need because when it rain you just wanna be able to
S0034	yeah
S0050	stand up somewhere inside you don't wanna be like
S0034	yeah
S0050	lie down eat your dinner
S0034	just buy a tent which be one of those ones where it's basically the size of your sleep bag
S0050	oh really
S0123	oh i use to have one of those they're terrible
S0123	well yeah it's like er you to you to wake up in the morning and the first thing you can do be like open the lid of the coffin
S0123	and just rise like dracula it's just the same and the problem be as well be no one expect them at a campsite so you're always you know i i think um
S0034	tread on
S0050	you're like you're the hardcore one if you're do that
S0034	mm
S0050	that's mental
S0123	i take i go to the end of the festival with one of those and unfortunately like a drink bust one of the pole while i be away so i then sleep the rest of the
S0123	the concert with er um the tent sort of press against my face it be horrible
S0109	but what do you when that like
S0050	you take those tent to um
S0123	mountains
S0050	to far away place mountains to nice hot sunny place don't you like you either use them because you're an extreme person do something extreme
S0123	mm
S0050	or you're
S0109	but you're not extreme enough to bivouac
S0050	to what
S0109	to bivouac
S0050	what's that
S0109	where you sleep you know sleep under the star
S0050	oh yeah yeah
S0050	well that'd be a bite intense but you would wanna have a tent if you be like
S0034	on mount everest
S0050	climb everest
S0034	yeah
S0050	oh i like that good think
S0034	like on a little ledge
S0050	pretty chilly without
S0034	you haven't get any space to pitch a six manner
S0050	yeah sit down inside
S0123	yeah no so
S0050	yep don't they have them pitch actually lot of them have them you just go and
S0109	yeah base camp and things for them
S0123	mm
S0050	you just walk up don't you and then throw yourself in an in a tent and then up you go again to the next set of tent um but yeah so anyway be anyone free
S0123	yeah i'm up for that
S0109	oh i'm free
S0050	you're up for it as well awesome love it so i think we should do the first bank holiday which be in may it might be a bite chillier
S0109	oo
S0050	but
S0034	oo if it's in may i'll be here
S0050	but it's er yeah it's a bite sooner that's um i'm quite excite i quite
S0050	want it to be quite soon
S0109	so that's may the seventh
S0034	let's have it in your garden
S0109	sixth fifth sixth seventh
S0050	yeah fifth sixth seventh
S0034	we could do it on a non weekend non bank er holiday weekend
S0034	let's let's have pathfinders in your back garden
S0050	in my back garden
S0034	in the tent
S0123	what's the actual what's the actual date for this
S0050	so the potential date be um whenever the bank holiday be at the begin of may
S0123	have that be move
S0050	i think it's the i think it's round the sixth or seventh
S0109	it's er monday's the seventh i think because i'm go to switzerland that week with work so
S0034	oo
S0109	it's easter
S0034	what be you do there
S0109	er teacher train
S0050	wow craziness
S0034	be that train a teacher or train to be a teacher
S0109	the we be
S0034	or what
S0109	have get someone who's train all the teachers that be go to pilot the book that we're work on at the moment
S0034	oh

S0123	yeah may the seventh
S0050	may the seventh there we go
S0034	may the seventh be with you
S0050	but i don't think the children be quite as interest
S0034	oh no that's the weekend of that um
S0109	no they're probably a bite young

S0050	yeah they be a bite little
S0050	er

S0050	i have to keep on go this be very interest children isn't it and like you could tell john jim be swing on his chair and just look keep on look at the clock and look really bore but anyway
S0109	maybe year eleven
S0050	yeah
S0109	er probably
S0123	i love the fact that you've get a kid call john jim just sound like he come out of the or something like his parent turn up um with a banjo chew grass
S0050	yeah bless him he's tut
S0050	i don't know how to describe him
S0050	he's a tricky little one
S0034	this whatever that be
S0050	my dad tell me that whenever he be drive round the m25 it always bend round in the direction that he be that it should do as in like when you're go round it
S0034	but it should do
S0050	like do you know what i mean
S0109	like it's always a big circle
S0034	this be bend clearly in the wrong direction
S0050	like it's always a big circle so it's always go right but just right now it's do not that
S0034	yeah
S0050	so that be a lie
S0109	maybe he close his eye for those bits
S0050	i think well that's dangerous
S0034	i'll do that at the next bite
S0123	or may maybe he be um confuse about his leave and his right cos like
S0123	consistently leave it be always in the right direction
S0034	be it down the m3 we're go
S0050	no no
S0034	m1

S0050	i've get massive bruise but yeah it wasn't
S0123	so what's the address we'll use the cheatingy modern technology thing

S0123	the place where we're go
S0050	i've no idea and this torch doesn't work
S0034	dunno
S0109	do
S0050	so that's a real shame do no one know where we're go
S0034	it's it's call or something
S0123	yeah
S0034	look i just need to know whether it's the m1 or the m3
S0123	oh i'll just put it in
S0034	i think it's er down the end of the m3
S0050	er you're not go down the m1 and you're not go down the m3 you're
S0034	where's the m3
S0050	you're gonna go down when you get to the m3 you'll be able to turn the other way
S0034	we're go the opposite way
S0050	yeah
S0034	yeah into london
S0050	yeah
S0034	but it's still the m3
S0050	oh be you
S0034	we need to go down to the very end of the m3 then it's
S0050	but the m3's not for age and age
S0034	come off at junction one and go right yeah but i just want to know
S0050	oh right
S0034	so that when i get there i i the m3
S0050	okay okay the m3's not yet this be the a1m this be where we should've come on
S0109	cos i'm confuse cos i think we be go in somewhere in the region of sort of because of the whole with them go to the
S0050	yeah we're we be a little bite
S0034	we be aren't we
S0109	yeah and um guildford's down the m dunno
S0034	go where
S0050	it so we're go the other way
S0109	okay
S0050	i think we're go quite a long way to get there to be honest but i don't remember
S0034	i think we're go the only way that make sense aren't we
S0109	we've get london
S0034	there's a map by one of your feet or
S0050	yeah i've get it on my knee
S0123	oh there's
S0050	but i can't see it i haven't get a torch
S0123	yes i've get the location here i just grab the postcode off the e mail
S0034	i have the correct location here
S0123	yeah
S0050	we're just we're just use 's just gonna find it for us on his
S0123	so basically you're just gonna take the to and then you turn off at for something which be
S0034	be it the m3
S0123	no you just stay on the m25
S0034	the m3 yeah
S0050	i get a beam
S0123	go away
S0123	no it isn't the m3
S0034	argh yeah it be
S0123	you you turn off at junction thirteen
S0034	no we're not
S0123	yes it be
S0034	we're go all the way down
S0123	and then you turn through and then yeah
S0034	it doesn't make any sense
S0123	why
S0050	tom can i have a look
S0123	yeah go on so i've only put i've only put the
S0050	cos i definitely agree with the m3 thing
S0123	i've only i've only do the postcode for the that's what google think so er argue with the
S0050	yeah this be quicker it cut the corner off so like you could go down the m3
S0123	but the m3 would be slower
S0050	but it's slightly slower
S0034	would it really be cos it's just bomb along the m25 and then go down the m3 whereas that's go through some wiggly a road isn't it a road
S0123	well it's a fairly straight roman
S0050	it's a fairly straight and what look like a dual carriageway l a road which cut off the corner
S0034	oh alright
S0034	but how else would how er other than that how else would you have do it
S0123	the m3 be the other alternative
S0034	you'd have go down the a1m wouldn't you huh
S0050	how do i get um wow hello
S0109	mm
S0050	i didn't wanna do that oo it's all go crazy it's turn upside down
S0123	what
S0050	um
S0123	oh you've do the er
S0050	i didn't mean to
S0123	pointy
S0050	what i mean to do be what do it say for junction option two of cos it's give you option one
S0123	oh okay yeah
S0050	you go to option two would it
S0123	um
S0050	do the m3 one
S0123	do route again and then i think option two be oh no it's get rid of it's get rid of option two
S0050	didn't like option two you see
S0123	well i think i think if we just we because we just pass the um turn for it miss the turn so but er presumably it would've be down through the dunno
S0050	i'm try to remember who i get a lift down with last time i can't remember who it be the time before so two years ago i be on a course on this day and i be on a course in a village somewhere north of cambridge and i get there on a random bus and the only person i could get a lift with be be in and i have to get four bus
S0123	wow
S0050	four bus to get myself from this village to
S0109	woah
S0050	for to take me down
S0050	the m whatever
S0050	a1m
S0050	it be ridiculous
S0123	we crash
S0034	that's a good effort that be
S0123	cos you couldn't turn the couldn't use the gear because your hand be stick in a box of pringles
S0050	just show how rubbish the bus service be though in doesn't it
S0123	mm
S0050	it be appal
S0109	sometimes they just don't turn up that's it that get me annoy like you go on a walk you plan your whole walk around the
S0050	thank you
S0109	fact that there will be a bus arrive
S0050	yeah
S0109	at this point
S0123	mm
S0109	and then the bus driver decide that actually he can't be bother that day
S0109	thank
S0123	you see i've always be bless to live in place where when i use to need to use the bus they're pretty regularly it's pretty regular so the village where i use to er where my parent live be just on the it's literally smack bang between two towns so the bus go between them regularly manchester that's apparently europe's busiest bus route i live on it be just like you literally have five bus turn up at once which be a bite useless so i never have to worry about them
S0050	it be amaze though that be so good for bike
S0034	mm
S0109	how far be it to your school
S0050	mm it's where meet
S0109	where do meet
S0050	oh um it's like seven minutes on a bike
S0109	oh cool
S0050	it's really close
S0123	that's amaze but i would love them to be um a little bite stricter on people who cycle about i mean without light and that kind of stuff
S0050	mm
S0123	cos um almost come on you can do it you can get these pringles out and change gear in time so we don't die
S0034	no need to change gear gear change be overrate
S0109	i'd be i'd love to see them crack down on light except for the fact that every so often my front light decide that it just doesn't want to light up and you have to sort of whack it on the grind
S0123	mm
S0109	several time to make it work
S0050	mm yeah
S0123	the thing be you just get these muppets cycle around wear black in the dark cycle er sometimes quite fast you're like how the hell be i suppose to see you i mean yeah i it's just and actually i don't like pedestrians who walk through the dark where you're cycle again wear black like you're black on black you know i can't you know my front light's fairly powerful but not that powerful that i'm gonna see you in time
S0034	be that hampton court
S0123	mm somewhere posh
S0034	you would've think they wouldn't have build it so close to the motorway
S0034	yeah

S0034	oh
S0050	the question i ask want to ask be like how do it go when you know it

S0034	do you mean in term of how how do we do it
S0109	how fast
S0050	yeah
S0034	um
S0050	what be you do with this car like
S0034	probably about right
S0050	be you do some crazy race with this guy
S0034	no i'm just annoy him
S0034	cos he be drive right he just zoom up to me
S0123	mm
S0034	and drive right on my bumper so i slow right down
S0109	you're in the fast lane
S0034	and then he go into that lane so i speed up a bite
S0034	so he couldn't go past
S0123	oh dear
S0034	uh sorry i couldn't resist it
S0050	he's on his phone
S0123	really
S0050	he doesn't really care
S0034	speed
S0123	yeah
S0034	whatever
S0123	but he's oh next to the white car isn't it who's er
S0034	i think we do it about the same kind of speed
S0050	oh really
S0034	mm
S0109	i really wanna play the drum becca
S0050	you wanna play the drum you should learn
S0109	yeah i'm i'm learn now learn to drive so that i can learn to play the drum
S0050	so you can go and
S0123	wow
S0050	how how would that help so you can
S0109	so i can
S0050	drive around
S0109	so i can tick off the thing that i have to do
S0050	oh i see
S0109	before i start on the thing that i want to do
S0123	oh i think er that it be like to transport it
S0050	so how be you learn to drive be you have lot of lessons
S0109	i start some lessons
S0050	how's it go
S0109	mm yeah okay
S0123	cool
S0109	my instructor say i be i be quite a natural so i be quite
S0123	you should've
S0050	quite a natural
S0109	it be quite nice i be terrify i spend the whole lesson go
S0050	where do you go where do he take you
S0109	out to and out through the and then
S0050	quite scary drive in a city
S0109	mm
S0050	i remember my dad take me round the carpark a couple of time when i first start to learn to drive and i be absolutely awful just stall all the way round the carpark it be fun though don't have to worry about hill no hill start in
S0109	mm true but not as fun as learn to play the drum
S0050	no that would be fun
S0034	oh
S0050	although it i think it be quite frustrate cos i think it's one of those things where like every musical instrument you kind of that you're rubbish and then you get reasonably good quite quickly have this
S0109	oh yeah and then you have to work hard at it after that
S0050	kind of really fun thing and then it's quite hard work so i'm at i'm at that stage have start the um i could just about drum a rhythm
S0109	mhm
S0050	and feel like i'm in control of the drum but actually to do anything better i now need to properly practise and i can't be bother i be like that with the trumpet i borrow a 's trumpet don't know how long ago two years ago i learn to play it so i could play the note i could play a scale i could play some rough things and then i couldn't be bother any more it be a bite bore after i'd learn to play it
S0123	but isn't
S0050	didn't sound very nice but i could just about blast out some note
S0123	but isn't that like all there be to er the trumpet
S0123	once you once you can do a scale and then you know improvise a little bite
S0050	there be something to say for technique and tone and
S0123	oh okay
S0050	and
S0109	but it's not an excite instrument i'm sorry
S0050	the trumpet
S0109	trumpet no
S0050	well no i really want to play it cos i want to be able to play er in carol
S0109	ah
S0050	i think it's fun then
S0109	i suppose
S0050	you do all the descant but you have to learn to play quite high for that
S0034	why be it not an excite instrument
S0109	but there be just some instrument which you know you look at them and you think i want to play that and i don't i don't feel that with the trumpet
S0123	the trumpet's more of an iconic thing i mean er louis armstrong's a trumpeter isn't he and um er
S0050	huh
S0123	be it louis armstrong be a trumpeter wasn't he
S0050	yep
S0123	and that kind of stuff so you've get a couple of like really iconic guy who play the instrument and that sell it to you that's what something like the um for me you know some of the other instrument like er clarinet someone cool to be the face of it
S0034	benny goodman
S0123	benny who
S0034	benny goodman
S0123	you see there's the problem there
S0034	king of the clarinet
S0050	i don't think the clarinet be that be that cool and trendy
S0034	no
S0123	but it it it lack someone to make it cool
S0034	a lot of people um see it as a holder clarinet and then i'll do the saxophone that's the cool point
S0050	and then what
S0034	learn the clarinet before you learn the saxophone
S0050	yeah which be ridiculous
S0034	but that would just confuse me because the fingering's different
S0050	because the fingering's different and the saxophone i think be much easier isn't it
S0123	hm
S0050	than clarinet
S0034	er i dunno
S0123	i dunno
S0034	yeah
S0109	but if you do the soprano wouldn't it be the same
S0050	no i can pretty much play the the saxophone just because i play the oboe cos the fingering's the same
S0123	mm
S0050	and i could play a lot of tune on a saxophone but i couldn't really play the clarinet
S0109	oh okay
S0050	i find it that much harder
S0034	really
S0050	yeah
S0109	i think the clarinet suffer because of the oboe
S0050	do you think so
S0109	yeah cos the oboe's more distinguish than like the clarinet be
S0034	yeah i agree
S0050	yeah
S0034	and they look kind of the same so therefore
S0123	they must be the same
S0034	apart from the clarinet doesn't sound quite as good although it's very difficult to get a good noise out of an oboe i think
S0050	i think the the good thing about the clarinet be you can play quite funky music with it in a way that you just can't with the oboe
S0123	how come
S0050	um the oboe just doesn't really have the sound
S0034	you don't really play jazz oboe do you so
S0123	just
S0050	the jazz oboe be
S0034	although i'm really disappoint i have never really play jazz clarinet
S0050	be yet to be discover
S0034	cos that be actually quite cool i mean i listen to like some supertramp songs and i'm like oh man
S0123	this could've be me i could've be
S0034	jazz clarinet and stuff
S0123	you know well
S0123	i love the end of um be it joni mitchell's play real good for free there's i think there's jazz clarinet at the at the end of that sound absolutely awesome
S0034	but then soprano sax be also very cool
S0123	so i i try play the sax obviously i wasn't very good but i just there be part of me which you see well i love play the classical er guitar cos even though i'm not very good at it it can make a nice sound and i just never get the feel like with that with the saxophone i be it always felt like you know maybe it be just the instrument i have but
S0050	but
S0123	it didn't feel like it be ever gonna make a nice sound there wasn't
S0050	but the
S0034	but i think partly you know
S0123	mm
S0034	you just have to you just have to you just get better and better
S0050	yeah
S0123	mm
S0034	and you can you can always tell someone who's better than someone else because your sound get better
S0050	i think the
S0034	and there's no way of skip that out
S0050	the guitar as well like it's like the piano um in a sense
S0123	mm
S0050	that it's like everything's there you don't need anything else
S0123	mm
S0050	whereas with the saxophone you kind of you kind of need something else you can't just play the saxophone on its own it doesn't really sound that good
S0034	no
S0123	mm
S0050	unless you're amaze um whereas put it in a band or put it with some kind of accompaniment of some sort
S0123	oh okay
S0050	and it'd be really cool but your guitar you could just sit and strum or you can just sit and play
S0123	mm mm
S0050	and you don't need to have anything else
S0123	yeah i just think something i think that that's the thing for me er an instrument for me to be able to learn an instrument it have to sound good yeah by itself it have to it have to be able to engage me by itself and um ideally you know need to i think something like a guitar and a probably more so the piano it's the it's the mostly the instrument that's make the kind of the basic sound and it's learn how to put the note you know to your technique be be improve you you know unless you're mash two key at once you're you're you're genuinely get you know most of the sound out of the individual note
S0050	yeah
S0123	whereas with a saxophone
S0034	it's all about mash two key at once though
S0050	i think that's yeah i quite like that
S0050	it's quite fun
S0123	no but you know next to each other you know
S0050	yeah
S0034	then er even more so
S0050	yeah
S0123	oh have you see the new ok go er um video
S0034	yes
S0123	that be awesome
S0034	i keep a very close eye now on
S0034	on um
S0123	that be absolute fantastic so it's er these guy er have you see you know ok go so there a er basically sort of punk rock band i guess er poppy punk rock band um it's a american punk rock band supposedly anyway they they always do these really crazy music videos um which sort of have become more successful than any of their music um and famously a while ago they do the kind of dance on um run machine dunno if you saw that so they they do this dance routine on the on these er six run machine they'd all set up
S0109	have you try it
S0034	uh
S0123	sorry
S0109	have you try it
S0123	no no
S0034	have you
S0109	no
S0123	er
S0034	they sort of glide
S0109	i haven't see it
S0034	backwards and forward
S0123	yeah they
S0034	so they've get six of them like three and then three and they're run in opposite direction opposite direction opposite direction so they're they can kind of glide like this by step forward
S0123	mm
S0034	and backwards
S0050	oh i love it
S0034	so as they walk on it they all kind of go wuh sort of glide around the place it look really cool
S0123	it be it be really cool
S0034	they get kind of big for that and then they do another one which be like the um honda advert
S0123	oh
S0034	you know where
S0123	oh giant rube goldberb machine
S0034	like one thing hit another thing one thing that hit another thing that kind of thing
S0050	yeah
S0109	mm
S0034	and they do that in one shoot but the clever thing be they the noise that the thing be make as it be run
S0123	mm
S0034	be in the tune so like
S0050	oh cool
S0034	there'd be a little steel ball that go ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding hit like you know xylophone things of whatever and as it fell down it would fall in the right rhythm so it
S0050	that's really cool
S0034	would fit in with the music and the guy just sort of walk along by the side of it do
S0123	mm
S0034	like sing the
S0123	song
S0034	melody so er that be really cool but their latest one you've gotta find it
S0123	yeah it's the drive and it be it be really cool and apparently i saw the thing the note on it cos you think they're fake it right you know they they can't all be drive but they just they're just very clever um
S0050	be that it
S0123	yeah it be it's er it'll take a bite of time to like for the but that's just yeah i mean i'll show you first and then then ponder it wonder at it later on
S0034	it's not quite as good as i think it be gonna be
S0123	no it do it's
S0034	it's impressive
S0123	it's impressive
S0034	but it's just
S0123	and when you when you start to realize actually all the instrument be make the sound
S0034	yeah i don't think you could've make it any better
S0123	no
S0034	but
S0123	idea
S0123	so there's little nail on that board
S0050	that's amaze
S0109	what's on the front
S0123	um little metal things
S0109	that be just mad
S0109	that's very clever
S0123	it be amazingly good
S0109	i like that
S0109	that's very cool
S0123	so what they do with the pianos be they tune them all to the the right note on all the key
S0050	oh so then they won't
S0123	so that wherever they be hit they would make the right noise
S0109	so they're not record it as they do it
S0123	yeah they be
S0109	but how do they get the quality of sound then
S0123	they get if you look in the car they've get load of microphones think you can see there's a boom mic on top of the car
S0109	what's
S0123	load of guitars
S0109	that's insane
S0050	that's hilarious
S0123	i mean someone's have to tune every single one of them to be a note apparently it take them four months of shoot to film this
S0109	i'm not surprise
S0050	woah
S0109	that's thousands
S0123	i'm impress that he can sing and drive
S0034	he
S0123	at the same time
S0034	he take stunt drive test
S0123	yeah
S0034	apparently
S0123	i mean that's impressive remember to sing a song and then drive the right speed for everything
S0050	yeah but that song he's be sing it for four months
S0123	yeah
S0050	he must know that song pretty well
S0034	do we get it
S0123	mm
S0034	the um their other one be pretty good as well machine
S0123	oh yeah which one oh yeah oh er this too shall pass
S0109	so be they quite big then
S0123	yeah well their their the thing be everyone know them mostly for their er for their videos
S0034	for their videos yeah
S0123	don't know really maybe
S0109	but you don't make any money out of videos
S0123	um
S0034	but i guess a lot of people saw it and go ah that be quite
S0123	yeah i mean it's raise their publicity to like you know their videos be some of the most watch videos in the world and actually on youtube you do once you um youtube do pay you something pathetically small per video so if you get millions of view you do actually start make money out of them not much i mean they say do you remember that rebecca black with her friday song which everyone take the mickey out of
S0109	no
S0123	so
S0034	she make money out of that
S0123	yeah apparently she they reckon she'd have make about thirty grand out of everyone watch her video
S0034	really
S0123	so not much you know compare to the amount of abuse she get but
S0034	well thirty thousand pound be pretty good
S0123	yeah i know but for you know what be just a fun little day in the record studio
S0050	well
S0123	it be a birthday present i mean that's a good return on a birthday present probably probably cost her parent like
S0050	so what be it
S0123	so basically i think some rich parent buy their er um daughter i think i dunno if they be rich but basically some parent buy their daughter like a day in the record studio and part of the thing be that she also could make a music video so she just write her own little song and she put it on youtube and it's call friday and it's all about how like she want to hang out with friends
S0034	it's absolutely terrible
S0050	i i feel like um that ring a bell
S0123	yeah it
S0050	i wonder if i saw it
S0034	people be always
S0123	it's really it's really big and it's just it's just kind of vacuous the problem be it have a high enough production quality and the people take it seriously and be like it get more attention than they expect and it become like this massive thing but mostly because people didn't like it
S0050	okay
S0123	so it's just a real real shame yeah but yeah so she would've make some money out of that
S0034	and it be fairly terrible
S0123	this be the er version
S0034	do you see the colossal do you see the colossal page turner machine
S0123	what's that
S0034	page turner machine
S0123	no
S0034	do you see that oh it's hilarious
S0123	think this be it anyway oh it doesn't look like it oh maybe it be okay
S0034	do they cheat it's not all the sound no
S0123	yeah
S0034	it's all time to with the thing that be quite impressive if it be go on for age
S0034	wicked
S0123	they must just have so much fun just think up all of these things
S0034	they actually film it in one shoot so
S0123	mm
S0109	how many time they must have set all that
S0123	yeah
S0109	up though
S0034	just go on for so long
S0034	that's that be very good
S0050	that's crazy how how long do that one take to record then
S0123	dunno i mean it must've be quite a while
S0034	um which junction be we get off thirteen
S0050	yeah
S0123	um
S0050	unless you wanna do the m3
S0034	no
S0123	apparently it take several months

S0034	that's not
S0050	but i think i don't know whether
S0034	i think the roundabout be the junction with the m3
S0050	you'll be with all the girlies
S0123	er yes
S0050	you might be
S0034	oh right
S0050	cos i be last year and the year before
S0109	with all the kid
S0050	yeah not in a room but just near them you'll be
S0109	okay
S0050	in their build
S0109	right
S0050	there's lot of different build have you be there before
S0109	no
S0050	so there's lot of little random build that you have to walk in between um so it's quite chilly walk in between you have to take your shoe off whenever you get anywhere which be a bite annoy um but there's usually a room quite far away from so the girls be down at the bottom end of the build and you're up at the top
S0050	end of the build
S0109	okay
S0050	to the right i i don't know whether i'll be in there i might be in there as well um i have be for the last two years but i might have graduate to the the grow up leader dorm
S0109	oh
S0109	one of the things i have a my confession be that i be seriously my experience in camp last year be er such that i don't relish go back and one of the main things that i don't relish be go in a dorm between two room of girls and sleep in a room with seven other
S0109	you know seven other leaders i just think that's
S0123	you should manage the boys
S0109	insane
S0123	that doesn't happen
S0050	she's not a boy she can't be a boy
S0034	you didn't like sleep with other people in the room
S0109	i didn't like sleep with so many because like
S0034	oo
S0109	i'm quite an early like
S0034	where be we
S0109	i like to go go to bed before midnight and i don't take an hour and half in the mornings to get up and i don't like it when er all the alarm go off so early
S0034	have we go the wrong way
S0123	mm
S0034	i sense the wrong way
S0050	yeah it's quite hard
S0109	you feel like you know
S0123	it felt wrong
S0109	it's be
S0034	definitely since we're now go thirty miles an hour
S0123	yeah i think do a next right
S0034	right
S0123	and then for your um er so stanwell road yeah next right if we can but we can't yeah next right whatever happen
S0034	whether i can or cannot do it
S0050	just do it anyway
S0123	you know
S0050	just drive on down drive over the
S0123	there we go and there's a car go right and turn round
S0034	be we be we do a u ey like that would that be better if we do a complete u turn
S0123	yeah do a complete turn i think and
S0034	yeah
S0123	it doesn't look like you can go anywhere with this anyway it's like
S0034	turn around
S0123	this be just a complete
S0050	let's not go into that place
S0123	u ey place
S0050	yeah that place be alright
S0034	everyone love turn around
S0109	we have to do it once didn't we
S0123	that's what repentance be
S0034	actually deliberate there
S0123	turn around
S0050	i think that's probably something to say to
S0109	be it really selfish
S0050	um
S0034	yeah
S0050	not if it not if it cause you that like if it's if it's a real stress
S0034	no
S0050	for you then i think
S0123	mm
S0109	it's just i be so tire by saturday
S0050	yeah
S0123	mm
S0050	so i think that's the kind of thing you just need to say to look i'm like er it to the point of it doesn't want i don't want to come back to camp because of it
S0123	mm
S0050	i think that's definitely a worthwhile thing to
S0123	mm big
S0050	i'm not a hundred percent sure i want to go back to camp this year
S0109	everyone say it be a really tough camp
S0123	mm
S0034	where be we go
S0123	leave
S0109	be that true or
S0050	i
S0109	be they just say that to to try and convince people to come back
S0123	mm
S0050	dunno it be the first time for me be senior group leader so i have no idea what be go on the whole time
S0034	wait that say a30 that way be we go on the a30 or not
S0123	we're go down the
S0050	a yeah but the other way so we're go
S0123	we're go down the a308
S0050	oh right
S0123	a308 to
S0050	that sound good that's where we wanna go
S0123	court
S0034	i think as an observer um it do seem like you have worst behave kid than usual and that seem to be say that you know it do seem to be the observation
S0050	we we didn't have badly behave kid we just have
S0109	she could be like there be time when she just wouldn't do what she be tell
S0050	be be very she be really tricky
S0123	oh be she the one with be it
S0050	down's
S0123	down's syndrome
S0109	yeah
S0050	down's yeah
S0123	so you probably you probably need to say i guess something like this you just need people on more leaders
S0050	she
S0123	to cope with her
S0050	yeah yeah so she should have have a like a one to oner
S0123	mm
S0109	but
S0034	didn't she more or less
S0109	she do
S0034	cos you have
S0050	well between us
S0034	four of you
S0123	but even then if you've get one to oner like you you want the one to oner still need a rest at some point you know
S0109	yeah and also you need to
S0050	she be
S0109	know that before like the the day you come on camp
S0123	mm
S0109	and then you find out
S0123	yeah
S0109	i i could
S0050	she be quite she be very exhaust um she she basically couldn't do many of the activities so you have to do a different activity with her for everything
S0123	mm
S0109	the thing that get me be the fact that she get so distress when people didn't explain things to her and i couldn't explain it to her cos i didn't understand what be go on
S0123	mm
S0109	and i don't know it be quite emotional
S0050	yeah
S0123	so at the next roundabout you go straight on
S0109	do you think she's come back
S0050	i doubt it
S0050	she might do but i doubt it
S0109	do you do you know where we be
S0050	this look familiar
S0034	yeah we're on the a308 we're about i'd say twenty minutes away
S0050	so 'll be start pathfinders now
S0109	watch casablanca
S0123	yeah what's he go with
S0109	well last night he be say casablanca wasn't he
S0034	um
S0109	or be it he wasn't quite sure of it
S0034	movie to watch
S0123	well i think he's get it
S0050	i think he's gonna do cool runnings isn't he
S0123	would be a bite of a shame to waste casablanca on the kid
S0034	waste
S0123	it's true i mean like it it's a it's one of my favourite movies but i just don't think kid would appreciate it it's like make kid read you know of your all those classical book that you have to read as a kid and everyone wind up hat them because no one engage with them
S0050	yeah
S0123	you know why waste them why why you know give them something they'll enjoy and then build up to it
S0109	to be honest there aren't many really classic classic film that i enjoy that i've see i don't think i i would er like to spend an even if i be a pathfinder watch something like a film buff film do you disagree you look like you disagree
S0050	um no i sorry i wasn't really engage um i be think back to like youth club days and when i use what like what i use to enjoy i think i use to enjoy go and watch film we do occasionally do that but i think that's mainly cos we have load of really cool massive cushion and load of bean bag and like blanket and rugs and stuff not sure i'd love go and sit on a hard chair in the middle of a cold room
S0123	mm
S0109	mm
S0050	watch a film
S0109	so we didn't have like all the fun stuff like cushion and stuff but i think we get to watch things that we wouldn't watch at home which be quite fun strange to
S0050	yeah
S0109	er but
S0034	cool
S0050	i'd never see anything cos i never really watch any film when i be little so for me everything be a novelty
S0050	oh i'm watch a film amaze i never watch film um but i think most of these kid have watch a lot more film that we do we hardly we didn't hardly have any pathfinders last week
S0109	there weren't very many this time cos it's half term
S0050	mm i remember go there and buy deodorant i forget my deodorant that be interest wasn't it
S0123	that be
S0109	you ought to be a tour guide
S0050	you turn right somewhere here don't you
S0123	yeah
S0034	this place be really nice when it's sunny
S0050	have you be here when it's sunny
S0034	no
S0050	oh right i don't think it be that nice
S0034	i'm just quote you
S0050	oh right
S0123	so let's party dot co dot uk let's let's party
S0050	i think it's a not that nice place
S0123	let's have a er party
S0034	that black dog really look like the black dog that people be think of when they name that pub
S0123	mm
S0050	what do you think look like
S0034	i dunno i just imagine the black dog to be a bite more intimidate
S0123	that's true well maybe it be a warner brothers character well maybe that's suppose to be the black duck they get it wrong
S0109	cheapest pub in be that what you really look for in
S0123	cheapest that i know yeah
S0109	mm
S0123	carling foster and stella wow classy that's at weekend as well at the weekend cheapest pub let's say you spend the weekend imbibe the cheapest beers you can find in the cheapest pub and then get lairy actually there be something that strike me recently there's um do any of you guy hear about say like he say something along the line that there's no one in the uk currently proclaim the gospel properly something like that
S0050	no one
S0123	sorry
S0050	no one
S0123	yeah well or no one big you know it be he he say he be misquote but er there be an interest response by carson um who say that you know he's experience the uk well it's different he say that there be um there's lot of struggle but he say fundamentally it's the uk's kind of equivalent of japan in term of you know christian the evangelical christian population um in his opinion but anyway he he he say you know there have be lot of people proclaim he refer back to the um welsh the revival in the welsh valleys and apparently what they would do be that they would go out and they'd preach in front of the pubs and they'd get beat up and kick and then they'd er go away and er mend their wound and come back and preach again he say and that be the foundation of the of the um revival be um um men um risk physical harm to spread the gospel um
S0109	but wasn't it also the fact that they be the er someone say recently um maybe in a sermon that they it be because they be all sort of share er share their live with one another because the
S0123	yeah
S0109	welsh valleys be
S0034	yeah who say that cos i hear that
S0123	be it
S0109	or it could've be at new wine
S0123	oh yeah
S0034	oh yeah
S0123	could've be at new wine i think yeah there there be there be obviously things which be um the which be at there be there be different components which make up a revival i'm not sure if there's a science to it but without the you know if you don't proclaim the gospel somewhere people don't hear it then you're never gonna get anywhere um no gospel no revival
S0109	true but if you just go and stand
S0034	that say sunbury that way where be we go you say i'm stay on the three o eight i suspect sunbury
S0123	oh my google map have just crash you've get so lose it crash
S0034	give that we're go to sunbury court sunbury be probably
S0123	where be the
S0034	somewhere nearby
S0123	be that the junction with the duh duh duh oh yeah just take the next right
S0034	and turn around
S0123	no
S0050	mm
S0123	okay turn around next road
S0050	i be gonna say i know it's a house estate but this really be a house estate
S0123	yeah
S0123	well it's the next one within the avenue which would've which we've just go parallel with the road that we need
S0034	mm
S0123	so can i either turn around
S0034	wow i actually get it into reverse
S0123	you can actually
S0034	this be a real turn around
S0123	you can you can turn out and turn right again if you want to
S0034	really
S0123	yeah
S0034	why don't i go leave and go back that way
S0123	um
S0034	or be it worse
S0123	it's well the leave be a be a bigger road
S0034	i like that
S0123	so
S0034	let's go that way
S0123	so be you take the first exit and then go back then all the way down until you hit the river then reverse up the river and er turn er oh let me try and work it out leave again i think have to hold the map upside down
S0034	yeah leave here
S0123	but no go back to the thing about what's he be say about that i'd be curious i mean
S0034	dink
S0123	would the lessons would the lessons of the welsh revival lead us to um preach proclaim the gospel outside the regal on a friday night i mean you'd certainly get beat up do that but would it bear fruit
S0109	the the the fact that you get beat up doesn't make the gospel any you know that's not the power of the gospel
S0123	no not a black eye but the i guess the observation would be that um be not the kind of place which attract the um world's best custom and that perhaps they're the people who would respond the um best to the gospel and that's where they be that's where they all congregate how else do you reach them
S0109	don't know
S0034	buy them a pint
S0123	yeah go in there buy everyone a pint
S0034	double check
S0034	this area look nice
S0050	everything look quite old here
S0034	mm
S0050	don't recognize this at all
S0123	but then leave you go leave and then there'll probably be people um or about um well look at it it's about one and a half inch on my screen
S0050	there'll be what
S0123	there'll there'll probably be people stand out to welcome us in
S0050	oh yeah
S0123	so
S0050	this look more familiar
S0123	i have to do that last time
S0109	even though it's so cold
S0050	no because 's build those or paint those sign that have glow in the dark paint on
S0123	oh okay so no it'll be the fourth leave
S0050	quarter to eight isn't bad
S0123	no no not no despite be lose once or twice
S0034	lose
S0123	just take the wrong turn
