S0369	how long have you have it
S0252	ten years
S0369	mm
S0368	it's not repairable
S0252	well
S0251	well
S0252	the problem be
S0251	there's a hefty callout fee
S0368	oh heavens yeah
S0252	erm miele the make don't distribute the part to any other person they will keep all the part to themselves
S0368	oh right
S0252	so unless
S0369	they've get the monopoly there then
S0252	it's a miele man who come to look at it
S0368	i see yes
S0252	you it's
S0368	you couldn't
S0252	no you can't
S0368	get the part yeah
S0252	but it's ninety five pound to call them out

S0368	yes
S0252	ninety five yes
S0369	nine five

S0368	good grief you could put that towards another one couldn't you
S0369	well

S0369	it's obviously er to get you buy another isn't it
S0251	yeah
S0368	yeah
S0251	that's it
S0369	mm
S0252	the crucial thing be possibly this time to try and get one with a longer guarantee if you get one with a ten year guarantee
S0368	oh right yes
S0252	then there's no charge for them to come out
S0368	would you get the same make
S0252	it's a bite of the problem and if you're open the good old which magazine

S0369	be they
S0368	oh
S0252	miele be suppose to be the most reliable as well

S0369	oh do you mm
S0252	it's really as much as that
S0369	mm funny that because i be wonder why you know er er mine sometimes i think well that's erm go down like but of course i always have it on the brightest

S0369	uhu
S0252	then we walk back to the car park and car access isn't allow down
S0369	mm
S0252	so we have to go back to and then we come on to road here

S0368	yeah well that's
S0251	i've get some options
S0368	you could
S0251	yeah
S0368	yeah well yeah but it's er within an area that you feel
S0251	yeah confident in
S0368	yes yeah
S0251	mm yeah so it's be very useful
S0368	mm
S0251	for during the summer holiday
S0368	mm
S0251	things like that
S0368	you've be to quite a few place haven't you
S0251	mm yeah
S0368	have you be to this year yet

S0252	you can't remember
S0251	how to get to the university er by myself
S0252	oh right
S0251	can i
S0251	i can't remember it all and i think it's further than i think it's go to be
S0252	mm
S0368	mm yes it
S0251	so i start think i think i should have
S0251	do something turn off before now
S0368	before yes
S0251	i seem to have be on this road a long time
S0368	well then your dad say it be further than he think
S0251	it be yeah
S0368	yeah
S0251	and it's get in all the right lanes as well
S0368	oh yes
S0251	i still can't remember all that
S0368	inner road all that
S0251	and
S0368	yeah
S0251	on the roundabouts that be different lanes on the roundabout and there's traffic light on the roundabout i find that a bite unusual
S0368	mm mm
S0251	yeah
S0368	i'd be stop every five minutes
S0251	i don't know how remember it all really
S0368	i don't isn't he
S0251	he just know and
S0368	yeah
S0251	it's alright you know he say if you drive down i'll drive back because i'll know it by then
S0368	yes right
S0251	well i won't you know he can retrace it if he's do it
S0368	yeah
S0251	he say well you remember this and you remember well no i don't really you kind of do when you point it out but
S0368	yes but not
S0251	by myself
S0368	no well even if when you're go to a place erm and we come out of a different entrance
S0251	of a shop yes it's a bite confuse
S0368	i don't remember this bite no this isn't where we come this be
S0251	not right
S0252	and then i'll show you the way to the
S0369	oh right
S0252	so we start there come out along road take the second exit er that lane here on to road and then here then if we be go back to you would turn down there the first exit
S0369	mm
S0252	but we take the second exit it's the a166 er but just zoom out show you where the a166 go so it go so it go to bridge
S0369	uhu
S0252	but actually you be go a bite between
S0369	yes
S0252	yes
S0369	yeah
S0252	same road here
S0369	mm
S0252	the first time be
S0369	so yeah at
S0252	yes
S0369	that road er
S0252	i mean the pass and the roundabout that good straight road so i think you would
S0252	you'd go up here
S0252	yes
S0369	yes that's it
S0252	yes
S0369	there that one
S0252	and then you'd turn
S0369	up there somewhere
S0252	yes
S0369	mm and then there
S0252	then this up there
S0369	yeah when i get to
S0252	yes
S0369	if i go er straight to there i'd come to then
S0252	yes bridge
S0369	mm mm
S0252	yeah and be just before bridge it's there
S0369	uhu
S0252	and then i'll show you this back road which be not easy to follow but er anyway
S0251	i hate it when they say back road
S0368	yes
S0251	be it back of what
S0251	doesn't make sense
S0252	well what would you call it then
S0251	i don't know
S0252	well
S0252	criticise and
S0251	well because i don't think there should be two ways of get to the same place that's not a good er be it
S0252	well
S0368	when you don't know it
S0369	that's confuse
S0251	it be
S0369	mm
S0252	well
S0251	you just stick to one
S0252	it's in some ways it's good you have two ways because if one's
S0251	yes
S0252	clog up
S0251	yes
S0252	we've get another
S0251	an alternative
S0252	you know if
S0251	yeah
S0252	i've get to be at the university for a set time
S0251	mm
S0252	and there's a big traffic jam on the a64
S0368	mm
S0252	that's a really useful route to know
S0251	suppose
S0368	well your mum she do really well when you go up to that school
S0251	mm
S0368	and er you go up a few time didn't you
S0251	oh yes
S0368	to and then dad say alternatively you could
S0251	yeah no no no no
S0368	don't tell me
S0368	don't tell me about it don't want to know
S0251	if i remember one way i'll be glad
S0368	yes
S0368	well you do that for quite a while didn't you
S0251	mm about five years
S0368	yeah
S0251	mm
S0368	be it what be it five years
S0251	mm
S0368	oh
S0251	yeah
S0368	i never know where i be when we go up that way i use to hate go to when your dad be have his treatment
S0251	mm
S0368	you know it be up that way where dad say this be the way i use to
S0251	yeah
S0368	it just seem alien to me
S0251	it do it's so unfamiliar
S0368	yeah
S0252	it's er well we turn up erm at this street here
S0369	uhu
S0252	and then that's that really awful bend do you remember
S0369	yes i do
S0252	that's and then this road go to a village call on there so there's
S0369	uhu
S0252	there's that that's all that like bridge with this silly side and it's up here on lane street er and then that end up into
S0369	mm could get lose here
S0368	mm
S0369	we'll stick to the a roads
S0368	okay
S0369	and go to that one then we've get oh when we come this morning the gate be shut wasn't they
S0368	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	oh it get murder there
S0369	and there be people try to cross that
S0251	mm
S0369	little road that we
S0368	weren't they
S0369	until we get over the railway line we do a leave turn well there be cars there wait to come out there and they be over a bite you know so
S0251	mm
S0369	very difficult to do that turn
S0251	i know
S0252	it be
S0369	and if people
S0368	it's tight isn't it
S0369	try to get through there
S0251	i know
S0369	mm
S0251	there's maybe a bike and a pushchair and
S0369	oh
S0251	terrible
S0252	what be a bite of a shame be there be a good maybe seventy five a hundred metres from the station to that cross which be perfectly straight it would be it wouldn't be too difficult to actually have a little tunnel under there
S0369	another little
S0252	a tunnel under the
S0369	a tunnel
S0252	that road
S0369	mm
S0252	i mean there's enough
S0368	mm
S0252	to just have a gentle
S0251	what for people
S0369	mm
S0252	decline
S0251	you mean
S0252	no the well it would be the railway track
S0369	mm
S0251	oh for the train to go under
S0252	yes
S0369	mm
S0252	well it would be much safer
S0368	mm it would
S0252	i don't think that cross be not
S0369	ah no it wouldn't it would flood
S0252	that would be the only problem it would have be
S0251	mm
S0252	very well support
S0369	cos when there be flood be here
S0252	yeah
S0368	mm
S0251	that's where it be
S0368	yes
S0369	we take him didn't we to see
S0368	yes
S0369	on that car park
S0368	mm
S0369	morrisons car park
S0368	oh yes
S0369	mm wellingtons on wasn't it
S0368	yes
S0369	mm i be amaze how much of that mind you you've get that wall there haven't now
S0251	yeah they have now
S0369	but nevertheless it would still hey you've get a dirty screen there all these
S0252	mm
S0369	fingerprint there it's almost a good pattern isn't it
S0252	but it's it would really be the best way because if you've there wouldn't be enough er incline to do a bridge for the bridge to hang
S0369	no
S0252	to let all the lorries through
S0369	i know
S0252	so
S0369	mm
S0368	there be some massive
S0369	mm
S0368	lorries now aren't there
S0251	yeah
S0368	the supermarket ones
S0251	that's right
S0369	i don't know really how it's all get like that all come to that one point
S0251	it's too complicate at that point isn't it
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0252	mm i mean er have to go quite some way out of your way to find another cross over that
S0369	i know but
S0252	you know
S0369	it seem to me well actually i remember read a plaque in when the railways be and it be
S0251	mm
S0369	someone who this plaque be to someone call george hudson who have a lot to do with the railways
S0251	mm
S0369	and he say all railways make them go to
S0251	mm
S0368	mm
S0369	well i think that er idea strike on and when they build a new road round here make it go
S0251	mm
S0369	to the railway and so you've get all these roads
S0251	mm
S0369	one two three four at least and the railway and
S0251	mm
S0369	the bridge and the oh it's all
S0251	mm
S0369	come to the same
S0251	mm i know
S0369	point
S0251	point
S0369	as though
S0251	yeah
S0369	er there be it's if you ever need there be no evidence of er plan
S0368	mm
S0369	that be it
S0251	mm
S0369	so you don't need plan
S0368	well they
S0369	and you'll end up like that
S0368	i always think if you
S0369	now if they be go to put another road in it'll go to there
S0251	mm mm
S0369	but where else can it go
S0251	i don't know
S0369	it can't can it
S0251	no
S0369	and
S0368	but when you think of the emergency service
S0251	mm
S0368	you know if
S0251	yeah
S0368	everybody's stick at the
S0251	well the fire engine place be down there
S0369	yeah
S0369	well
S0368	yeah
S0369	in as you know it's cut in half with the river
S0252	mm
S0369	er we have bridge we've what's the others
S0251	be it
S0369	bridge there be a bridge yes that that's a fairly modern one really now
S0251	er
S0369	er but anyhow if there's a ship
S0251	mm
S0369	come up the river the bridge go up it it cut do you want to take this off me now
S0252	okay yes
S0369	it cut in half so much so that at one time a fire engine when the bridge be gonna go up
S0252	mm
S0369	they have to let the fire engine know
S0252	yes
S0369	and it would go across to the other side because if there be an emergency
S0251	they wouldn't be able to get across it
S0369	and it's not just the bridge it it's all block up there's nowhere for anyone to go
S0251	so you want to divide the fire engines up
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	so they have to put over there
S0251	yeah
S0369	mm mm
S0252	i mean it's not impossible to get to the side without go that over that cross but it's a good couple of miles out of your way
S0369	yeah well
S0251	and i don't know the route
S0369	that's another thing
S0369	not everyone know the route
S0368	that make it difficult
S0251	be it that field thing
S0252	mm yes it be mm
S0369	yes you would think that er it would be very difficult to address wouldn't it
S0251	mm
S0369	er
S0251	that's why it hasn't be do i think
S0369	well
S0368	mm
S0251	cos they don't
S0369	yes you see
S0251	know what the answer be
S0369	there isn't one be there really
S0251	not really
S0369	well you could say let's look at it this way what be it be it the roads that's mess it up be it the railway that's mess it up be it the railway that have to do something
S0251	i think even if the railway wasn't there it would still be a bad corner
S0369	well it would mm maybe worse actually i mean if the railway be rerouted somewhere
S0251	mm
S0369	i don't know
S0251	you could still never get out of that street that asda's on can you
S0369	no and then of course you've get that little bridge over there
S0251	mm
S0369	very difficult
S0251	mm
S0368	do you get those twig out of the car
S0369	do i get sweetheart
S0368	twig
S0369	yes i've get them have get them
S0368	oh right
S0369	and they're over at this side
S0368	oh right
S0369	and he's get the tie wrap
S0368	mm
S0369	which
S0368	do he need any help with them
S0369	i don't know
S0368	do you need any help with those do the
S0252	er
S0368	tree
S0252	i don't know happy to receive any help
S0368	well go and look at the tree and see that break branch
S0251	they might be able to get them on the branch to hold the erm weak ones up that be best to do it now before the plums get big
S0368	yes
S0251	then we get them
S0368	yeah i don't know how they do it though do you
S0251	mm
S0368	i think you'd have to get a make before you could
S0251	mm
S0368	say do you want them
S0251	mm
S0368	and then that's the difficult bite isn't it
S0251	cos if you make plum jam when it be a big success you only get an opportunity to make it for about two weeks of the year
S0368	mm
S0251	if you run out you run out till
S0368	mm
S0251	next year because
S0368	mm
S0251	i don't know where else you would get them even in another country if you go to say france or greece i don't think they would have victoria plums maybe
S0368	no poland use to they be strawberries weren't they that come from poland at one time
S0251	yeah soft fruit some
S0368	mm
S0369	what be that
S0368	poland use to have a lot of strawberries
S0369	mm
S0368	didn't they
S0369	well when be at ticklers
S0368	mm
S0369	they for their jam they get their strawberries from poland
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0251	yeah some of the freeze ones soft fruit come from poland
S0369	because in the er first world war there be you know to you imagine feed all that lot our troop and one of the stable or staple er be bread and jam but the officer er the the er ordinary
S0251	the men
S0369	men the ordinary rank they get plum jam
S0251	oh right
S0369	but the officer get strawberry jam
S0251	oh right
S0369	mm the difference but we be say about this because it be in a er a book we be read so we have a look at it and because it go on to say that the management at ticklers buy all the instrument for a band
S0251	mm
S0369	you know because they know that a band er and that er their music really cheer everybody up and be good for the morale and that and he he buy like ticklers jam buy these instrument mm
S0251	and do the band get go
S0369	yes yes
S0251	mm
S0369	well in those days a lot of people er could play a lot of these instrument
S0251	mm
S0369	i mean today we could almost say the instrument most people play now be a guitar isn't it
S0251	mm
S0369	whereas i mean you take er salvation army
S0251	mm
S0369	they've get er well everything er to the old er well the the er french horn and and
S0368	well we've get three brass band i can think of straight away round here there's the salvation army
S0369	be there mm
S0368	there's the brass band
S0369	yes
S0251	mm
S0368	and there's the isn't there

S0369	we pass salvation army
S0251	yeah
S0369	on the way back don't we

S0251	atmosphere it's usually windy and there's plastic bag fly about and it it's take you about three minutes to look round everything and then

S0368	i use to enjoy go there
S0251	and kind of slide off without be notice
S0251	whereas before it use to sound really jolly didn't it

S0369	be you affect by pasta cos that's what it they they mainly
S0251	do my best won't i
S0369	mm can you have pasta here
S0251	i haven't for some time
S0252	well
S0251	because it contain egg
S0252	pasta be it's a bite of a tricky thing
S0368	mm
S0252	pasta can be just durum wheat and water
S0368	mm
S0252	which taste that would fulfil all the requirements it match typically er make in the south of italy but if you're in the north of italy they do pasta a bite differently and they throw an egg in as well
S0368	mm
S0369	they're make with egg
S0368	egg
S0252	durum wheat
S0369	egg or and water
S0368	which be not
S0369	so
S0251	suppose to have it
S0369	that could be a problem then
S0251	mm
S0252	potentially
S0369	mm
S0251	i'm have a little bite more now aren't i so
S0368	mm yeah that's good and you seem a bite more happy in yourself
S0251	mm yeah
S0252	i mean go on holiday it's it's not easy it's sort of sort everything out it's it's
S0369	no
S0252	a bite
S0369	no yeah and furthermore you go on holiday in britain and you can feel a little bite funny and they say it's a change of water
S0252	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	you've get a bite of bun on your nose
S0251	ah still there
S0369	i shouldn't eat it just in case it isn't
S0251	have you catch it
S0252	think so
S0369	but you can just just with your water er drink a change of drink water
S0251	mm
S0369	it can i mean for example er sheffield area be be very soft water here we're hard water
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	er actually
S0251	mm
S0368	mm it be
S0369	mm
S0251	mm
S0369	and when er our and when to on their big european tour into russia er moscow as well er they be tell don't even clean your teeth with tap water no tap water at all you would think russia
S0251	mm
S0369	would have a good weren't they
S0368	mm
S0369	i say that's right it be all bottle water that they drink
S0252	mm it's like that in greece
S0369	be it
S0252	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	mm i'm really surprise when you erm you know just have a look at railways it's er er nice to moscow and paris to moscow
S0252	sleepers er
S0368	oh
S0368	mm
S0252	i mean thirty six hours from paris to moscow be not bad
S0369	what for price
S0252	thirty six hours it take
S0369	yeah
S0252	thirty six hours from paris to
S0369	mm but how much do that cost like
S0252	well they give twenty five percent discount if your birthday be within a certain number of days from your departure
S0369	mm
S0252	but it's about erm four hundred pound return
S0251	be that right
S0369	mm
S0251	what difference do that make when your birthday be
S0252	well it's just an offer
S0368	mm
S0368	somebody's think about it's a good idea
S0369	well no have you see that advert with the meerkats
S0251	i try not to
S0369	you know the meerkats
S0251	mm
S0252	mm
S0369	mm and they're go along and they're in hollywood aren't they in this and he's drive and he he break up but he's he's hit who have he hit spielberg or somebody
S0368	no
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0368	erm
S0369	and he say what we can do be we can give some free meerkat ticket for the cinema two ticket for and of course they've knock this guy down
S0368	it's schwarzenegger isn't it
S0369	mm
S0368	it's arnold
S0369	schwarzenegger
S0368	schwarzenegger
S0369	mm you know that big chap spill all his coffee and that over his er mm and er they have to do a quick about turn but er it just right let's think of a good offer we can give them that if their birthday be in whatever of them depart we can give them a birthday present mm
S0368	mm dad be just say about get his first class ticket and er a lunch didn't he when we go to where be it
S0252	the first
S0368	a first class ticket on the train
S0252	erm when we go from york to edinburgh
S0368	that be it
S0251	mm
S0252	yes
S0368	and it be be erm such a small amount wasn't it
S0369	mm
S0252	yes
S0251	the difference yes
S0368	yeah
S0251	sometimes it be
S0252	yes i mean even erm i remember i go to london once it be actually a few pound cheaper
S0368	yeah
S0252	to travel first class than second
S0251	mm don't know how they work it out
S0368	i don't know i don't know how they
S0251	no
S0252	well what happen be if you think there's like ten different well it's more than ten but just erm for illustration purpose ten different price so there might be
S0368	yeah
S0252	twenty ticket at five pound and then at five pound increments etcetera so if they'd sell i don't know a hundred erm second class ticket for that train that might be in band five twenty five pound but if for example first class start at ten but they haven't get many book first class
S0251	mm
S0252	it'll still be at the ten pound carry but if there's lot of book in second class that will potentially be a higher band
S0368	yeah i know i mean you can pay over a hundred pound to go to london can't you
S0251	oh mm
S0368	normally
S0251	mm
S0252	it's all about book it in a really far in advance for
S0368	mm
S0252	that sort of journey
S0368	mm
S0252	i mean i remember once all three of us do to london for thirty eight pound
S0368	oh mm
S0369	you'll have see to that then
S0251	mm
S0369	you will have see to that
S0252	yes it's
S0369	mm absolutely
S0252	but the fare be ninety four each
S0368	uhu i like train travel don't you
S0251	mm easier isn't it
S0368	mm it be it's easier than plane isn't it
S0251	mm
S0369	mind you though
S0368	what
S0369	don't always get a seat do you
S0368	no
S0369	and you see them crowd aren't they some of them
S0368	well yeah
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0252	i would say that's generally more the sort of local and regional train that
S0369	yeah
S0252	be more crowd because
S0251	mm
S0252	it's intercity or eurostar it's usually a reservation be compulsory
S0368	mm
S0369	it compulsory reservations
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0369	mm
S0368	mm
S0369	no stand on eurostar then
S0252	no well it on eurostar you be assign a seat with a ticket and once all the seat be all the ticket go
S0368	mm
S0252	but i think that's more to do with safety than anything else
S0368	mm
S0369	i would say so mm
S0252	and you can't stand for two hours so
S0368	mm mm we use to stand a lot on the train didn't we come from
S0369	oh
S0368	mind it's years and years ago
S0368	but mm
S0369	mm
S0368	we've be twice in the erm the carriage
S0369	the guard's van
S0368	the guard's van
S0369	mm
S0368	just stand and we stand with your mother when she be a baby
S0369	teethe i believe
S0368	yes
S0369	mm
S0251	yeah
S0368	but you've no you've nowhere to lean against really it
S0252	mm
S0368	you know i mean if if you go you know round the edge you know the you be just sway
S0252	it's tempt to go on the train to italy
S0251	mm
S0252	tempt
S0251	mm
S0368	how would you do that
S0252	it's a bite complicate
S0368	yeah
S0252	erm if you want to get you can do to milan in one day
S0368	oh
S0251	mm
S0368	yeah
S0252	but
S0369	you're there that's italy you've arrive that's it it's italy
S0252	yes but when because we're want to be a bite further south than sort of tuscany
S0368	mm
S0252	it's we can't do that in one day from
S0368	oh right
S0252	so if you want to do tuscany you would either need to stay in ashford the night before to catch the first train of the day at six twenty eight
S0368	oh right mm
S0252	but essentially the journey would be would be to paris and then there's a train from paris to milan on tgv
S0368	oh right
S0252	and then the italian
S0368	mm
S0252	eurostar service
S0368	but you'll go by plane will you
S0252	it's probably it's likely yes
S0368	mm
S0252	i might try the train go and the plane come back but
S0368	mm
S0252	i'm i think the train both ways would be just a bite tricky because
S0368	mm
S0252	some sad reason really there seem to be a bite of tension between the french railway operator and the italian railway operator
S0368	oh yeah
S0252	so it mean the italian railway operator have give er the french their er operator very poor slot
S0368	oh yeah
S0252	so it's
S0368	mm
S0252	just hasn't
S0368	mm bite tricky
S0252	not too good i'm afraid
S0368	mm
S0252	and only three service a day as well so
S0368	oh yeah mm
S0252	but it do take seven hours and two minutes
S0368	do it
S0252	yes
S0368	yeah
S0252	paris to milan
S0368	mm
S0252	but it can only go about twenty miles per hour in the alps because it's
S0368	oh yeah
S0252	such a steep gradient
S0368	yes mm mm so what be you go to see this time
S0252	well i'm hop to erm just spend about two of the well three nights in florence
S0368	mm
S0252	because we didn't see the boboli garden
S0368	mm
S0252	and i mean how far i'd like go south the vasari corridor and the pitti palace
S0368	oh yes
S0252	yes er so that would be the days er
S0368	mm
S0252	and then it's basically just see little smaller sit
S0368	mm
S0252	in the countryside and er tuscany and umbria
S0368	mm
S0252	and er probably the first stop would be arezzo erm and then probably move towards the east coast
S0368	uhu
S0252	er could be er city erm let's move a bite south assisi er
S0368	be there
S0252	that's
S0368	yeah mm
S0252	south a like a little river in the middle so we'd go on in there and then maybe to siena and look at
S0368	mm be you look forward to this then
S0251	mm
S0368	as much as that
S0252	i think mum be a bite shy
S0251	yeah
S0369	we do seven cities there didn't we
S0368	yes we do yes
S0369	mm
S0252	seven
S0369	we do seven cities
S0252	seven cities yes
S0369	in italy on our trip we do i remember this er florence
S0252	yes
S0369	siena er venice
S0252	yes
S0369	verona
S0252	mm
S0369	san gimignano
S0252	san
S0369	assisi
S0252	rome presumably
S0369	rome
S0252	yes
S0369	mm
S0252	er well you must have start right in the very north
S0369	certainly wander around didn't we
S0368	mm
S0252	yes that's good
S0368	mm
S0368	we saw some wonder things didn't we
S0369	we do mm
S0368	wonderful church and
S0369	mm
S0368	all sort mm
S0252	mm
S0368	anyway it's a good job we do them when we could
S0369	absolutely
S0368	mm
S0369	mm
S0252	something to think about
S0368	mm
S0368	mm
S0368	mm
S0252	one thing be er hope er if we do fly it will be from luton and that's not easy to get to from
S0369	mm
S0252	this area i know it's north london
S0368	oh right
S0368	it's not really properly connect
S0368	on isn't it
S0252	with any train or bus or anything
S0368	oh how would you do it then
S0252	well probably take the train to
S0368	yeah
S0252	take a train from to then it's nine miles from so probably take a taxi for those last nine miles
S0369	to where
S0252	to
S0368	luton
S0252	luton airport
S0369	luton airport mm
S0368	mm and then would you have to stay the night there or would you get on a plane
S0252	er hopefully just the flight time be go to be sensible er
S0368	oh
S0252	should be able to do it in that same morning
S0368	oh right that's good yeah
S0252	i've plan because it just make the holiday a good couple of hundred more if you have those
S0368	yeah
S0252	airport hotel stay
S0369	mm
S0368	oh yes
S0369	mm
S0368	yeah
S0369	yeah you soon clock up doesn't it
S0252	yeah
S0369	mm
S0252	but if it be the eurostar we would need a night in ashford the night before
S0368	oh would you mm
S0252	it could be london the advantage of ashford be that you can get up a little bite later because the train's get to travel from london to ashford
S0368	oh yeah yeah
S0252	so that just give you an extra i think it's forty eight minutes er
S0368	mm
S0252	it's worth have definitely
S0368	mm it be in the morning yes cos you've get to get pack up again haven't you
S0252	i know so if it's six twenty eight you need half an hour check in so you'd need to be there at five fifty and then you need to leave the hotel
S0368	mm
S0252	twenty minutes so it would be five thirty
S0368	yeah
S0252	so you'd probably have to get up at five
S0368	mm
S0368	mm yes and you get tire travel don't you
S0252	yes
S0368	yeah so
S0252	it's a shame because it would technically be possible to do to france in the same day but because if they sort of the connections don't work
S0368	no no they don't
S0252	no
S0368	work in with each other
S0252	no
S0368	no
S0252	the last train of the day from milan leave about twenty minutes before the paris train arrive
S0368	oh that's bad organisation
S0252	it be
S0368	yeah be you wash up
S0251	yeah
S0368	okay
S0368	oh right speedy gonzales

S0368	oh
S0251	but will they have any porky pies
S0252	i don't know

S0252	particular time on the er guinness world record for the longest hog roast and they have about fifty hog roast in the
S0368	oh
S0368	yeah unusual

S0251	mm and leathery
S0368	apart from that though
S0251	fatty
S0368	oh
S0251	spicy
S0368	yeah
S0251	well not too much to recommend it

S0251	thinly
