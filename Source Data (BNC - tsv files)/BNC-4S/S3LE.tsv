S0337	it's not dubai or erm
S0343	the reason why they pay you well be because

S0342	it's cool
S0336	you haven't really have much chance to travel though have you i suppose

S0337	it's it's not like abu dhabi or anything like saudi arabia i mean i mean erm dubai saudi arabia
S0337	be just like strict and desert and
S0343	and they still they still chop people's head off
S0337	head off yeah
S0343	in the street
S0342	yeah that's we can go and watch one one night can't we
S0343	apparently if you you don't wanna ever be anywhere near them erm when you're it's normally it's normally on a friday after they do prayer on a friday it's their friday be our saturday and they all go a bite mad after prayer on the friday afternoon and they come out of prayer that's when they have these public public display of discipline
S0337	yeah
S0343	so westerners westerners just stay stay well away because apparently like if you've be pinch and the and the penalty for that be to have your hand
S0337	your hand chop off yeah
S0343	your hand chop off er apparently it's far more embarrass for the person and his family or her family if it's witness by westerners
S0337	yeah
S0343	so if you're if you're anywhere anywhere near all of sudden there'll be a lot of the people who be behind you push you to the front even if you don't wanna be there

S0343	so people just yeah
S0337	stay away yeah
S0343	obviously the guy that be there that be run it they just know the place not to be and the time not not to be there
S0337	there be something on erm it be the daily mail but like the stories seem pretty true obviously slightly different it's it's isis do it but they chuck some guy off a erm off like a tower block and he didn't die from it so they go and and they start stone him to death after he's survive that fall and it's just like it's that's pretty brutal
S0342	yeah
S0343	they put
S0337	yeah
S0343	some guy in a cage and set him on fire
S0337	yeah
S0343	it's er in jordan

S0337	yeah you don't want your hand chop off do you
S0343	well there's all the all the top execs that i i mean they all drink it
S0337	yeah
S0343	so it's not like it's it's
S0337	no
S0343	cos it's inside the wire it's
S0342	but like you say there's golf course and stuff like that so there must be some stuff
S0343	if you
S0342	to do in like social time do you know what i mean there must be place to go to to do stuff
S0336	you there's a there'll be a gym and a pool and all that sort of stuff

S0337	yeah
S0343	that's it and shop
S0337	yeah
S0343	could because riyadh's the capital it's just like go to london
S0336	yeah
S0343	i suppose just different rule everything shut down on a regular basis cos it cos they pray like
S0336	prayers yeah
S0343	they pray like five time a day so you could be you could be like go in a shop to you're want to pay and sorry it's all the shutter come down and that's you're out
S0343	but then but then cos they shut at all weird time during the day they stay open till like midnight so like you can get a their version of be you can shop at like eleven or twelve at night
S0337	yeah yeah it's weird isn't it
S0343	they've get they've get mcdonald's you know there's a mcdonald's there right
S0337	it'll be like fuck me be no pork or anything there's no
S0343	no they don't do pork
S0337	pork no
S0336	no bacon
S0343	there's no pork and no booze that's it

S0342	yeah it's like pork
S0337	cos
S0342	pork yeah
S0337	erm pig be see as dirty animals so erm
S0342	aren't they maybe
S0337	choose
S0342	aren't they maybe really mean to be like one of the most hygienic
S0337	yeah but they're always see as like you chuck in your waste and they eat that so jews and muslims don't eat pork erm hindus don't eat beef cos
S0336	cow be sacred
S0337	cow be sacred erm i don't know anything else er buddhists don't eat meat because animals be live
S0336	god's creatures
S0337	yeah

S0337	that that's like
S0342	that's like the
S0337	beyond beyond like that law like that's take like like the koran like word for word for certain things erm it's like i think they
S0336	that's
S0337	pick and choose
S0336	yeah
S0337	that's that's the extreme side

S0336	especially like the
S0342	just because you're never out
S0336	no i never go out although they don't go out as much as they use to
S0337	saw a lot of for a while didn't you
S0336	so er yeah
S0342	she still snapchats me sometimes
S0336	yeah i really can't work out what she's be do she she drop me a text message every now again it's just a bite weird
S0342	what have you just like give up on her now
S0336	a little bite in as much as like i i feel like i do as much as i can but
S0342	you need to let her get on with what she want to do
S0336	yeah there's only so much you can do like
S0342	yeah
S0336	you have to let people help themselves
S0342	when you're younger as well you have more time for your friends don't you and then you get busier when you're older don't you
S0336	if if i honestly like if she need my help i'd be there but like i offer her a lot of help last year and like she just just she just doesn't take anybody's advice and like she's be to see so many doctor and her parent have do so much for her and she still she still fight it erm my friend er you've you've probably meet her a few time she's like erm you know my twenty first and they both give a speech
S0343	yeah yeah
S0336	yeah erm for a while everybody think she be like bipolar erm she start have like a few mental problems erm so like she'd have these periods of be like super high on life and like do like just outrageous things like she'd go to london and blow like three grand on her credit card like buy like bottle of moët and like stay in expensive hotels and then but you'd be like like like what even be that and then she'd come home break and like crash because like i dunno like she
S0342	all her money have go
S0336	yeah and like because i dunno the realisation that like you know that's not her life like
S0342	yeah
S0336	i dunno like she be always like chase this like extreme version of her life like she always want to be she always want to be have adventure and be do excite things and be do things that people would wanna talk about
S0342	yeah
S0336	but that's not life you can't live your entire life be that person like
S0342	yeah
S0336	and like so she'd go she'd go through these like months of be like really high and all over the place and just do like outrageous ridiculous things and then she'd kind of crash completely and go completely in herself
S0343	yeah yeah
S0336	and wouldn't talk to anyone and would be feel like really low and really down
S0343	yeah
S0336	it's like i mean major extremes like
S0342	bloody hell
S0336	and like i witness it for a couple of years and didn't like be there when she need me but it's really hard to be there for someone
S0343	oh no yeah
S0336	like that because
S0343	it be
S0336	like
S0342	yeah
S0336	you know when when she be feel high i wasn't fun enough for her and then when she's feel low she doesn't wanna talk to anyone so it take a lot for her to like ever make contact with me she have to be she have to be feel fairly normal basically
S0342	yeah
S0336	to make any contact with me but then even like i have me and would go round for dinner with her and you'd sit there and like no word of a lie like she's just in cuckoo land like i've i've come for dinner with her and it's and she's tell me about how she's write a manifesto to send to the prime minister and like just the most ridiculous stuff
S0336	like and you've get to sit there and you're kind of like
S0343	mm mm mm
S0336	yeah
S0342	soon as you say that dad be just like
S0336	yeah like and like you're listen to her like and you know she's tell me like she text me
S0342	yeah
S0336	i've get a new boyfriend right tell me about him oh well i've only meet him two days ago
S0343	david beckham
S0336	but like you know like no he's not your boyfriend then if you've meet him two days ago oh well i've just get a new like the best one she tell me she she'd just get this new job in london and like she pack her bag and move down to london and then as far as i could tell she be essentially like crash at some guy's place who like she'd just meet and then like go out to like london coffee place and just like talk to random people like oh it's just like and it's just
S0343	it's really sad isn't it
S0336	it be really sad and like as her friend like it's really really difficult cos you'd sit and talk to her
S0337	could i have some ketchup please
S0343	cos at your do she at your do she she be perfectly
S0336	yeah she be fine and i and i i mean it be
S0343	probably one of the
S0336	it be probably the year after that where it get really bad i start to notice that she have to be i mean it even from a young age she she enjoy be the centre of attention she enjoy she enjoy kind of
S0337	stories something to talk about
S0336	yeah she enjoy
S0343	bite like i mean 's exactly the same
S0336	yeah she enjoy be that person and then what seem to happen be that as everybody get a bite older and everybody's attention shift she really struggle to deal with like what be like normal life like it almost just wasn't interest enough for her
S0342	too bore
S0336	yeah and she really struggle to deal with that and it be really weird and like like i say there be periods where i know she be really low but there's nothing you can do about it except be there when she want you to talk to her
S0342	i know but you can you can feel that way but just not for a prolong period of time like hers do you know what i mean
S0336	yeah
S0342	like everyone get that feel where you don't sort of think that everything be crack up
S0336	yeah
S0342	what you think it would be do you know what i mean
S0336	exactly
S0342	like
S0336	but it be just and it be just to a such extreme level like everybody's be er most people have be a little bite depress or a little bite sad or a little bite just like contemplative and think like oh this isn't what i be expect
S0342	yeah yeah
S0336	but like no like but hers be just so like i mean when she be low she be like manic depressive low like she be she be hurt herself and just get herself into really bad situations and then like i mean and she be like kick off at her parent and she be be like she have just so many destructive behaviours like she do a couple er well actually not that long ago about this time last year she start a blog and like no word of lie like it become like she be try so hard to be like kind of outrageous and to grab people's attention but like what she be effectively do be just like out a load of people a load of people that be mean to have be her friends like she be just like name and sham them on this blog and i mean it be the talk of like she really do get everybody's attention because these stories be just like outrageous like like i would not have let you read them because like like the stuff that she get up to and like that she'd openly write on this blog and then like but like she be she also go through a phase and i i i don't wanna say that it's not true because i don't know but she go through a phase of claim that her ex boyfriend use to beat her
S0342	right what and she be write about it
S0336	and she be write about it yeah for like public kind of consumption but like everybody who be around her at the time that she be claim this happen basically turn round and say like like i'd be really sad if it be true i just don't see how it could be because you know like he like he's just a he wasn't that kind of person and b she have so many people who be around her at that phase of her life that they would have notice
S0342	yeah
S0336	and so like all she be do be like try to be like it be defamation of character like so he end up have to call her parent threaten to call the police actually if basically cos she be just the kind of stuff she be say it be so
S0342	so bad so yeah
S0336	yeah it be terrible and so her parent kick off but like you know her parent keep ship her off to like various family members for like weeks at a time and it's just they clearly as a family just don't know how to
S0337	can't cope
S0336	deal with it yeah
S0343	must be a nightmare
S0336	it's really strange like she's as far as she can tell she's in her final year at uni now but it's take her like six seven years to do a three year course because like she'll get halfway through a year and then off or it's just it's just crazy but like
S0342	it's a bite of a shame isn't it
S0336	it be such a shame and it's really sad cos you can't but the thing be it it it be i i go out of my way not to ignore her but i just don't get i don't make the first contact with her because
S0337	cos you can't entertain her
S0336	no and i mean dad she send me poems and stuff like all the time like and and prose and it's just like it's how i i just don't even know it's just it's the ramble of a mad woman and like she ask me for feedback on her work and just like really like
S0336	what be i mean to say to this like
S0343	what have she actually make this stuff up
S0336	yeah she's like she's get get really into her creative write and like i don't ever wanna give her negative feedback because it's obviously prove a very valuable like outlet for her like she for her to like write her feel down and stuff but i just think christ like the stuff like everything she have to do be overly promiscuous and overly sexual and just quite dark as well and i'm just like this be like
S0336	this be
S0337	she's still out to shock
S0336	yeah and she like
S0337	you can't entertain her
S0336	everything she do be just like it's for the shock factor and it's just like it's really hard work so i just stay out of it the last time i speak to her she be do well at uni she tell me she might move to canada when she finish she say she have a boyfriend who work for a bank which sound all fairly normal but she's claim she's have boyfriends in the past and they've not really be boyfriends so i don't really know
S0343	what's she do at uni
S0336	erm i think she's do english literature she be do international relations at first but then she swap so i think she's do english light but and then it's really awkward cos every time she ask me how i be it's like well i'm
S0337	cheer thank yeah
S0336	i'm pretty good it's a bite awkward like
S0343	thank you mate that be
S0342	cheer that be good cheer
S0343	yeah it be good
S0336	i haven't even i haven't really i haven't tell her where i live now or anything cos like she go through a period of just turn up at my house and i mean like
S0343	what your house in
S0336	yeah she's turn
S0337	no
S0336	in
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah she's turn up before and i've not be in and she's bend mum's ear for an hour and it's just like mum didn't mind cos she didn't have to put up with it that often she be just like yeah i can kind of see what you you're say now i've see it firsthand but she get into like at one point last year she be she tell she tell me and that we have to be in this pantomime that she be set up she be write this like take on peter pan
S0343	well that's
S0336	that she be gonna put on at the rugby club in then she be gonna put it on at school she have a meet with mr and tell her that me and be involve start publicise the event she start go round local businesses in ask them for prize for a a raffle she be gonna host in the interval
S0342	what and then nothing ever happen
S0337	nothing ever happen
S0343	just a fantasist
S0336	it's really weird really weird and then like after all that like for years and years and years she be go back and forth to the doctor they they be really struggle to diagnose anything i mean i know it's hard to diagnose the mental stuff anyway but then in the end she be like oh well they just say that you know erm it's just psychotic behaviour bring on by an overuse of drink and drug great like then it's hard to feel sorry for someone when they say that to you then
S0342	yeah
S0336	like you can't help but feel sorry for someone who's bipolar and then can't really control it if someone tell you oh you know
S0343	that'll be
S0342	but in a way that's cause her to like become
S0336	oh yeah
S0342	have bipolar personality
S0336	it's just it's so hard to keep up it's tire like the last time me and saw her properly we'd be round her house for the friday night and we'd literally just pop in to say goodbye cos she tell us she be go to london but she's do that load and erm she then suddenly get really paranoid that somebody be that be gonna start steal her stuff but her stuff be in the garage which i didn't really understand so she make me and help her move everything from the garage into the house so that she could lock everything in the house so that didn't steal stuff from her
S0342	why would wanna steal her stuff
S0336	i dunno but she be convince that have be steal from her all her life it be really fuck weird and me and haven't haven't see her since
S0342	yeah have tell me her her side of that story as well it's really
S0336	come off really bad on that i mean
S0343	be what friend or her sister

S0342	wake the fucker
S0343	what's that all about
S0343	but yeah that be er that be one of those experience we've all have them
S0336	they're character build
S0343	the old the old like what be i do here
S0337	how be i here
S0336	like it be weird though
S0337	mm
S0336	cos like even like that night when i be in germany like i felt totally overwhelm in as much as like it have be a it have be a bite of a weird day but like i be also kind of like quite excite to be there and like even when i be go round dusseldorf i think i keep think like oh i really wanna come back here like do it properly
S0343	thing be you be leave
S0336	i'd love to go back to germany
S0343	to be all on your own and to be leave to your own devices on your own it's not fun
S0337	no
S0343	you you you can't do that to people doesn't matter how especially somebody your age
S0336	that i really do feel my age as well
S0342	to survive off their own back you're not travel you're there for a for a job aren't you
S0336	yeah like you know
S0343	probably most people at the conference
S0336	yeah
S0343	be probably there in twos and threes
S0336	exactly
S0343	and there be you on your
S0337	and have accommodation next to next to it
S0343	yeah
S0336	yeah you'd wouldn't you
S0337	not somewhere in a village
S0336	and like it be also it be also the fact that you know like if i go like if i go away with work now there's so many form i'd have to fill in and they'd want a copy of my itinerary they'd wanna know where i be plan to be and when i be plan to be there so that if they ever
S0342	do you like to speak to the person who have plan your your travel that weekend then
S0336	well the thing be i plan most of it i just i didn't plan the accommodation because when i originally look i say oh it might not be worth it because i can't find any accommodation less than i think it be like a hundred and fifty pound for like one night erm and then like i think who one of them email me back like oh how about this and like i do a i do a really brief like look at the website and i be like oh it doesn't look atrocious but obviously didn't pay any attention to like where the hell it be locate
S0337	didn't they spend more on like get you there in taxis and stuff wouldn't it have work out the same if they'd put you somewhere close by
S0342	cos you have to fork out for all your bus and
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0342	everything like that
S0336	well i erm
S0337	you have to pay for it and they pay you pack
S0336	yeah although i think she actually give me a float
S0336	i think yeah
S0343	do any of your previous german speak come do you remember any of it
S0336	erm some of it i tend to just say like then
S0343	well there you go
S0336	and
S0336	and then they go oh okay
S0343	yeah
S0336	and they can tell that you're try like i i think
S0342	what what's that
S0336	no so i only speak only a bite of german
S0343	i only speak i i only speak a little german and and that mean that's about all
S0343	don't ask what i can say
S0336	i can i can i can give directions like
S0342	what's
S0336	around the corner
S0342	around the corner
S0336	erm and so i can do the important stuff i can order food and i can order drink
S0343	that's
S0336	i could i can actually understand it a lot better than i can speak it so if a german person i mean they'd have to slow down they couldn't talk in like normal german pace but like if they be speak to me i would have a semi good chance at decipher what it be that they be try to tell me
S0343	when we live in
S0343	when we live in for a couple of years
S0337	yeah yeah
S0343	we have er birthday party for these two the house would be full of bavarian kid
S0337	yeah german kid
S0343	these these two they'd be there all this in bavarian and they'd talk to me all or or call me in perfect english
S0343	and everything and if they be outside in the garden and the next door neighbour be out in their garden they'd talk over the fence in perfect bavarian to her and then if they speak to me i didn't understand a word
S0343	and then would say do you want me to tell you what you say or do you want me to tell you what she just say and be out in the supermarket with and they bump into 's school friends and the two girls would be chat and so of course the girl's mum would start talk to in bavarian think that she obviously understand every word and your mum be she's alright she's she's quite
S0337	she's yeah
S0343	she's quite good she's not not great
S0337	yeah
S0343	but then on the way home like on the way home from the supermarket would say do you want me to tell you what she say
S0336	mum say she use to get annoy cos like
S0336	she be obviously try to practise her german as well
S0336	but i'd always butt in and be like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
S0342	yeah
S0343	and you be pretty good as well
S0342	what at german
S0343	yeah yeah
S0336	she be say mum tell me that erm when i start big school like one of the first report i get back be that i be the best
S0343	german german leader

S0343	she be the best
S0342	yeah
S0343	the best

S0342	thank very much
S0336	well me and do like twenty odd and it wasn't
S0343	couldn't bother you for another coke could i
S0337	er just ice please
S0337	cheer
S0336	thank you oh that look so good
S0342	this look beautiful
S0336	erm
S0342	that's a physalis
S0343	a what
S0342	a physalis
S0343	they be quite nice haven't get a i haven't get a clue what they be but they be quite nice
S0336	erm
S0336	i've see a really cool bike ride that i've want to do for age but you have to raise quite a lot of money to do it and that's the amazon to the andes
S0337	oh nice
S0336	erm but
S0337	do you just like put down like a grand first or something or three grand or something stupid
S0336	you have to you have to commit to raise about that yeah
S0336	but if you er obviously if you say like a year in advance you should be able to raise that money but yeah i always think that would be really good fun
S0342	yeah that would be awesome
S0337	would you have to raise the money and have er like a down payment
S0336	you'd put down a deposit and it wouldn't be a lot it would be like three hundred pound maybe and then
S0337	cos erm
S0336	and you can kind of you can commit to a you can pay for it as you can pay for as much of it as you like but obviously
S0337	it's how much you raise
S0336	yeah
S0337	cos erm 's do erm three peak with his hockey friends and they're play thirty three game of hockey three peak within i think ten days
S0342	bloody hell
S0337	yeah erm and he's have to go round and ask people for money before he's do it because they have to put a down payment on it and it's like sport hall hire or stuff like that
S0336	yeah
S0337	just to make sure that they they're good for it because people have be quite like not rude but like
S0337	cheer
S0337	yeah it's a good one thank
S0337	get quite obnoxious about the fact that he's ask for money upfront just like you'll no it's still gonna go to charity you can see why he need to do it
S0336	yeah but i'd also be like don't commit to do something if you can't afford to pay for it like the whole point of raise money cos otherwise that mean the money he's raise isn't actually go to raise money it's go to pay for him to raise money that doesn't really make sense
S0337	they've have it's the last one and it's still
S0343	i do i do apologise to most of you miss the we if you be if you be gonna watch the rugby i didn't realise there be gonna be a match on
S0342	i be in fact go to watch it yeah but anyway
S0336	i wasn't
S0342	by the sound of things we're now draw sixteen eight at halftime
S0343	what in ireland's favour no
S0342	sixteen eight to wales now after that cheer i would have think they would have just score a try so it be
S0336	these be really nice actually i've not have one of these that doesn't feel sickly this doesn't feel quite as sickly as some of the other ones
S0343	quite nice
S0336	mm
S0342	mm for some reason i be erm like er chocolate orange isn't as sickly as like just a normal chocolate
S0336	mm
S0342	brownie be it they they taste nice initially but the aftertaste isn't isn't too nice be it
S0343	what
S0342	those er those orange things there
S0343	oh yeah i'd never know it be physalis
S0336	if we be in i would
S0343	mm
S0342	probably mistake for syphilis
S0342	yeah me and er me and have be plan to go and see and in for the last month or two but the weather's be so shit that it so hasn't really help me out money wise but hopefully
S0336	no
S0342	i get can get four weeks work next week and do it that way so we're gonna go out on the friday night then go out and do some shop on the saturday
S0336	yeah
S0342	go out for some food and go and watch a film on the saturday night
S0336	that'll be good
S0342	and then just chill out on a sunday morning before drive back and i wanna like i wanna take enough money so you can do what you wanna do
S0336	you can actually enjoy it yeah
S0342	instead of be like restrict do you know what i mean but when the weather's like this you're only get like two or three days' work a week
S0336	yeah
S0342	and you've gotta pay mum the rent and your petrol and everything like that it's impossible to to save any money
S0336	yeah
S0342	so i'm just pray that i get five days next week so i can actually have some money to take with me
S0336	yeah that's yeah
S0342	otherwise there's no point in fuck go
S0337	will you work longer hours in the summer do you reckon
S0342	i've ask him by tomorrow
S0342	but he say he's get nothing for me that i can do
S0337	yeah
S0342	we're start his extension on monday he's er do an extension on his own house so we're gonna start that on monday because he's get job he's get job that he's price up and quote for but the customers don't wanna do them like so it's all just wait to be do it's never normally like this it normally just run like one job into the next
S0336	i be gonna say er i don't think it's obviously not a reflection on you it's to do with the fact that the the work's not there
S0342	obviously when the when the weather's shit as well they're bad enough organise organise the different job and the materials when the weather's good
S0336	yeah
S0342	but then when you have days where you don't even do anything then you've get to rearrange everything
S0336	yeah
S0342	especially if you're rely on deliveries or things to be drop off and like but but i always ask him if i can make it up make up for it on weekend and er work on a saturday or a sunday like when we've have shit weather or like whatever during the week but he like to go out fly his plan and shit on the weekend so
S0337	so what
S0342	he's get load of remote control plan and he fly para paramotors as well
S0337	really
S0342	which be basically a a rucksack with a giant desk fan on and it's get a a canopy like a parachute kind of thing
S0337	yeah
S0342	and you start the engine up
S0337	and then yeah
S0342	it's only like it's only like seventy five a seventy five er cc engine
S0337	just enough yeah
S0342	and it's just you only you only need the engine to take off
S0337	yeah
S0342	and you run along yank the cord and it push you up then once you're once you're in the air but you'd use it and you just lean back and then the engine like take you up and then as soon as you're up there you just like cut it out and just float around and it's and down
S0337	that sound pretty pretty cool
S0342	yeah
S0342	but they can go up to like five thousand feet
S0337	really bite bite nippy
S0342	yeah
S0337	up there and one gust of wind
S0342	it be
S0337	like go miles
S0342	he's so he's so cos it cos like there's load of like er jet and that that fly around there and he's like he's go and buy himself erm he's get his own paramotor now he's buy his own
S0336	lovely thank you
S0337	yeah it be nice
S0342	yeah it be brilliant
S0336	thank you very much
S0342	this er
S0342	this paramotor that he's buy be bright orange like with a fan on the back of it it's a bright orange blade on it and it's er this wing's bright orange as well he's like i'm not get hit
S0342	i'm not get hit by any of these jet
S0337	that would be a way to go though wouldn't it
S0342	he's get all the flight plan from round here though and there's like hardly anywhere that you can fly round here like if you er if you take into like it's get all the er it's get the base and it's there's like circle round all the all the base obviously like and and like the the various like army base they're obviously like no fly zone then you've get line the lanes that have get like blue arrows on them and they're for like commercial airliners and then there's like some sketchy little red arrows that be like just for like er private private jet and things like that and then when you actually look at what's leave there's like not very much room for like people who just wanna like fly their own fly their own plan up there there's not actually that much like free airspace do you know what i mean
S0343	yeah
S0342	so i don't think i don't think paramotoring would be very good to be do round here but
S0337	so what do like do
S0342	i've watch i've watch videos er well they i don't they obviously have to stick to some sort of path don't they you don't just
S0337	when er when it take them

S0342	the iconic tree
S0337	yeah
S0342	the rugby field tree
S0336	at road yeah they be fairly dangerous though
S0337	yeah
S0342	yeah if they if they go
S0336	if they fell the wrong way
S0342	if they get blow over those house would would have be destroy it's they must have block out so much sunlight to those house as well but
S0343	what next next to the have they all go be they
S0342	all those big ones that run along the road
S0336	and they be like
S0337	the the the they're chop half down halfway
S0336	yeah
S0342	and the orchard behind the astroturf have have go now
S0343	and and and the house on there
S0342	yeah
S0342	old people's home now the house
S0336	be it
S0343	be it
S0342	i mean there's some new build further on
S0336	there's load of house up there now
S0342	they all take they're all they're all the timber frame ones that they build at
S0336	yeah
S0342	i dunno i may be able to go over but like when whenever
S0336	yeah ours isn't timber frame so we feel really smug about that like every time i see the new house that the timber frame house go up like ha ha ha
S0343	yeah
S0337	they're pretty much they're flatpack house
S0336	yeah they're so crap like so many of my friends like who well i say so many like the friends that i know that have move into like those kind of house have so many problems like
S0337	huge crack and
S0336	huge crack like load of settle like pin come out like just
S0337	skirt board that don't fit doors
S0336	yeah
S0337	that don't fit
S0336	yeah doors that doors that warp like
S0342	it's because of the people that make the actual timber frame be like sixteen seventeen year year old like they don't don't get any train they're just right this be this be the er this be how they need to go together
S0336	but do you know what like even on our site like the people i see walk around like i mean the site
S0337	young
S0336	the site managers be clearly like clue up they know exactly what they're do but like joe bloggs who's do the paint and rat or whatever he's get clearly not get a great deal of like experience or qualification like i mean a paint job in our house like some of the some of like some of the windowsills like he's clearly paint and then put his fuck elbow on it and you're just like really like
S0337	yeah
S0342	yeah idiot
S0336	and there's like there's some some of the bits like you know like we've get a radiator on the in the on the land and they've just not paint underneath it like really and like load of them like you can take the radiator off like that just to like
S0342	well they do
S0336	get behind
S0342	yeah
S0336	so it but like they've not bother paint
S0343	behind
S0336	and it just
S0337	so why wouldn't you do it first
S0336	but why wouldn't yeah you
S0337	or just paint the house and then do everything afterwards
S0336	you you'd paint the house and then you'd fix
S0337	and then then
S0336	the way the
S0337	touch it up if it need it
S0343	no i know just cash
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah they cut
S0337	it's terrible
S0336	they do cut corner in that respect
S0342	everything be just rush isn't it
S0337	yeah
S0336	but yeah
S0342	erm but they won't be they they won't be very that well organise where they've
S0337	no
S0342	get their house go together like in stag
S0336	yeah
S0342	and then they have people go from one to one to one how it should be
S0336	problem be yeah well that's the thing the problem be the way they sell it be that they kind of like they they they they they release a batch of house and then they'll put those that batch of house will sell at at different stag so like i dunno one plot might go straightaway but then they might have one plot like ours that be straggle towards the end so what you've get be a batch of house that kind of need to go up at the same time but be buy at different time so part of your build be delay like if you're wait for information from a customer or like or kind of you're just delay cos you don't wanna don't
S0337	and they don't have painters onsite like
S0336	no
S0337	all the time so they have to get them in
S0342	yeah
S0336	yeah and like the like
S0337	so they rush a load
S0342	it's more money
S0337	of house and they get them up yeah
S0336	windows and doors people only ever come in on a friday for example and like the landscapers will only come in when there's a job to be do and stuff like that like and they obviously
S0337	yeah
S0336	have other contract it's just it's like as a site manager it must be really difficult but yeah like the
S0337	i i can't really complain we've we've do
S0336	we've do really really well
S0337	well
S0336	and actually if if if all i can complain about be the paint

S0337	i've take the friday off
S0336	it's kind of the rock 'n' roll life i lead and we're finally get some blind for the hall like the land so we'll actually have some we'll have complete privacy then there'll be
S0337	at the front yeah
S0336	curtain everywhere which will be good but they've cost us a small fortune haven't they
S0337	curtain cost a lot don't they like there's nothing you can do to avoid it unless you go and buy curtain that don't fit they cost a lot
S0336	yeah
S0337	i hate it
S0337	really hate it
S0336	like there's those like i don't know if you can remember but like on the land we've get like a really tall skinny window
S0337	on the stairs
S0336	and then like a short fat window
S0343	yeah yeah
S0337	yeah
S0336	so like try to if i'm like and i want them to match obviously cos they're on the same wall like they've kind of get a match but like try to find any sort of blind to fit those windows no chance
S0337	it just doesn't
S0336	it doesn't work
S0337	they don't exist
S0336	no
S0343	no
S0337	but we have obviously we have the guy from do the front bedroom and he he be cheap and well he wasn't it wasn't actually cheap be it everything cost money like
S0343	yeah
S0337	it have to be tailor make to the window it's gotta fit the window and yeah he he he do us a good job there
S0336	yeah
S0343	mm
S0337	but these like we've get we've we've order some roman blind so they've obviously get like you've get to pay for the fabric pay for the line pay for the the manufacture and then you've get to pay for the fit as well so i mean he do us a bite of a deal but even so like it's cost us a small fortune
S0337	we get them
S0343	yeah
S0336	get them in the sale and get some money off
S0336	but i just keep think like mum just keep tell me like i know it feel like you're plough money in but just keep do it because you'll get to a point where you go we're do
S0337	yeah
S0336	and then you can sit back and you can go right we don't have to worry about anything now for a little while
S0343	yeah
S0336	which be
S0337	but if you look at the room
S0336	we're get there
S0337	they're all fill up
S0336	yeah
S0337	they're all basically do
S0336	we're get there
S0343	rome wasn't build in a day be it
S0337	no it wasn't
S0343	you know what i mean it all take time
S0336	it's and i i'm actually start to enjoy it now when we first move in i feel i felt stress about it all
S0337	yeah
S0336	cos we be try to do too much too quickly i'm enjoy it now cos we're do like a little bite as and when we can actually afford to do it
S0337	yeah
S0343	and you will get to the point where you don't need to spend anymore money
S0337	no
S0336	yeah it be nice and like we've just like even to the point where like we've start put a few bits and piece on the wall and it really do make a difference doesn't it
S0337	oh yeah put picture on the wall
S0336	yeah
S0337	we've get some up in the guest bedroom so some up in the downstairs toilet er front bedroom on the
S0336	it do make a difference doesn't it
S0337	there's stuff order for the the land or be that
S0336	oh i haven't order that yet but yeah
S0337	yeah and then it'll fill up and then it'll look live in
S0343	fantastic
S0337	yeah
S0336	we've get plan for the for the hallway so like we'll have to paint it
S0337	yeah
S0336	before i wanna paint it before the blind go up cos it'll just be a bite of a faff to try and paint around the blind and then as and when we can afford to we'll get that wall wallpaper
S0337	that'll be alright i think that'll be a matter of find
S0336	there's no rush for that
S0337	someone to do it
S0336	yeah i know
S0337	as oppose to do it
S0336	i know
S0337	that's the problem like obviously 's do the feature wall in your lounge but to find someone to just do a wall it's like it's kind of not worth their time whereas when you have the decorators in that do the that er the the stairs they be do load of other things but you ask them just to do one wall like it's almost not worth their time
S0336	they do charge you like they do charge you like the whole day even if it might take them like a few hours
S0337	yeah
S0336	because they're not gonna fit in another job
S0337	yeah it's awkward
S0336	it's like it's like i've be try to find a plumber to come and do our erm
S0337	radiator
S0336	radiator in the en suite like we've buy like a towel radiator so we want someone to come in drain the exist radiator and hopefully take it away and then fit the new one but like try to find a local plumber to do like i mean that's that'll take them an hour if that like it's not a big job but try to convince someone to come and do it it's really hard
S0337	i might give that a go on sunday
S0337	yeah i know but
S0336	i mean go for it but
S0337	i've get the spanners now
S0336	yeah
S0337	that's why i couldn't do it last time i didn't have spanners
S0336	i know i'm just scar about the valves but like go for it
S0343	if you want if you want the name or the number of the guy that i use
S0337	yeah
S0343	to fit our boiler and do some plumb job for us he's an irish an irish guy call er and he's very nice
S0343	er and he'll come er and i if i ask him he'll come and do it for you
S0336	yeah cos it i do
S0343	he he operate from but he's a nice he's a good he's a good guy
S0336	i ring a guy i ring well i er i email a guy from that i find online and he ring me at the begin of the week and he be just like oh like can i come and have a look and i like oh i'll make sure you've get all the bits that you need and i'll give you like a a price depend on like you know how big the job look et cetera et cetera i be like yeah yeah that's absolutely fine he's like so like you know when when would be best i'm like well both me and my partner we're at work all day so it will have to be in the even he's like oh yeah evening's fine erm half expect him to say like oh i'll come by on like x even or whatever and he be like okay well i'll give you a ring at some point in the week before i head over just to make sure you're in cos that's convenient
S0337	couldn't he have just say thursday
S0336	yeah
S0337	thursday at seven can you
S0336	so he's not be needle to say so
S0343	do you want me to have a word with somebody
S0343	or or the
S0336	it need do
S0337	yeah it's just sit there for a few weeks isn't it
S0336	it's be there since before christmas
S0343	and if you want that if you want that wall do just let me know and i'll i'll get somebody to give you a call
S0336	yeah pass on pass on whoever's detail yeah cos we don't know we don't know any local people yet and it's really hard really hard cos you just don't know who to trust like look online
S0343	so what so what plumb do you want
S0336	literally just a
S0337	just a radiator
S0336	heat towel rail
S0337	so we've get
S0343	out of your bathroom
S0337	the radiator yeah
S0336	yeah it be
S0343	the en suite so
S0337	it should be so easy
S0343	so take a radiator out
S0336	take a radiator off and put in
S0337	they can have they can have that radiator and they can sell that and they can use that like
S0336	it's brand new
S0337	it's brand new
S0336	erm but yeah we just want we want a heat towel rail put up in its place
S0337	all they have to do be like drill into the wall i've get a drill they can use my drill
S0337	erm
S0336	i don't think a plumber would need your tool though
S0337	i've never use it so
S0343	yeah
S0337	yeah and just stick it on the wall plumb it in job do
S0336	it's not a big job
S0337	i could do it
S0336	i don't think
S0337	but
S0336	and like
S0343	leave it to me
S0336	and and the the radiator people send us the valves send them so i dunno should be fine
S0343	leave it to me i'll get somebody to call you
S0336	that would be good thank you oh dear
S0337	it's the little job like that that we don't have we don't have anyone with with like a skill or a trade i mean be probably our nearest
S0336	yeah
S0337	contact with a in a trade

S0337	it's quite bad
S0343	see our bath be one of those that stand up
S0337	yeah
S0343	it's a free stand and it
S0337	you've get a really nice bath

S0343	yeah i must admit we we don't have a bath very often cos it
S0337	it's effort isn't it
S0343	er and it's a faff if you haven't get like decent hot water that fly out the tap you know and you can you can run a bath in like a couple of minutes get in it job do our bath because we've get a combi boiler
S0337	yeah
S0343	you've gotta have the water trickle out for it to be pip hot
S0337	stay hot
S0343	soon as you add a bite of speed onto the hot tap it just go lukewarm
S0337	yeah that's it
S0343	so you end up so you've gotta run it like just drip in so like
S0343	i'll have a bath in three hours when the bath's full
S0337	i've i've not be in a house with hot water as good as ours to be honest our hot water's on like two hours a day and we've always get hot water
S0343	plenty of it
S0336	yeah
S0337	plenty of it yeah

S0337	keep it warm yeah
S0336	keep the water warm
S0343	it's good
S0336	anyway but yeah like it it's a massive waste i can never run a bath and like i
S0343	that's it
S0336	like a bath for me like you know if i've if i've have a really like stressful day it be the one thing that'll really like calm me down and i can't have one it's really annoy

S0343	it be leak out
S0336	yeah and i'm think i'm pay for a load of fuel here that i don't think i need so i get in my car and everything and i've be drive for the last few days like not really i hadn't really look into it but i look at my manual today and apparently my fuel tank my fuel be fifty five

S0336	i end up pay like fifty seven pound so i be like i haven't pay that for fuel for a long time
S0343	but you will do you you
S0336	and i be like what be that
S0343	you will get a lot of miles out of it
S0336	well yeah cos like erm obviously that wasn't even it turn a a full tank and erm they when i turn the car on the range say seven hundred miles i'm like if i can do seven hundred miles out of a tank i'll be well chuff
S0337	mm do you reckon you will
S0336	erm yeah well i've do two hundred miles so far and it's only go down to five hundred and sixty eight so i've get a good chance
S0337	happy if i do five hundred but i'm do town drive and like i say i pull away from light a bite quick and
S0336	yeah
S0337	you're always try to get somewhere quick and you don't you don't drive sensibly
S0336	but that's i i could be drive like i i get up to about fifty seven point five miles per gallon and i haven't be able to get it much higher than that it take an absolute batter today like
S0337	do you
S0336	sit in that traffic yeah erm so i'm down to like about fifty six point four or something now
S0337	all you have to do be just lift your foot off the clutch don't touch the accelerator at all
S0336	well it's hard when like i be on the slip road when i be stick for like half an hour
S0343	nightmare
S0336	great so i'm like on this bloom slip road try to join the a14 cos i tend to like there's this bite or like as you go past and like there's like a bridge and like i don't know if you i don't know how well you know like there's erm it's the there's a big like co op or like distribution on the right hand side and like like there's always traffic stop there and i always tend to come off at the a14 and go down and then come back up the other side cos you do cut out like a big chunk of the traffic normally
S0336	so i do that this morning think i be be a smartarse but obviously didn't realise that it be accident traffic as oppose to congestion
S0337	so you just well yeah yeah i know
S0336	so i just hit traffic the other side on the slip road
S0343	and you sit there forever
S0336	sit there for half an hour
S0337	never hear of a road that's get so many accidents on
S0343	oh the a14 be a nightmare
S0337	breakdowns
S0343	a14 be a killer always have be
S0337	what yeah what be it
S0336	they're like it's just like even my time this week's be so bad cos like so this morning i have to i have to be in work for half past eight cos we have we have a big seminar on all day and erm so i i set off this morning just after half past six which should have be absolutely plenty of time but then because there be an accident on the a14 i didn't hit then till eight o'clock try to get through at eight o'clock i've get absolutely no chance like between between about eight and quarter past half past nine like you cannot get through so as soon as i get as soon as i hit traffic then on the way it delay me get to and then i hit all the traffic in as well so i get to by about ten to eight but i still didn't get into work till half past eight and then tonight to
S0337	it's so bad it's so
S0336	i i set off at four o'clock it take me half an hour to get through so i get onto the m11 at half past four and i be i be back into then for five o'clock i be in at five o'clock and it still take me till half past five to get to our house
S0337	be bad today it's so
S0336	it's so depress like i hit it both end i can't do anything about it
S0337	and the the road in between be one of the worst roads
S0336	it's shit yeah
S0337	yeah
S0336	i get and i like even like even try to get out of sometimes like try to get to at the moment be a nightmare cos of all the roadworks so i try to go through but then cos obviously a lot of people be try to go through you end up
S0343	that
S0336	queue to go through as well
S0343	that fill up as well yeah and i always go way and sometimes it's a
S0336	yeah and this i i like the the last few weeks i've just nothing i've do have work like you know when you're like
S0343	yeah
S0336	you're try your hardest and i be late for work yesterday and i set off at half past eight and get in at ten past ten it's annoy and then you feel shit cos then you be actually late for work
S0343	yeah
S0336	at least like if it take like take me two hours this morning but i wasn't late for work so it didn't feel quite as bad but when you be set off that early and you think you're set off that early to try and avoid all that it's
S0343	but on a good day you can do it in an hour can't you
S0336	yeah on a good day like fridays be normally mean to be good so if i set off at half eight on a friday i'd normally be in the office for quarter past half past nine normally but
S0343	two hours be just take the piss innit
S0336	since i've get back after christmas i've i've maybe i've maybe do the journey twice in under an hour and that's it
S0343	that's crap
S0336	it's it's be take me so long recently it's really hard cos like i do get to work and i'm already piss off like when you have when you have like two hour long like just slow crap journey you get to work and you're already like shatter
S0343	yes
S0336	like it's be stressful and like just frustrate and like when you get to i get to work at half eight this morning and i think i've already be up two and a half hours i'm knackered and i've not do anything i haven't even start my day's work yet
S0343	yeah
S0336	but
S0336	i keep like the manager's be really understand about it and we talk about it a lot but it's hard like i don't like be that person at work that people like have to feel sorry for because i've get this horrible journey especially when i'm do it myself but it's really hard to like stay positive about it it's so shit it's hard i be like lift share for a bite as well
S0343	but winter's always crap
S0336	mm
S0343	in the summer the spring and summer be much better when it's daylight
S0336	yeah
S0343	you know when the roads be nice and dry and the sun's out and
S0336	i'm hop so
S0343	it it's so much nicer in the good weather
S0336	yeah i know i know i know it will get better and
S0343	it's crap in the dark it always be you know
S0336	i don't like the first three months i be there like i know it be i know six weeks of those be over the summer holiday and so there be a lot less er a lot fewer cars on the road anyway but the first few months i be there i have no real problems
S0343	yeah winter's crap
S0336	winter have be awful
S0343	it be crap
S0336	and like they've they've put like new park restrictions at work as well so like they've sell off like they've sell off a load of land so they've sell off a couple of build but with that like some of the park as well
S0343	yeah
S0336	so they've have to like completely renegotiate the car park scheme so like what they do be they've put a limit on it now so anyone within three miles can't apply for a park permit so anybody who live within three miles of have to get public transport or cycle or walk or whatever erm but then anybody outside of that can apply for a permit well the first time they do it they be quite strict and only give people that kind of fulfil all the criteria a permit but then they realise that there be often quite a lot of a space leave which be like obviously frustrate people that hadn't be give a permit so when it come round at christmas they review the situation and they think right well it might mean that some people don't get a space every so often but we might as well give x amount of people permit because they'll like so and so and so and so will only use it once in a blue moon
S0343	yeah
S0336	well get to work yesterday at bang on ten o'clock and there be no car park space like so i and literally it have already take me an hour and a half to get to work and it have be a pretty shit journey and you get to work
S0343	and then you can't park
S0336	and you then you can't fuck park i be so piss off and then like as soon as i get in my manager send me this email about punctuality and i want to hit the wall i be gonna kick off i be so angry she's like like and then she do apologise later because she sort of say like it wasn't appropriate to do it like when i be quite clearly still fume like i come in and i be so like i be already upset and then she send me that email and i be just like it's not like i'm not try she's like oh be there anything i can do to help and i'm like no like i will just have to set off even earlier like there's nothing we can do i have to leave two hours to get to work which be just ridiculous two hours two hours to get to work
S0343	it be it be ridiculous an hour's an hour's too long never mind two hours
S0336	well it's annoy it's a thirty five mile journey it should not be take me two hours to travel thirty five miles
S0337	should be
S0336	it's depress
S0337	forty five minutes
S0336	yeah it be
S0337	yeah
S0336	so depress especially like you're talk like seventy miles an hour for most of that journey
S0337	yeah well hopefully you'd be seventy miles per hour
S0336	yeah well what i'm say be limit wise
S0337	yeah
S0336	like i know i travel through the city but
S0337	yeah
S0336	i probably do like ten miles max in the city the other twenty five miles be like a1
S0337	a1
S0336	a14 m11
S0343	so it's you go down the m11 for the for one junction then
S0336	two junctions
S0343	two junctions
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah i can come off at or i can come off at and i play it by ear i mostly come off at but again like even with those junctions like it never feel like i pick the right one the other day they be queue onto the m11 for the turn so i carry on straight to they be do exactly the same there just have to join the back of the queue
S0343	yeah rubbish
S0336	it be rubbish
S0337	to seem like an absolute breeze doesn't it
S0336	yeah
S0337	in comparison
S0336	oh yeah cos even that like that's twenty six miles to
S0337	but but it isn't
S0336	but you you would do it in like you could do it in like thirty five forty minutes
S0337	forty minutes yeah
S0343	it seem really busy around about half seven eight o'clock and every time about half seven
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah
S0343	cos traffic come through be just nose to tail
S0337	oh yeah
S0336	no well we notice like when we when we be car share to like this time last year we notice that like the later you leave it like the more you kind of push it the more chance you have of kind of be on time it be really weird like
S0337	if you leave if you leave at half seven everyone's get the idea of i've get to get to work for nine i don't wanna be late i will go early but there be a few time we leave it like it be too late
S0336	yeah
S0337	but our journey be like half the time
S0336	yeah so we'd leave it like
S0337	but we we'd
S0336	we'd leave
S0337	i'd i'd be late to work
S0336	yeah we'd leave
S0337	but
S0336	at maybe like twenty past eight
S0343	yeah
S0336	sail straight in and you be push it by the time you get there
S0343	because
S0336	it's like nine o'clock
S0343	cos people have already go
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah and you be get there at nine o'clock on the dot and you know
S0337	yeah
S0336	if you do hit anything you will be late
S0337	yeah if something go wrong
S0336	yeah
S0337	it's gonna go really wrong yeah but but
S0336	but
S0337	most of the time you just
S0336	but
S0337	drive straight in
S0336	even from like i use to i use to leave my house at half past eight and i'd be at my desk for nine but if i try to leave at eight i'd still be in there at like ten to nine
S0343	yeah
S0337	yeah it's so much
S0336	it's so stupid so i just stop do it the more the more chance you take with it the better off you tend to be and even even now i've find that the case like more often than not like if i leave sometime between half past eight and nine o'clock normally i would get there before ten but it only take an accident
S0343	and that's it you're knackered
S0337	mm
S0343	that's the the a14 be a lousy road you know
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0337	drive back from
S0336	and yeah
S0337	on that friday morning erm obviously i drive to after say bye to you and erm yeah the amount of cars it be nose to tail and that be like must have be seven o'clock in the morning
S0343	yeah
S0337	like it it be constant like like there wasn't a break in the traffic and that's at seven in the morning
S0336	yeah
S0337	it's like
S0336	it be pretty depress to be honest
S0337	and it'll be like that until nine
S0336	yeah it be daft but like i literally i honestly can't believe you know like with all these all the developments they've make with satnavs and all that kind of stuff like traffic announcements just haven't catch up like you you you don't know about an accident until you're already in the traffic
S0343	almost on top of it yeah
S0337	yeah
S0336	and then it's too late to do anything like i mean the journey i take i don't really have a lot of room for like detour anyway
S0337	yeah
S0336	so like when you hit the traffic it's not like i go oh i can come off at this turn it's fine like i need to take that road like there's no there's no way round it but it be frustrate when like especially like if i've on on an occasion like especially like come in and out of the city centre there's definitely ways in an out i i know i know three different ways to get into and out of so if i know that one one way be block then i'd take the other but you there's just no way of know until you've actually get into then it's just block
S0343	then you wish you hadn't start it yeah
S0336	like it's so frustrate the worst it's the worst it's take me be two it's take me two and a half and a half hours to get to work before and annoyingly it happen on the same day i have a really shit journey into work so leave at half eight get in at eleven and then they say oh don't worry about work your time back cos that's the thing then you owe them time you're already have a fuck shit and they're like oh you owe us time great so i get in at eleven and they be like oh don't worry about pay back your time today otherwise it's just gonna be a really long day like head off as normal so then i head off i leave at half five i think and it take me two hours to get home as well eleven hour day and i only have like six hours at work great
S0343	rubbish
S0337	not cool rubbish
S0336	no
S0337	yeah
S0336	not fun i
S0343	do you want another one
S0336	i don't thank you
S0337	be a couple of days to
S0343	er
S0343	mm
S0337	take me twenty minutes to get to work it's not a fun twenty minutes should take me a lot less but
S0336	yeah it only ever take me
S0337	i can't
S0336	ten minutes
S0337	yeah i can't complain
S0343	the daily commute
S0337	yeah
S0343	everybody's bugbear
S0336	i don't i honestly don't know i don't know how people do what i'm do like long time like 's
S0337	in london
S0336	like 's dad yeah 's dad use to travel down towards london like grant he use to work from home two days a week but he use to do it three three time a week like er he he be work over like coventry way at some point as well like and he be leave at god know like but he would be up and go before you're even up in the morning and then he wouldn't get in till like a couple of hours after you in the even and i'm just think like
S0337	my dad do
S0336	yeah
S0337	to to for about thirty years and a few of those years he he'd have to work out of london of like a year on end and he'd drive to park up train down to london train back drive back to it's just
S0336	that's
S0337	it isn't it isn't it's not a lifestyle
S0336	no
S0337	i think but people do it don't they it's crazy
S0343	i think i do it for three months but i use to i use to i be work over at way so it wouldn't have be
S0337	one one road
S0343	so live in
S0337	mm
S0343	oh no i you didn't you'd go along the a47 and you use to go through erm use to go that way
S0337	okay
S0343	so i use to cut a chunk i i use to miss and
S0337	yeah
S0343	but i use to leave at half six and get into work at five to eight and then leave at quarter to five and get in for about quarter past half past six long go days though
S0336	yeah
S0343	and it be seventy seventy two miles or something so when you think i be i be do seventy two mile in an hour and a half
S0337	mm yeah
S0343	and you're take longer than that to do half that
S0337	yeah
S0343	half that distance
S0336	that's what that's the frustrate thing and that's what i find find hard to explain to people at work like it's not the distance it's just how hard that journey be like and like i've try to explain to my manager before like it's really stressful leave your house and honestly not know what time you're gonna get into work like you know after you've be at if if after you've be in a job for nine months you normally have a gauge of how long it take you to get to and from work but i've not get a fuck chance
S0337	get no routine i guess
S0336	no no chance i've like
S0343	it it be one of the worst roads in the country
S0336	yeah
S0343	i think the a14
S0336	you just can't do anything about it it's so annoy and it's hard cos i think like most people who commute do it for like i don't know more money or you know they have more responsibility and like mine's still very much an entry level job which mean like the motivation isn't quite there to go all that way
S0337	if you've not go somewhere to get there
S0336	yeah
S0337	so you've go there to get somewhere so to to put that on top of you it's just not it's not worth it really
S0336	stress it it's just it's like you know like when you're have those like internal monologues when you're stick in the traffic at least if you if you think like if i think i be go to work and it like the work be really important and like you know i be go in for meet and i be do this and like i have a purpose for get to then you'd kind of be able to justify all the shit but i'm sit there in the traffic think like i don't think it really matter if i get to work today like
S0336	i haven't get any meet i haven't get anyone that i need to see i haven't get anything that need do like urgently
S0337	nothing kick off yeah
S0336	nothing's kick off yeah it's really weird
S0343	it will
S0337	yeah
S0336	i hope so
S0343	it it will as the you know as you get the time
S0343	it's just a shame you've get that journey
S0337	yeah
S0343	so be the train be a train not an option
S0336	it's so expensive
S0343	be it
S0336	just yeah it's like two hundred and eighty pound a month it's just
S0337	we yeah we look at sell your car but that wouldn't last long would it the money we'd get
S0336	the money so say
S0337	yeah
S0336	well i get nine hundred pound for my car so it would have it would have buy me three months' train travel and then i'd have have two hundred and eighty pound go out of my account like even before i switch my car it be only cost me two hundred a month in petrol and with my new car i'm expect those cost to like nearly half i should be pay about a hundred and twenty pound a month i think in fuel
S0343	good
S0336	so it's like less than half what the train would cost me
S0343	and it would be a nicer journey
S0337	yeah well
S0336	so it's just
S0336	well yeah but it's it's like the thing be
S0343	no more comfortable in the car
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah
S0336	it be and like the problem be be that train the train from to aren't actually that regular they're one every hour so like in term of flexibility of work hours it's really really hard because i the there's only two train i could get in the morning quarter past seven or quarter past eight
S0343	right
S0337	and they're full
S0336	and they're full and the only
S0337	and they take
S0336	the only train i can get home be five or six o'clock
S0337	and they take a while as well don't they
S0336	it's shit
S0337	they take a while and they cost a lot and they're full and you're stick to do those time so you're stick do a terrible car journey that could go like really bad but it's cheaper you don't have to deal with like the limit in time but you have to deal with like the crappy roads but you get get the but the train you'd spend a lot more
S0343	spend a lot more money
S0337	yeah
S0343	probably have to stand up
S0337	yeah
S0343	all the way
S0336	well this be the thing cos as soon as you've get a season ticket you don't get a seat you only get a seat if you like pre book so if you've buy like advance ticket season ticket holders don't aren't ever guarantee a seat so
S0343	so you could end up stand all the way stand all the way to
S0336	yeah
S0337	for an hour
S0343	yeah nightmare
S0337	it's crap
S0343	and you've get a season ticket
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah and you're pay three hundred pound for the privilege no thank
S0343	crap
S0336	yeah pretty crap
S0343	shall we er shall we go then
S0336	yeah
S0337	yeah just have a
S0336	take a swig
