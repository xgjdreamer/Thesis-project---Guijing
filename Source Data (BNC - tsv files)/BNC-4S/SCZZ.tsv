S0530	i use to think feline be a female cat but it's just a cat isn't it
S0529	mm cos cat be just female like with the french
S0530	mm it's weird how we gender animals isn't it
S0529	mm
S0531	i know
S0530	like dog and yeah
S0529	yeah
S0531	oh this be really cool i get to draw my own line
S0530	ah da da da da da da da da da da da da da i wanna be in that number hello from the outside have we get a new flat member we haven't have we cos there's this new girl that's always here i don't know if she's friends with or but she's here quite a lot
S0529	yeah
S0531	i've see her
S0530	maybe bring her home but i didn't know if she'd move in a bite later on or something
S0529	mm
S0530	i can't believe that students in china they have to pass or they can't go back to the country it's crazy
S0531	they've get a crazy system
S0530	i wonder how like fuck up they be though
S0531	it's shit basically and
S0530	but like mentally
S0531	yeah
S0530	but there's a lot of pressure on people in this country but then if you think about other countries
S0531	in korea it's it's horrible japan and korea and i think china
S0530	pretty
S0531	suicide rat in the world
S0530	wow
S0531	i think someone commit suicide in korea every forty second
S0530	really
S0531	and during exams they have to erm have like either people guard or people block off the erm roof the pathways because if a kid be in the middle of an exam and they realise that they're not go to be able to pass or they're not go to be able to get top mark then it's very likely that they will try to get to the roof to kill themselves like
S0530	that's crazy
S0531	they have
S0529	hiya
S0531	they have erm extremely erm i think like
S0530	yeah
S0531	something that
S0530	yeah
S0531	something that then make it so that although er the general make it that erm basically it's really competitive job wise and there be only three universities in korea that be sort of like worth go to
S0530	mm
S0531	erm and basically you're tell pretty much from like a child that if you don't get into this university you you're not worth that you're not worth
S0530	wow wow
S0531	which be kind of that's i mean it's university's all that matter really erm so yeah bite shit really
S0530	that's horrible
S0531	erm er so yeah like basically if you don't get into one of these three unis
S0530	jesus
S0531	there be people like they go into an exam to like entrance exams for these universities and they couldn't get in with the point they can't go to the fourth one
S0530	mm oh my god
S0531	they're erm at work it's extremely stressful there's a lot of like erm like problems like sexual harassment
S0530	mm
S0531	erm and that kind of thing erm and then they don't have er like a er welfare system like for pensioners so they pretty much for pensioners just rely on their children to look after them when they're old age
S0530	mm
S0531	it's like i don't think they have a state pension erm so
S0529	wow
S0531	basically when you're a teenager life be shit cos you can't get into when you're at work life be shit cos you're deal with like you know whatever like they have when you apply for a job in korea you have to submit a picture of yourself
S0530	really
S0531	just so they know what you look like before they hire you
S0530	why
S0531	erm i dunno maybe discrimination erm er and then when you're a pensioner when you're older life be shit and i mean i wouldn't
S0530	it's a shit whole life basically then
S0531	i i love like korean culture and i love like the movies and the music and everything but i wouldn't ever
S0530	you wouldn't ever wanna live over there
S0531	i mean maybe i'd live there like erm it's get more progressive erm and i i might like like like for fun kind of just go there for like once in a lifetime sort of thing but erm no i wouldn't i wouldn't wanna i wouldn't wanna raise a family there or or anything like that
S0530	no
S0531	that would be too much mm
S0530	i do a vole again ah dear

S0530	don't let yourself be kick out don't let them kick you don't let them throw you just ha cos right okay two thousand word you could potentially do if you get like say a thousand do tonight which sound crazy now but when you
S0531	or you would still get mark even if you didn't write two thousand word
S0530	yeah you would that be very true
S0531	mm just
S0530	something
S0531	a thousand word erm all you'll just get be crap score but it'll that's less a lot less than zero cos at least with a low score it'll
S0530	that be an incredibly good point
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos you you would have
S0531	even if you write a thousand word even five hundred word to get like three out of a hundred
S0530	mm mm
S0531	they'll just look at that and be like oh there's definitely a hell of a lot of room for improvement whereas if you give in something that say zero up
S0530	it's like she's not hand it in
S0531	like do she even try so write like even if it's just five hundred word it's something
S0530	mm mm she's right you know
S0529	back to harry potter
S0530	yeah
S0529	ah
S0531	i just ah can't be bother there's pasta in it anyway i mean there's a bite of sauce there ah i dunno how to cook well i know how to cook spaghetti but i'm really bad at judge how much i
S0530	yeah same i'm like that with every single carbohydrate
S0531	cos it expand so much but i don't wanna be hungry afterwards
S0529	that's probably enough
S0531	do you think would you say so

S0530	mm
S0529	that's what i do
S0531	i always just like if you put your thumb in press against each other
S0530	oh my god
S0531	and break it without it fall everywhere
S0530	that's really cruel
