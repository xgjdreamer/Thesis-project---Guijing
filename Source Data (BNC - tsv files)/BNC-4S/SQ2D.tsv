S0013	mm
S0144	how do they do that
S0024	i don't know they go up with some machine and untwist it
S0012	i expect they just put one of them drill in and put it on backwards
S0144	you wouldn't get that on the nhs would you
S0024	she be in the no
S0013	i know she's have everything do today
S0024	yes she's have everything do
S0013	awful
S0024	and they put her out
S0024	they knock her out to do it
S0144	do they
S0013	go both ways for
S0012	yeah
S0013	through her digestive track mm
S0024	mm

S0024	mm these be lovely
S0144	yes so now she know she can get all this fantastic treatment
S0012	yeah but apparently today's treatment be accord to her thousands of jds
S0024	mm hm she's get to be careful because she all of this stuff she have today she'd have never walk into nhs and get basically you have to go on a wait list and everything like that
S0144	wait about three years
S0024	they haven't get the staff to be able to do it i mean what she have today be the private healthcare option
S0013	mm
S0012	i just hope she doesn't have to pay for it
S0024	and just cos they say pay later ooh dear well
S0012	they say her employers be suppose to pay that's what the doctor at the
S0024	she have everything
S0144	mm
S0024	and they they test for everything didn't they
S0012	and they put her under
S0013	yeah
S0144	right
S0013	yeah come round she didn't even know didn't even feel like they have be there so that's good innit
S0012	and she hadn't get a sore throat don't they call that endoscopy something like that
S0024	it be amaze some of those healthcare options but it's the same here if you have like the private healthcare
S0144	i don't know
S0024	but the nhs just can't afford to do that kind of thing test people for everything can they do you remember he use to have his like when when they find out he go to the like they try to test him but they didn't do enough test
S0012	no
S0024	to be able to so he go and pay for private healthcare and stay there the whole day do and they do every single test under the sun on him and then and then that's when he find out he have crohn's disease and then from then onwards he could be treat by the nhs but it's all of the test cos they cost a fortune
S0012	mm
S0144	really
S0024	they can't do all of those test for everybody
S0144	that's like my mum isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	she's be try to find out what be wrong with her for about eight years now
S0012	yeah
S0024	yeah i be wonder whether she
S0144	and they still don't know
S0024	yeah i be wonder whether
S0144	that's because they're always play golf
S0012	mm
S0024	no well
S0012	no the trouble be you see how how our system be every time you you get something wrong you see a different person
S0144	yeah exactly that's the problem
S0024	yeah that's what the problem be yeah
S0144	cos every time she go back to see our specialist he's either on holiday or something so she have to see someone else who doesn't know her history which be really complicate
S0012	yeah
S0144	so don't know
S0013	they should just be look it up
S0144	mm
S0024	mm
S0013	they should just be look up her all history
S0024	they they can look it up but when they don't
S0144	yeah i think
S0024	when they haven't see her and you know in different situations they can't
S0012	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0012	you say they should be look it up
S0024	it's not the same
S0012	but you go up to our doctor and they didn't even know you'd be to hospital with a break wrist
S0013	yeah but that be a mistake wasn't it
S0012	it be a big mistake
S0013	mm
S0012	they lose all mum's history up the hospital about her break wrist that she go back to get the plaster on and they say oh you needn't have it then
S0013	we get the feel that it be deliberately wipe off hadn't we
S0012	mm
S0024	i go down here and and they say um we'd like you to see like a specialist plastic surgeon for your head and i say no thank you i don't wanna see plastic and cos they be they keep go on about cosmetic surgery
S0012	mm
S0024	and i be go no i don't want that i just want to talk to someone about something else and they keep go on about it and then three years later when they get my doctor's note they say oh i i see here in your note you saw a specialist cos that's when i do go and see a specialist at the university do you remember
S0144	yeah
S0024	and say you saw a specialist when you be eighteen i say no i didn't and they show me all of the note and a signature to say i'd be to hospital when i be eighteen and i never go
S0013	ooh
S0024	and i think the doctor might have cover their back or something
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't know i don't know what it be
S0144	they're useless
S0024	i i couldn't have completely forget unless they knock me out

S0012	i can't you can't do anything and if if i if it's glue in the wrong place it won't work anyway anymore
S0024	really
S0012	yeah
S0024	why it's just that
S0012	because it won't be able to
S0024	but all it be be the door it's so frustrate
S0012	it be frustrate yeah
S0024	because mm the microwave work
S0013	it's a brilliant microwave
S0012	it's a brilliant microwave and a stupid poxy panasonic plastic bite
S0013	it do everything really we hardly use it for anything else
S0012	they make a microwave for two hundred quid and they stick a stupid little plastic bite in it that wear out and break within a year
S0024	oh so that you buy another one but actually go well the microwave be actually very good so let's get the same one it be only the stupid little plastic bite on the door that stop it from work but yeah
S0012	i wonder if they've update cos on the net they they reckon that this be the problem with panasonic use cheapskate designers
S0144	yeah
S0012	they're good designers with all the rest of them but
S0024	you like panasonic
S0012	yeah
S0024	you've get panasonic
S0012	they're good designers with the electronics
S0024	yeah
S0012	but when it come to the actual work piece with the mechanical piece
S0024	yeah
S0012	they reckon their designers be use useless so do i look at that there
S0024	so you do you do you get most panasonic or televisions panasonic and the thingies
S0012	we change over to panasonic because sony get too expensive
S0024	and your i think yeah i think you be sony people
S0012	we be sony people
S0013	part and part
S0024	i don't know what i would choose i don't know
S0144	i'd choose what the cheapest
S0024	yeah and then they'd just break
S0144	not necessarily i like samsung actually
S0012	samsung be good now yeah yeah yeah
S0024	i like samsung
S0144	although they've start ship their manufacture over to china
S0012	yeah
S0144	so they've go cheap as well
S0024	yes so they're all the same now
S0144	well everyone get manufacture in china now so
S0012	and yeah
S0144	there's not much difference really
S0024	well i think samsung them aren't they gonna get the north koreans to make some
S0012	when we be when we be work on the asphalt we have to go and asphalt sony's factory down at and they use to produce these little tiny chip that go in in eh transistor radio
S0144	mm
S0024	mm
S0012	cos transistor radio be the big thing then weren't they and they have these chip about that big
