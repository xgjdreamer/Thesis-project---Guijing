S0144	mm
S0024	no hotmail's not work at all look it's all the whole website's
S0144	mm it's weird these obsessions isn't it
S0012	it's terrible isn't it
S0144	yeah
S0024	everybody's get some sort of obsession on a but it's all on a scale
S0144	mm
S0024	so
S0013	mm
S0024	some people just have it
S0144	i remember when i be about well i think it's it's particularly bad when you're younger as well
S0012	that be yeah yeah
S0144	and if you keep do it then it just it get reinforce doesn't it
S0013	yeah
S0144	i remember every in the house i live in before i get to the third the third to last step
S0012	yeah
S0144	i have to turn around
S0012	oh right yeah
S0013	oh
S0144	and for no reason well actually i do think there be someone look at me but every time i do it i have to do it otherwise this person be go to get me
S0013	yeah
S0012	you have feel like that don't you you do have feel like that
S0144	yeah it's weird
S0013	well it's quite common to to look in all the wardrobes before you go to bed isn't it when you're little
S0024	mm
S0144	yeah
S0012	i use to look under the bed i use to look under the bed when i be little
S0144	yeah
S0024	i have a friend who i have to go and look under her we be stay in a hotel when we be nineteen
S0013	oh gosh
S0024	in in america and i have to go in and look under her bed before she go to sleep
S0013	really
S0012	one obsession i use to have
S0024	yeah because that's because it be her habit but because she still live at home
S0012	yeah
S0024	well no she always have somebody there to look under the bed
S0013	wow
S0144	hmm
S0012	one obsession i use to have when i be a kid be to count the star on this wallpaper every day all the cos mum use to have this really horrible wallpaper and it use to have all these bits all over it and i'd count them count them count them count them
S0144	yeah
S0024	but once you start do that then you'd then you don't stop
S0013	i have starry ceiling paper i do when i be little
S0144	you have starry ceiling paper do you use to count the star on that then
S0013	it be it be do like the proper star
S0144	oh right
S0024	ah like oh really that would be nice
S0013	mm yeah
S0012	really
S0024	i like that
S0013	it be nice
S0024	like the real night sky on your ceiling
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah that would be good wouldn't it
S0144	mm
S0012	but then when people doodle or have nothing to do you find yourself line things up
S0024	no you don't
S0012	yes you do i do
S0024	honestly
S0012	line them up like that you see and get it right
S0024	that's what you like to do well what everything
S0012	yes everything
S0024	ah
S0012	except when i look at
S0013	before
S0024	huh
S0012	hello good morning we're lovely and you you've get a very spotty oh dear shall i i'll go on skype i'll put skype on
S0144	it's
S0024	she have get chickenpox she have get chicken isn't that weird
S0144	she's get chicken pox
S0012	yeah
S0024	just three little spot and you can tell what they've get say oh i think she's get chickenpox
S0013	mm
S0024	and then she's come out all spotty oh see she's a terrible scratcher i should get her some mittens for her birthday
S0013	you reckon
S0144	maybe that's where it start when you've get chickenpox and you're make to wear mittens and then you associate the mittens with the chickenpox
S0024	urgh scratch
S0144	if you don't wear the mittens then you're gonna get spread disease
S0024	oh what cos you're tell don't touch that
S0144	yeah
S0024	don't touch don't touch don't touch when you've get chickenpox
S0144	mm yeah
S0024	well otherwise everybody would be a bite obsess with scratch and not scratch and i don't know that many people who be like that
S0144	mm
S0024	i be gonna
S0144	it's so weird though isn't it what how people's brain work weird things
S0024	but i think i think with erm train you can get most of the time you can get out of it but there's these extreme case
S0144	oh yeah
S0024	but like like when you have a deep engross habit like that it's practice can get you out of it
S0144	but some mm there's something in our brain that make us do it
S0024	yeah
S0144	cos everyone go through it at some stage
S0024	it's like yeah it's like all that routine there's some sort of weird robotic routine thing that's in our brain
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	that we want some sort of schedule or some sort of something that we do all the time the same
S0144	yeah
S0024	get up do this and walk into the room and count
S0144	i wonder if they've identify the gene for that cos that's quite an important one because people could use as well
S0024	they could manipulate that gene to make us all robots
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	robotic mm
S0144	that's that's a good story that be
S0024	and then and then you just train them to do repetitive action or to do
S0144	yeah but there's no uniformity in it be there i mean it could be anything whether you're count leave on a plant or
S0024	mm
S0144	or check the door's lock ten time you've get no way of make the obsession
S0024	it's just pure habit though
S0144	mm yeah that's strange hmm
S0024	like people can't sleep or can't rest until they know that they've lock the door a hundred time or test the door handle seven time
S0144	mm
S0024	turn around three time and
S0144	mm you're like that with some doors aren't you we leave the house and i say have you lock the door you have to go back yeah just
S0024	with lock oh yeah i'll probably check that and back but i've get no particular number i wouldn't like go back and check it three time
S0144	oh yeah
S0024	i'd go back and check it maybe twice one day maybe seven time the next day
S0144	mm
S0024	and the gas i do check but i that's a check check check but that's not specific
S0144	yeah but you don't trust yourself enough in your head to go yeah i do that
S0024	mhm
S0144	and you have to go and check it
S0024	no yeah but that's different
S0144	i don't know cos that's what lead to you check it twice and then have a a safety number so you check it like three time
S0024	but the reason i check it again be because i don't remember check it in the first place
S0144	mm
S0024	so if i don't remember check it how be i go suppose to remember to count the three time i i wouldn't be able to do that i'll be i'll check cos i check it
S0144	yeah but that
S0024	but then i walk away and i do i do it didn't i do do i do it didn't i do it i'll go back and do it
S0144	yeah that's why they have the ritual of like you do everything like three time
S0024	mm
S0144	so you know you're go to do it three time so when you leave you know you've do it three time
S0024	okay yeah yeah i see that
S0144	but then but then it get to the point where you do it three time but you didn't do it right because your hand wasn't in the right position or something so you have to go and do it another three time and then and then someone make a noise while you be do it so that one doesn't count so you've get to do it again
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	it just become insanity
S0024	yeah but it can happen to anybody
S0144	oh yeah
S0024	i don't think there's a genetic disposition i think there's
S0144	it can no there must be something
S0024	no i think it can happen to absolutely anybody under the right circumstances
S0144	oh i do as well yeah yeah
S0024	they've get a new name for erm the mixture of genetics and environment i've forget oh i've forget the name of it
S0144	a mixture of nature and nurture
S0024	yeah they've there's a new theory which balance it up it's probably not new it's not a new theory but they've give a name to it oh what be it anyway i don't think it's anything with genetics that particular action i think that's pure environment i think it can happen to anyone
S0144	do you i don't
S0024	no
S0144	i think there's definitely a gene which some people be more
S0024	prone to it
S0144	prone to it but i agree everyone's get it
S0024	mhm i think it's
S0144	so everyone's but it's like anything isn't it
S0024	everybody get it to some sort of degree
S0144	everything's on a slide scale
S0024	so surely you can make that worse or make it better depend on your environment
S0144	mm
S0024	no i think i don't think it's genetic at all
S0144	you don't think it's genetic at all but you say it's on a slide scale which mean it's genetic
S0024	yeah everybody's get it genetically but it's not it's not like right you're go to have ocd because it's in your genes i don't believe that i think it's all to do with the environment
S0144	oh no it need a trigger
S0024	and and how
S0144	a social trigger
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	and how you've practise and rituals that you've develop and rituals you've copy and the routines that you're like that
S0144	yeah when er mm
S0024	so i think if if i put myself in a weird situation where i start check the door three time or i start count erm things in this room every time i come in this room then i can develop a weird problem
S0144	mm
S0024	through habit you know i want to go and see spotty
S0144	go in there a minute then
S0024	oh she she just look a bite wear out really she doesn't look
S0144	well she wasn't well when we be down there
S0024	no god she have that cold and
S0144	well kid do though don't they
S0024	at least she keep herself busy she keep herself busy work through it
S0144	yeah
S0024	that's another weird ritual people have like if they get sick you get those people that if they get a little bite sick then their treatment be lie down and recover and don't do a thing until they're better
S0144	mm
S0024	or you get the people that work through it and work work work
S0144	that's not a ritual that's
S0024	that be that's from when you're a little kid and you're your mum and dad let you continue to play continue to go outside or they tuck you up in bed and say sleep darling sleep
S0144	that's just what you've be teach
S0024	well that's exactly
S0144	that's not a ritual
S0024	but then when you're older that become part of you of how you get better
S0144	mm
S0024	and that's all that you know
S0144	mm
S0024	so i think it's all a similar thing of how you've develop your behaviour
S0144	like cultural reality isn't it
S0024	it's just you develop your behaviours and it's difficult to change when you're older
S0144	mm
S0024	and it just and i don't know but i don't know what i'm talk about
S0144	yeah but it's only possible to develop that behaviour because it you've get some genetic makeup for it to build it upon
S0024	yeah but everybody's get it
S0144	yeah
S0024	so it's not a predisposition to be
S0144	no so you so it be a mixture of both
S0024	it be but there's not a predisposition this person's go to become ocd when they're older like if you look at all of their genes ah and they find the gene for it they they would like down's or something like that or some other disease
S0144	mm yeah but no
S0024	you where where they can look at the genes and say i'm afraid you're gonna unfortunately have this problem
S0144	yeah
S0024	that kind of psychological problem they'll never be able to tell they could tell maybe they've get a oh i don't know
S0144	well it's the same with alcoholism isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	they they say that that's genetic
S0024	no no no
S0144	but i don't
S0024	i don't think it be
S0144	i don't think it be either i think everyone's get that gene to have it become a problem but i think it's a product of your social environment
S0024	yeah yeah yeah that's what i think too yeah
S0144	mm
S0024	because you can see how everybody have get a little bite of something
S0144	yeah
S0024	everybody's weirdos everybody's a weirdo
S0144	mm
S0024	it's just how
S0144	mm she need a certain amount of life i don't know type of event like a traumatic experience or a very stressful situation when like you've get these tolerances haven't you and these things that you build these wall to stop this stuff get in
S0024	mm mm
S0144	but if you go through a traumatic experience these wall get break down and make you more vulnerable for things like this to get in
S0024	yeah
S0144	and then because a lot of the time they they become manifest in after a big event or a
S0024	i yeah mm yeah i think that can happen but also they can be manifest through boredom
S0144	do you not think boredom yeah yeah
S0024	through not know what to do with your time through mismanagement of your time or something
S0144	mm
S0024	you know not necessarily a big event i think it could be a gradual process of what shall i do today
S0144	mm well that's depression isn't it
S0024	well yeah yeah depression then okay not boredom depression
S0144	mm which be
S0024	lie in bed count the things on your ceiling or something
S0144	cos you've get nothing else to do
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	yeah yeah you need to keep active and do stuff don't you
S0024	and then it just become a habit and it become a life
S0144	and that and that basically be everything isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	each need to keep active keep yourself interest in do stuff
S0024	yeah i think so
S0144	and it will keep a hell of a lot of problems at bay just by do that cos everything stem from you get a little bite depress or anything like that
S0024	when you sit i mean i everybody's be through like oh oh i can't be bother to do anything today oh oh i'll just go and sit somewhere
S0144	mm
S0024	or sit and even play a stupid computer game or do something that take your mind off things but in do that you're take your mind off your problems but then you're do something stupid like count or
S0144	mm mm yeah like get a box set of a tv show or something and just sit down and watch it all
S0024	that's where facebook be actually quite a good thing because if that become like a somebody's habit for you know they're actually still communicate with people they're not sit in a room
S0144	can you count that as communication
S0024	mm i suppose not no but i mean it's better than sit there with a little tiny game boy play a game or on your telephone play the game on your telephone or something like that
S0144	yeah well mm i suppose it do count as communication because you be get a response to a certain extent
S0024	yeah but i know it's isolate it's isolate communication
S0144	it's impersonal
S0024	but some people you know some people have chat with their friends on it all of the time and
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then it depend how you use it
S0144	i don't know it's completely different isn't it
S0024	but that as a distraction for your life
S0144	mm
S0024	isn't so bad compare to i don't know sit in a room star into space
S0144	but it be a distraction for life which be bad
S0024	yeah yeah i suppose so i don't know i better go and say goodbye that skype she have such problems with that skype it's just freeze
S0144	mm
S0024	and i think she can hear everything that we say but then we end up star at the screen go oh i can't hear them mm can't hear them but she can hear the other side
S0144	mm we can't hear you
S0024	yeah
S0144	i'm gonna talk really silly now
S0024	shout we can't hear you she's like get deafen the other side
S0144	mm be they go tomorrow
S0024	they're go tomorrow
S0144	i think they be go on thursday
S0024	no wednesday
S0144	where be we go then friday
S0024	we're go out friday
S0144	oh they're go tomorrow
S0024	yeah that's why they're pack
S0144	yeah house party
S0024	that's why they've be pack and make bread all day
S0144	oh i wonder i think they be just be extremely er well organise
S0024	she's make cake no
S0144	i be like uh if i be go away i would do it ten minutes before oh
S0024	that's why shop yesterday be so important because they say i've get we've get no time to do it on tuesday i think they've get to go see her that erm little old lady be down the road before they go away
S0144	mm
S0024	yeah they'll just check it
S0144	mm
S0024	i think that's what they're go to do
S0144	mhm right okay
S0024	she didn't she be not wear mittens
S0144	
S0024	yeah
S0144	well they're not at the scratchy stage yet be they
S0024	but do you see when we be there she be scratchy scratch her stomach to bits i have to put cream
S0144	well that must be a genetic thing because you do that you do it with your neck you like scratch things
S0024	it's a nervous thing
S0144	nervous
S0024	i don't know i need to cut my my nail be so sharp
S0144	yeah i'm go to start i'm go to give you mittens
S0024	i'll try
S0144	yeah the chickenpox only get scratchy once they become erm what do you call it
S0024	pussy
S0144	well once they start scabbing over a bite yeah
S0024	oh i see
S0144	and then that become itchy
S0024	right and then if you pick them off you get scar like this one here have you see my chickenpox scar
S0144	yeah when they first
S0024	my chicken chickenpox scar i can't say that chickenpox scar
S0144	chickenpox scar
S0024	there
S0144	mm yeah can you see mine
S0024	there
S0144	yeah
S0024	huh you only get one as well
S0144	er yeah think so
S0024	i've only get one
S0144	well maybe down there
S0024	you don't really get them on the rest of your body do you
S0144	just on your face no well i think your face scar a bite easier
S0024	why mm i don't mind have one
S0144	but when be they erm what do you call them not contaminate erm
S0024	contagious
S0144	contagious when they're itchy or
S0024	er no i think now no i think now she should 's go to have to have a chickenpox party around her house or something
S0144	that would make sense because you're scratch it and spread it and get it in your nail and
S0024	come on everybody huh now what happen with 's work if 's get chickenpox she should be allow to go to nursery i think because then all the kid get chickenpox and everybody will be happy but some parent aren't like that any more be they they've change
S0144	well no you send your kid to nursery with chickenpox you'll probably get it take off you by social service
S0024	i don't know what will happen
S0144	from neglect
S0024	yeah but from neglect
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't know what will happen but she you know how be she go to take time off work to look after her kid with
S0144	mm
S0024	see like mum and dad when they be childminders they use to let all the kid come here if they have chickenpox and the parent use to still go to work which be fine
S0144	yeah it should be just as long as the parent have have have it
S0024	it's like you just phone around the other parent yeah and you phone around the other parent and say
S0144	mm you should let people know
S0024	do you want your kid to have chickenpox yes or no
S0144	mm
S0024	i mean surely all the they know that they have to have it
S0144	mm
S0024	i think have all of those jab when she be baby
S0144	you can't have a jab for chickenpox
S0024	can't you
S0144	no
S0024	you could have oh measles she have her mmr
S0144	measles mumps rubella
S0024	yeah she have mmr
S0144	what when she be
S0024	little baby
S0144	no i don't agree with that
S0024	think she do she have the flu one as well
S0144	i mean put pump all of that shit into a little baby's blood be sick
S0024	yeah but then yeah but then you know like mum say about my whoop cough nearly kill me the whoop cough do

S0024	and they still have to pay

S0012	like them
S0144	yeah it's funny isn't it most animals be their the fear instinct be fear of be eat by another animal
S0012	yeah
S0144	but with humans the fear be of of death
S0012	the yeah that's right yeah
S0144	it could come in a variety of different ways
S0012	yeah yeah
S0144	in it could be scar of cross a road or scar that someone's go to come round and do you or scar that you're go to catch something or
S0012	yeah yeah that's right yeah
S0144	it's weird or just scar of old age a lot of people aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	well that's that's the big thing to be scar of because the older you get the nearer death you be aren't you

S0012	the joke that er i can't remember it all so and it be only about the devil he's keep he one of them go to heaven and he think this be bore so bore with all the angels play harp and what have you well he say you can nip down and have a look what it's like in hell if you like if you want to stay there you can so he say yeah okay so he go down and go down to hell and there be all these people stand drink tea have wonderful time wine whiskey song women the lot but they be in this great big lake of sewage and er after about ten minutes the devil come along he say right tea break over stand on your head in the sewer
S0012	something like that anyway

S0024	oh
S0144	mm
S0012	and that be just the ten minute tea break
S0012	tell us that the other week
S0144	yeah well heaven and hell's a stupid idea anyway isn't it
S0012	it be isn't it when you think about it
S0144	yeah i mean heaven would be hell
S0012	if yeah if if god really love you as they say he wouldn't punish you would he because god sort of be suppose to love you so why should he say you're go to see my brother lucifer cos that's
S0013	brother
S0012	that be his brother
S0144	yeah
S0024	well it be a fall angel
S0012	yeah fall angel he use to sit by his side that weren't his brother that be his choose one wasn't it
S0144	yeah yeah yeah and if if heaven be so perfect that would that would become hellish because you need bad things to happen to appreciate the good things
S0012	well you you yes you need something you need you need opposites don't you
S0144	you can't have a constant paradise cos that would become have a constant of anything would become monotony and and hellish in itself
S0012	yeah that would wouldn't it
S0144	you need a a wide variety of evil and good to
S0013	to know what's good and
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0024	do you though do you
S0144	hmm
S0024	you need some bad things to happen to know what's good
S0144	i think so
S0012	well
S0144	otherwise you've get nothing to judge it against
S0012	that's yeah
S0144	or
S0012	yeah it's like pain isn't it i mean if you don't have pain you don't you would never know what be be like but just so to to be good again
S0144	mm
S0024	but you forget it fairly quickly
S0012	you forget pain very quickly
S0013	luckily yeah
S0012	i forget it i forget all the pain i suffer when when give birth to you lot
S0024	and you get
S0144	mm
S0024	and you get use to it and it can become just normality
S0013	yes you can yeah
S0012	yeah yeah
S0144	but when you're extremely happy i mean that's because of the serotonin in the release the the dopamine or whatever
S0012	yeah dopamine or endomorphin yeah
S0144	so it's a chemical reaction but be it not also a memory of be like in a depress place as well
S0012	depress state yeah yeah
S0144	and so oh wow we're not think this consciously but be aware that there's that big difference
S0012	yeah well you i suppose you could you could really say that winter be the miserable month months and summer be and spring be the happy and you you you have you have to have a winter before you appreciate spring
S0013	that's why you appreciate
S0144	yeah exactly
S0024	but winter be beautiful in so many ways and evil be not beautiful
S0012	yes but it can be so miserable
S0144	yeah but if you live in the north pole like the inuits where they've just get darkness for
S0012	six months of the year yeah
S0144	i mean they they've get the highest suicide rat
S0012	yeah that's that's the lack of light one isn't it the
S0144	yeah but i also think it's because there's no difference there's no change
S0012	no there's that's right the change isn't there we have four season well sometimes seven or eight i mean this this be the wrong type of weather for march there's usually march wind and wind and rain and it ruin all the daffodils and everything snuff it but we have a sharp frost this morning
